FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light and can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, monitor, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize the Company’s proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 6,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting and contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2023 and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 . The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (UDC Korea), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 7 Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation Certain prior year adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities have been reclassified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform to the current year presentation. These adjustments have been consolidated into their respective operating assets and liabilities accounts, specifically, inventory, other current assets, other assets and deferred revenue. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. The impairment in the value of minority equity investments is included in the other (loss) income, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included 8 in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, they are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the sales-based portion of royalty revenue based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or predetermined rates on a contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. On December 2, 2022, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase red and green phosphorescent emitter materials from the Company for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This amount purchased is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. 9 In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the lives of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the facilities of the Company's manufacturing partner, PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) and at the Company's internal facilities. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA), BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm Corporation ( Fujifilm). The Merck KGaA acquisition was completed on April 28, 2023. The BASF and Fujifilm acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over 10 a period of 10 years for the Merck KGaA and BASF patents. The Fujifilm acquired technology was fully amortized over a period of 10 years that ended in July 2022. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland and UDC Korea subsidiaries are also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its respective local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 % . Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved, and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . Under this standard, a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring the security's fair value. The standard also requires certain disclosures for equity securities that are subject to contractual restrictions. ASU 2022-03 becomes effective January 1, 2024, and the Company is evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its investments. 11 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of marketable fixed income securities consists of U.S. Government bonds and corporate bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value September 30, 2023 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 77,550 $ — $ — $ 77,550 Money market accounts 1,773 — — 1,773 $ 79,323 $ — $ — $ 79,323 December 31, 2022 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 86,268 $ — $ — $ 86,268 Money market accounts 7,162 — — 7,162 $ 93,430 $ — $ — $ 93,430 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value September 30, 2023 Corporate bonds $ 2,386 $ 3 $ ( 16 ) $ 2,373 U.S. Government bonds 412,539 — ( 2,562 ) 409,977 $ 414,925 $ 3 $ ( 2,578 ) $ 412,350 December 31, 2022 Corporate bonds 150,698 — ( 910 ) 149,788 U.S. Government bonds 339,472 32 ( 4,947 ) 334,557 $ 490,170 $ 32 $ ( 5,857 ) $ 484,345 Long-term Corporate Bonds and U.S. Government Bonds Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of long-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Long-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value September 30, 2023 Corporate bonds $ 128 $ — $ ( 118 ) $ 10 U.S. Government bonds 289,024 — ( 1,887 ) 287,137 $ 289,152 $ — $ ( 2,005 ) $ 287,147 December 31, 2022 Corporate bonds $ 2,479 $ — $ ( 28 ) $ 2,451 U.S. Government bonds 247,464 52 ( 2,152 ) 245,364 $ 249,943 $ 52 $ ( 2,180 ) $ 247,815 Long-term Minority Investments 12 The Company’s portfolio of minority investments consists of investments in privately held early-stage companies primarily motivated for the Company to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company typically does not seek to obtain representation on the boards of directors of the companies in which it invests. Minority investments are included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2023 , the Company had minority investments in five entities with a total carrying value of $ 14.0 million accounted for as equity securities without readily determinable fair values, as compared to four minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 12.0 million as of December 31, 2022. 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of September 30, 2023 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 1,773 $ 1,773 $ — $ — Short-term Corporate bonds investments 2,373 2,373 — — Short-term U.S. Government bonds investments 409,977 409,977 — — Long-term Corporate bonds investments 10 10 — — Long-term U.S. Government bonds investments 287,137 287,137 — — The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 7,162 $ 7,162 $ — $ — Short-term Corporate bonds investments 149,788 149,788 — — Short-term U.S. Government bonds investments 334,557 334,557 — — Long-term Corporate bonds investments 2,451 2,451 — — Long-term U.S. Government bonds investments 245,364 245,364 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other (loss) income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of September 30, 2023 or December 31, 2022 . 5. INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Raw materials $ 120,096 $ 115,448 Work-in-process 7,494 7,626 Finished goods 53,816 60,146 Inventory $ 181,406 $ 183,220 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $ 2.5 million and $ 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and $ 6.6 million and $ 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. 13 6.

Am ortization expense is included in the amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 359,000 for the three months ending December 31, 2023, $ 1.4 million for each of the next three fiscal years (2024 - 2026), $ 1.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2027 and $ 1.3 million in total thereafter. 8. OTHER ASSETS: Other assets consist of the following (in thousands): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Long-term taxes receivable $ 57,581 $ 63,915 Right-of-use assets 25,321 31,486 Long-term contract assets 16,317 11,651 Other long-term assets 2,228 2,687 Other assets $ 101,447 $ 109,739 See Notes 9 and 20 for further explanation on right-of-use assets and long-term taxes receivable, respectively. 9. LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not 15 contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of September 30, 2023, the Company did not have any finance leases and had one additional operating lease that has not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Operating lease cost $ 1,094 $ 1,067 $ 3,538 $ 3,238 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ — $ 867 $ — $ 867 The following table presents the Company’s operating right-of-use assets and liabilities (in thousands): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Right-of-use assets $ 25,321 $ 31,486 Short-term lease liabilities 3,376 3,737 Long-term lease liabilities 23,380 29,039 The decrease in right-of-use assets and long-term lease liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the purchases of two facilities, which were previously accounted for as operating lease obligations. The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: September 30, 2023 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.1 Weighted average discount rate 3.7 % As of September 30, 2023 , current operating leases had remaining terms between two months and eight years with options to extend the lease terms. Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2023, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2023 (1) $ 1,040 2024 4,119 2025 4,155 2026 4,235 2027 4,317 Thereafter 12,077 Total lease payments 29,943 Less: Imputed interest ( 3,187 ) Present value of lease payments $ 26,756 16 10. ACCRUED EXPENSES: Accrued expenses consist of the following (in thousands): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Compensation $ 22,685 $ 31,751 PPG Industries, Inc. agreement 6,090 9,864 Consulting 1,832 910 Professional fees 1,049 906 Research and development agreements 513 662 Royalties 414 877 Other 5,917 6,032 Accrued expenses $ 38,500 $ 51,002 11. RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH ACADEMIC PARTNERS: The Company has long-standing relationships with a number of academic institutions that undertake funded research projects, including Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC). Under the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the universities have granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by the universities for the Company. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 60,000 and $ 261,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and $ 358,000 and $ 596,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company also makes payments under the current research agreement with USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of September 30, 2023 , the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 2.4 million for work to be performed during the remaining term of the research agreement. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the agreement of $ 251,000 and $ 245,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and $ 666,000 and $ 695,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. 12. OTHER LIABILITIES: Other liabilities consist of the following (in thousands): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Long-term lease liabilities $ 23,380 $ 29,039 Long-term taxes payable 15,749 14,592 Other long-term liabilities 54 54 Other liabilities $ 39,183 $ 43,685 See Notes 9 and 20 for further explanation on long-term lease liabilities and long-term taxes payable, respectively. 13. EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENT: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which, effective as of October 1, 2011, replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement, by amendment in February 2021, runs through December 31, 2024, and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The 17 actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares have been issued for services rendered by PPG since the inception of the contract. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. In February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to UDC Ireland, at the Company’s manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by UDC Ireland’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OMM, for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements have been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 1.5 million and $ 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and $ 6.1 million and $ 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 14. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $ 7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote . The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of September 30, 2023 , the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of September 30, 2023 , the Company had issued 48,720,530 shares of common stock, of which 47,354,882 were outstanding. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company repurchased no shares of common stock. Dividends During the three months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.35 per common share, or $ 16.7 million, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 1.05 per common share, or $ 50.1 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On October 31, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $ 0.35 per share to be paid on December 29, 2023 to all shareholders of record of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on December 15, 2023 . All future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. 18 15.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan On June 15, 2023, the shareholders of the Company voted to approve the Universal Display Corporation 2023 Equity Compensation Plan (the “Equity Compensation Plan”), which replaced the Universal Display Corporation 2014 Equity Compensation Plan. The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Company’s Human Capital Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. The total number of shares that may be subject to awards under the Equity Compensation Plan is equal to the shares that were available for issuance and not subject to an award under the 2014 Equity Compensation Plan at the time it was replaced by the Equity Compensation Plan, subject to adjustment with respect to shares underlying any outstanding award granted under the Equity Compensation Plan or the 2014 Equity Compensation Plan that may expire, or be terminated, surrendered or forfeited for any reason, without issuance of such shares. As of September 30, 2023 , there were 1,520,274 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. The Equity Compensation Plan will terminate on June 15, 2033. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to five years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. 19 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company granted 110,279 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 16.4 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 2.4 million and $ 3.4 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.4 million and $ 1.5 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 454,000 and $ 573,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 7.8 million and $ 10.8 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 4.4 million and $ 4.6 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 1.4 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , 3,190 and 2,852 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 465,000 and $ 305,000 , respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , 51,154 and 54,252 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 7.1 million and $ 8.3 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 60,000 and $ 32,000 , respectively. Such compensation charges to research and development expense were $ 188,000 and $ 183,000 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 363,000 and $ 315,000 , respectively. Such compensation charges to selling, general and administrative expense were $ 1.1 million and $ 937,000 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 . In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 9,712 and 6,588 shares, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's achievement of specified financial metrics such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), cash flow, and/or gross margin, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a three-year performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is three times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's performance falls below certain thresholds, the performance units will not vest at all. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company granted 84,448 performance units, of which 42,222 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on three-year cumulative adjusted EBITDA, 21,113 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on three-year cumulative gross margin and 21,113 units are subject to market-based, TSR vesting requirements. The grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte Carlo simulation model used for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.5 million and $ 1.9 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 607,000 and $ 488,000 , respectively, and cost of sales expense of $ 376,000 and $ 303,000 , respectively, related to the performance units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.7 million and $ 3.7 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 982,000 and $ 873,000 , respectively, and cost of sales expense of $ 609,000 and $ 539,000 , respectively, related to the performance units. 20 In connection with the vesting of performance units during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , 5,350 and 5,082 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 775,000 and $ 826,000 , respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company issued 13,915 and 13,026 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 1.5 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded charges of $ 36,000 and $ 3,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 61,000 and $ 19,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 46,000 and $ 14,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 the Company recorded charges of $ 105,000 and $ 86,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 186,000 and $ 183,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 121,000 and $ 110,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company granted a total of 2,366 and 2,024 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The fair value of shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both nine-month periods. 17. RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFIT LIABILITY: On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of September 30, 2023 , there were eight participants in the SERP. In December 2022, one of the participants retired and monthly SERP benefit payments commenced in January 2023. The total SERP benefit payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $ 1.5 million. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. 21 The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Service cost $ 238 $ 282 $ 713 $ 1,005 Interest cost 725 346 2,174 1,038 Amortization of prior service cost 203 280 611 839 Amortization of loss 120 372 360 1,116 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,286 $ 1,280 $ 3,858 $ 3,998 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the current research agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by it under that agreement, and by the University of Michigan (Michigan) under a subcontractor agreement that Michigan has with USC. Under the terms of the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the Company makes royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 11 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with five executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 13) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 26.2 million and $ 31.9 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. 22 19. CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended September 30, % of Total Revenue for the Nine Months Ended September 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2023 2022 2023 2022 September 30, 2023 A 45 % 46 % 37 % 42 % $ 12,525 B 20 % 23 % 23 % 26 % $ 32,879 C 12 % 12 % 15 % 14 % $ 43,314 D 8 % 4 % 10 % 4 % $ 20,442 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 98 % and 97 % for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and 98 % and 97 % for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Country 2023 2022 2023 2022 South Korea $ 87,231 $ 100,555 $ 235,320 $ 269,338 China 48,687 52,906 163,634 159,486 Japan 2,019 2,011 5,175 4,456 Other non-U.S. locations 541 976 3,856 1,991 Total non-U.S. locations 138,478 156,448 407,985 435,271 United States 2,599 4,108 10,124 12,316 Total revenue $ 141,077 $ 160,556 $ 418,109 $ 447,587 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer.

See Note 13 for further explanation. 20. INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 4.4 % and 23.7 % for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively and 16.8 % and 22.7 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. The discrepancy between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is primarily due to nondeductible employee compensation and U.S. international tax (GILTI and Subpart F). The reduction in the income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, was primarily due to the change in IRS regulations, issued in July 2023, that permit withholding taxes to be credited against U.S. taxable income for the tax years 2022 and 2023, recorded as a discrete tax adjustment in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 2.4 million and $ 16.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and $ 28.5 million and $ 42.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. Included in other current assets as of September 30, 2023 is $ 18.0 million of income tax receivable, which was previously classified as a deferred tax asset. This was the result of a change in guidance issued under IRS Notice 2023-63 which clarified that certain research and development costs do not need to be capitalized and amortized over future periods. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is not sufficient evidence to release the valuation allowance that has been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit and unrealized loss on investments, and no indicators against the realizability of the remaining net deferred tax asset. 23 The U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) for the years ended December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2017 was closed in September 2022, resulting in a refund of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld. In July 2023, the Company amended its U.S. federal tax returns to reflect the refund and to redetermine the foreign tax credit amount. In November 2022, the Company prepaid $ 18.8 million to the IRS under Rev. Proc. 2005-18 to offset the tax payable amount. On December 27, 2018, regarding the withholding taxes for the years 2018 to 2022, the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are considered Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Based on the Korean Supreme Court decision, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for the entire period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. The Company received a formal rejection from the KNTS and has filed a petition to the Korean Tax Tribunal to reverse the decision of the tax office. The Company has been advised by a prominent Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 57.6 million and $ 60.9 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company also recorded foreign exchange loss of $ 1.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and $ 3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the fluctuation of the Korean Won to the U.S. Dollar and resulting remeasurement of this Won-denominated receivable. The Company will also amend U.S. federal tax returns for the 2018 to 2020 years when the anticipated refund from KNTS is received to offset the additional tax liability and to redetermine the research and development credit utilization. In November 2022, the Company prepaid $ 16.0 million to the IRS under Rev. Proc. 2005-18 that relates to the anticipated tax payable. The Company has recorded a long-term liability of $ 15.7 million and $ 14.6 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, for the estimated amounts due to the U.S. federal government based on the amendment of the Company's U.S. tax returns indicating that lower withholding amounts were required. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2018 to 2021 are open and subject to examination. The Company's state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. 21. REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded 98 % and 97 %, respectively, of its revenue from OLED related sales and 2 % and 3 %, respectively, from the providing of services through Adesis. For both nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded 97 % of its revenue from OLED related sales and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of September 30, 2023 Accounts receivable $ 122,192 Short-term unbilled receivables 21,896 Short-term contract assets 2,585 Long-term unbilled receivables 6,379 Long-term contract assets 9,938 Short-term deferred revenue 66,828 Long-term deferred revenue 8,859 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables and contract assets are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2023 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of September 30, 2023 , the Company had $ 30.5 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. 24 Significant changes in the assets and liabilities balances associated with the Company's contracts from customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Assets Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 38,457 $ ( 63,878 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 143,064 Increases due to cash received — ( 159,989 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 5,116 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 29,094 — Contract assets recorded, net ( 1,860 ) — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 24,893 ) — Net change 2,341 ( 11,809 ) Balance at September 30, 2023 $ 40,798 $ ( 75,687 ) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Assets Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 8,127 $ ( 157,081 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 178,737 Increases due to cash received — ( 132,961 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 17,290 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 5,502 — Net change 5,502 63,066 Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 13,629 $ ( 94,015 ) The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was $ 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $ 17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 . These adjustments resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of the Company's customers over the remaining lives of their contracts, resulting from changes in global macroeconomic factors. 22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units, performance units and the impact of shares to be issued under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 25 The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Numerator: Net income $ 51,516 $ 53,455 $ 141,033 $ 144,927 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 243 ) ( 289 ) ( 709 ) ( 849 ) Adjusted net income $ 51,273 $ 53,166 $ 140,324 $ 144,078 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,570,099 47,396,495 47,555,734 47,386,426 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from ESPP 499 729 1,764 1,814 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 61,833 69,710 52,194 67,653 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,632,431 47,466,934 47,609,692 47,455,893 Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.08 $ 1.12 $ 2.95 $ 3.04 Diluted $ 1.08 $ 1.12 $ 2.95 $ 3.04 For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards of 39,426 and 173,707 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards of 34,291 and 121,962 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 26 ITEM 2.

OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. On December 2, 2022, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement 27 term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial patent license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of red and green phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), which has operations in New Castle and Wilmington, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of September 30, 2023, Adesis employed a team of 138 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of September 30, 2023, OVJP Corp employed a team of 28 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation 28 of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. We purchased the site during September 2023. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. The first phase of facility improvements has been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 92,492 $ 84,182 $ 8,310 Royalty and license fees 45,915 71,450 (25,535 ) Contract research services 2,670 4,924 (2,254 ) Total revenue 141,077 160,556 (19,479 ) COST OF SALES 34,248 37,396 (3,148 ) Gross margin 106,829 123,160 (16,331 ) OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 33,099 30,414 2,685 Selling, general and administrative 18,084 18,442 (358 ) Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 4,557 3,562 995 Patent costs 2,572 2,018 554 Royalty and license expense 81 261 (180 ) Total operating expenses 58,393 54,697 3,696 OPERATING INCOME 48,436 68,463 (20,027 ) Interest income, net 7,136 2,432 4,704 Other loss, net (1,693 ) (804 ) (889 ) Interest and other income, net 5,443 1,628 3,815 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 53,879 70,091 (16,212 ) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (2,363 ) (16,636 ) 14,273 NET INCOME $ 51,516 $ 53,455 $ (1,939 ) Revenue Our total material sales were $92.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $84.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 10% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 3%. The increase in material sales was due to strengthened demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material, as well as improved product mix weighted towards increased demand for our new generation of emitter products. 29 Revenue from royalty and license fees was $45.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $71.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of 36%. The decrease in royalty and license fees was primarily the result of changes in customer mix, the decrease in the cumulative catch-up noted below, as well as higher estimated future demand for several of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts. The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was a decrease of $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This adjustment resulted from a decrease in the average selling price per gram that was primarily due to the increase in anticipated OLED materials demand by several of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts, resulting from changes in global macroeconomic factors. The cumulative catch-up adjustment during the three months ended September 30, 2022 was a net increase of $6.6 million, resulting in a net reduction in revenue between periods of $8.1 million related to cumulative catch-ups. Contract research services revenue was $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of 46%. The decrease in contract research services revenue was primarily due to the timing of the completion of several CRO projects by our subsidiary, Adesis. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by $3.1 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to a reduction in contract manufacturing support costs, a reduction in the underutilization charges of the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and changes in product mix, offset by an increase in the level of material sales and inventory reserve. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the increase in inventory reserve was $2.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the decrease in revenue from royalty and license fees offset by the increase in material sales, gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by $16.3 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 76% from 77%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $33.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $30.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including employee-related compensation expenses and contract research costs, offset by lower costs associated with PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $18.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $18.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due to the Fujifilm patents becoming fully amortized during July 2022, partially offset by the commencement of amortization expense associated with the Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA) patent acquisition that was completed on April 28, 2023. Patent costs 30 Patent costs increased to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The results in the current quarter reflected higher internal prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $81,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $261,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Interest and other loss, net Interest income, net was $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022 as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other loss, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $804,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 4.4% and 23.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $2.4 million and $16.6 million, respectively, for those periods. The reduction in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the change in IRS regulations, issued in July 2023, that permit withholding taxes to be credited against U.S. taxable income for the tax years 2022 and 2023, by applying federal regulations in place prior to changes in 2022. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 239,789 $ 242,742 $ (2,953 ) Royalty and license fees 165,524 191,530 (26,006 ) Contract research services 12,796 13,315 (519 ) Total revenue 418,109 447,587 (29,478 ) COST OF SALES 99,357 97,798 1,559 Gross margin 318,752 349,789 (31,037 ) OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 96,840 85,156 11,684 Selling, general and administrative 50,557 59,373 (8,816 ) Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 11,442 14,562 (3,120 ) Patent costs 7,056 6,075 981 Royalty and license expense 414 596 (182 ) Total operating expenses 166,309 165,762 547 OPERATING INCOME 152,443 184,027 (31,584 ) Interest income, net 20,301 4,306 15,995 Other loss, net (3,180 ) (749 ) (2,431 ) Interest and other income, net 17,121 3,557 13,564 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 169,564 187,584 (18,020 ) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (28,531 ) (42,657 ) 14,126 NET INCOME $ 141,033 $ 144,927 $ (3,894 ) Revenue Our total material sales were $239.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $242.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of 1% with a decrease in unit material volume of 3%. The decline in material sales was primarily due to reduced demand for our emitter material during the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by the introduction of blue emitter and host sales. This weakness resulted from the continuation of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions that have negatively impacted the OLED display market segment. 31 Revenue from royalty and license fees was $165.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $191.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in royalty and license fees was primarily the result of higher estimated future demand for several of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts, as well as the impact of the cumulative catch-up adjustments noted below. The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was an increase of $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to an increase of $17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, resulting in a net reduction in revenue between periods of $12.2 million, the majority of which was recorded to royalty and license fees. These adjustments resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated OLED materials demand by several of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts. Contract research services revenue was $12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of 4%. The decrease in contract research services revenue was primarily due to the timing of the completion of several CRO projects by our subsidiary, Adesis, in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $1.6 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to underutilization of the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and changes in product mix offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs and a decrease in the level of material sales. The underutilization charges related to the Shannon facility were $10.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Shannon facility costs began to be recorded as cost of sales in June 2022 when the facility was first used for production activities. Shannon facility costs prior to June 2022 were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in the cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was an increase in inventory reserve of $6.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the decrease in revenue from royalty and licenses fees and material sales, gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by $31.0 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 76% from 78%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $96.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $85.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased contract research costs, employee-related compensation expenses and those costs associated with PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $50.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $59.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expenses and a decrease in pre-production costs associated with the Shannon facility. The Shannon facility became operational during June 2022 and the costs associated with this facility have since been included in cost of sales. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was due to the Fujifilm patents becoming 32 fully amortized during July 2022 offset by the commencement of amortization expense associated with the Merck KGaA patent acquisition that was completed on April 28, 2023. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The results in the current year reflected higher internal prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $414,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $596,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Interest and other loss, net Interest income, net was $20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other loss, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $749,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 16.8% and 22.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $28.5 million and $42.7 million, respectively, for those periods. The reduction in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the change in IRS regulations, issued in July 2023, that permit withholding taxes to be credited against U.S. taxable income for the tax years 2022 and 2023, by applying federal regulations in place prior to changes in 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $79.3 million, short-term investments of $412.4 million, and long-term corporate bonds and U.S. Government bonds investments of $287.1 million for a total of $778.8 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $93.4 million, short-term investments of $484.3 million, and long-term U.S. Government bonds investments of $247.9 million for a total of $825.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $117.7 million resulting from $141.0 million of net income and $50.7 million from non-cash items including depreciation, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, partially offset by $74.0 million reduction due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in accounts receivable of $29.5 million, an increase in other assets of $29.4 million, a decrease in other liabilities of $28.7 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expense of $32,000, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $11.8 million and a decrease in inventory of $1.8 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $124.2 million resulting from $144.9 million of net income and $129.6 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $150.3 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $133.0 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $29.5 million, an increase in other liabilities of $9.6 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.2 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $48.4 million and an increase in other assets of $1.3 million. Cash used in investing activities was $75.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $197.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales and maturities of $43.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to net purchases of $161.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles of $82.9 million. The increase in property, plant and equipment and intangibles during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the Merck KGaA patent acquisition and the purchases of the Shannon facility and the Korean application center. 33 Cash used in financing activities was $56.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $50.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $7.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $1.3 million and an increase in the proceeds from issuance of common stock of $285,000. Working capital was $747.4 million as of September 30, 2023, as compared to $763.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in short-term investments and an increase in deferred revenue, partially offset by an increase in other current assets, an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in other current liabilities. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. 34 Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHE R INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of our goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and our patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. ITEM 1A.

UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light and can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, monitor, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize the Company’s proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 6,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting and contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of June 30, 2023 and results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 . The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (UDC Korea), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 7 Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation Certain prior year adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities have been reclassified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform to the current year presentation. These adjustments have been consolidated into their respective operating assets and liabilities accounts, specifically, inventory, other current assets, other assets and deferred revenue. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment in the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. The impairment in the value of minority equity investments is included in the other (loss) income, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included 8 in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, they are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the sales-based portion of royalty revenue based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or predetermined rates on a contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. On December 2, 2022, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase red and green phosphorescent emitter materials from the Company for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This amount purchased is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. 9 In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the lives of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the facilities of the Company's manufacturing partner, PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) and at the Company's internal facilities. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA), BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm Corporation ( Fujifilm). The Merck KGaA acquisition was completed on April 28, 2023. The BASF and Fujifilm acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over 10 a period of 10 years for the Merck KGaA and BASF patents. The Fujifilm acquired technology was fully amortized over a period of 10 years that ended in July 2022. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland and UDC Korea subsidiaries are also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its respective local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 % . Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved, and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . Under this standard, a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring the security's fair value. The standard also requires certain disclosures for equity securities that are subject to contractual restrictions. ASU 2022-03 becomes effective January 1, 2024, and the Company is evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its investments. 11 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of marketable fixed income securities consists of U.S. Government bonds and corporate bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method.

EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENT: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which, effective as of October 1, 2011, replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement, by amendment in February 2021, runs through December 31, 2024, and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares have been issued for services rendered by PPG since the inception of the contract. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. In February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to UDC Ireland, at the Company’s manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by UDC Ireland’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OMM, for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements have been completed and operations commenced in 17 June 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 2.6 million and $ 796,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and $ 4.6 million and $ 2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 14. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $ 7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote . The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of June 30, 2023 , the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of June 30, 2023 , the Company had issued 48,706,932 shares of common stock, of which 47,341,284 were outstanding.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan On June 15, 2023, the shareholders of the Company voted to approve the Universal Display Corporation 2023 Equity Compensation Plan (the “Equity Compensation Plan”), which replaced the Universal Display Corporation 2014 Equity Compensation Plan. The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Company’s Human Capital Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. The total number of shares that may be subject to awards under the Equity Compensation Plan is equal to the shares that were available for issuance and not subject to an award under the 2014 Equity Compensation Plan at the time it was replaced by the Equity Compensation Plan, subject to adjustment with respect to shares underlying any outstanding award granted under the Equity Compensation Plan or the 2014 Equity Compensation Plan that may expire, or be terminated, surrendered or forfeited for any reason, without issuance of such shares. As of June 30, 2023 , there were 1,521,419 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. The Equity Compensation Plan will terminate on June 15, 2033. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to five years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 , the Company granted 108,706 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 16.1 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 2.4 million and $ 3.4 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.4 million and $ 1.6 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 451,000 and $ 567,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 5.4 million and $ 7.4 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 2.9 million and $ 3.1 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 981,000 and $ 1.1 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , 1,611 and 1,616 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 217,000 and $ 210,000 , respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , 47,964 and 51,400 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 6.6 million and $ 8.0 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 19 For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 60,000 and $ 31,000 , respectively. Such compensation charges to research and development expense were $ 127,000 and $ 151,000 , respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 359,000 and $ 313,000 , respectively. Such compensation charges to selling, general and administrative expense were $ 714,000 and $ 622,000 , respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 3,304 and 2,196 shares, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's achievement of specified financial metrics such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), cash flow, and/or gross margin, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a three-year performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is three times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's performance falls below certain thresholds, the performance units will not vest at all. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 , the Company granted 84,448 performance units, of which 42,222 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on three-year cumulative adjusted EBITDA, 21,113 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on three-year cumulative gross margin and 21,113 units are subject to market-based, TSR vesting requirements. The grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 12.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte Carlo simulation model used for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 607,000 and $ 413,000 , respectively, and cost of sales expense of $ 376,000 and $ 256,000 , respectively, related to the performance units.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. 20 During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company issued 9,339 and 8,042 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 971,000 and $ 847,000 , respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded charges of $ 30,000 and $ 60,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 54,000 and $ 113,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 34,000 and $ 66,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 the Company recorded charges of $ 70,000 and $ 85,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 125,000 and $ 164,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 75,000 and $ 95,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company granted a total of 2,366 and 2,024 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The fair value of shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both six-month periods. 17. RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFIT LIABILITY: On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of June 30, 2023 , there were eight participants in the SERP. In December 2022, one of the participants retired and monthly SERP benefit payments commenced in January 2023. The total SERP benefit payments for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $ 1.2 million. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Service cost $ 237 $ 362 $ 475 $ 723 Interest cost 725 346 1,449 692 Amortization of prior service cost 204 279 408 559 Amortization of loss 120 372 240 744 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,286 $ 1,359 $ 2,572 $ 2,718 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the current research agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by it under that agreement, and by the University of Michigan (Michigan) under a subcontractor agreement that Michigan has with USC. Under the terms of the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the Company makes royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 11 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with five executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. 21 In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 13) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 27.6 million and $ 31.9 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. 19. CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended June 30, % of Total Revenue for the Six Months Ended June 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2023 2022 2023 2022 June 30, 2023 A 36 % 39 % 33 % 39 % $ 10,776 B 22 % 30 % 24 % 29 % $ 35,184 C 14 % 6 % 11 % 4 % $ 21,104 D 13 % 14 % 17 % 15 % $ 22,518 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 98 % and 97 % for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and 97 % for both six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Country 2023 2022 2023 2022 South Korea $ 82,029 $ 79,096 $ 148,089 $ 168,783 China 57,520 51,180 114,947 106,580 Japan 1,509 1,392 3,156 2,445 Other non-U.S. locations 1,978 715 3,315 1,015 Total non-U.S. locations 143,036 132,383 269,507 278,823 United States 3,529 4,178 7,525 8,208 Total revenue $ 146,565 $ 136,561 $ 277,032 $ 287,031 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 United States $ 117,196 $ 117,255 Ireland 25,894 20,270 Other 14,476 5,920 Total long-lived assets $ 157,566 $ 143,445 22 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 13 for further explanation. 20. INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 22.4 % and 24.5 % for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively and 22.6 % and 22.1 % for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. The discrepancy between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is primarily due to nondeductible employee compensation, U.S. international tax (GILTI and Subpart F) and non-creditable Chinese withholding tax, partially offset by the benefit of income taxed in foreign jurisdictions. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 14.4 million and $ 13.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, and $ 26.2 million and $ 26.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is not sufficient evidence to release the valuation allowance that has been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit and unrealized loss on investments, and no indicators against the realizability of the remaining net deferred tax asset. The U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) for the years ended December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2017 was closed in September 2022, resulting in a refund of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld. In July 2023, the Company amended its U.S. federal tax returns to reflect the refund and to redetermine the foreign tax credit amount. In November 2022, the Company prepaid $ 18.8 million to the IRS under Rev. Proc. 2005-18 to offset the tax payable amount. On December 27, 2018, regarding the withholding taxes for the years 2018 to 2022, the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are considered Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Based on the Korean Supreme Court decision, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for the entire period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. The Company received a formal rejection from the KNTS and has filed a petition to the Korean Tax Tribunal to reverse the decision of the tax office. The Company has been advised by a prominent Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 59.1 million and $ 60.9 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company also recorded foreign exchange loss of $ 803,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $ 1.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 due to the fluctuation of the Korean Won to the U.S. Dollar and resulting remeasurement of this Won-denominated receivable. The Company will also amend U.S. federal tax returns for the 2018 to 2020 years when the anticipated refund from KNTS is received to offset the additional tax liability and to redetermine the research and development credit utilization. In November 2022, the Company prepaid $ 16.0 million to the IRS under Rev. Proc. 2005-18 that relates to the anticipated tax payable. The Company has recorded a long-term liability of $ 15.0 million and $ 14.6 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, for the estimated amounts due to the U.S. federal government based on the amendment of the Company's U.S. tax returns indicating that lower withholding amounts were required. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2018 to 2021 are open and subject to examination. The Company's state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. 21. REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. 23 For both the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded 97 % of its revenue from OLED related sales and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded 96 % and 97 %, respectively, of its revenue from OLED related sales and 4 % and 3 %, respectively, from the providing of services through Adesis. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of June 30, 2023 Accounts receivable $ 109,390 Short-term unbilled receivables 13,263 Short-term contract assets 2,585 Long-term unbilled receivables 232 Long-term contract assets 10,729 Short-term deferred revenue 29,732 Long-term deferred revenue 18,410 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables and contract assets are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2023 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of June 30, 2023 , the Company had $ 23.9 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the assets and liabilities balances associated with the Company's contracts from customers for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Assets Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 38,457 $ ( 63,878 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 100,242 Increases due to cash received — ( 91,111 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 6,605 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 9,404 — Contract assets recorded, net ( 1,069 ) — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 19,983 ) — Net change ( 11,648 ) 15,736 Balance at June 30, 2023 $ 26,809 $ ( 48,142 ) Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Assets Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 8,127 $ ( 157,081 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 110,258 Increases due to cash received — ( 92,976 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 10,672 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 4,266 — Net change 4,266 27,954 Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 12,393 $ ( 129,127 ) The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was $ 6.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $ 10.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 . These adjustments resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of the Company's customers over the remaining lives of their contracts, resulting from changes in global macroeconomic factors. 24 22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including restricted stock units, performance units and the impact of shares to be issued under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Numerator: Net income $ 49,678 $ 41,502 $ 89,517 $ 91,472 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 250 ) ( 235 ) ( 465 ) ( 557 ) Adjusted net income $ 49,428 $ 41,267 $ 89,052 $ 90,915 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,572,971 47,393,830 47,548,404 47,381,864 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from ESPP 325 894 1,265 1,085 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 44,819 63,168 43,988 68,405 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,618,115 47,457,892 47,593,657 47,451,354 Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.04 $ 0.87 $ 1.87 $ 1.92 Diluted $ 1.04 $ 0.87 $ 1.87 $ 1.92 For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards of 75,251 and 173,707 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards of 31,578 and 57,508 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 25 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions.

As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the sections entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by disclosures in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. On December 2, 2022, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement 26 term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial patent license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of red and green phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), which has operations in New Castle and Wilmington, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of June 30, 2023, Adesis employed a team of 137 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of June 30, 2023, OVJP Corp employed a team of 26 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation 27 of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. We currently lease the Shannon site and have a contractual option to purchase the facility. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. The first phase of facility improvements has been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 77,107 $ 71,869 $ 5,238 Royalty and license fees 64,399 60,278 4,121 Contract research services 5,059 4,414 645 Total revenue 146,565 136,561 10,004 COST OF SALES 32,139 27,239 4,900 Gross margin 114,426 109,322 5,104 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 32,318 28,197 4,121 Selling, general and administrative 17,077 19,869 (2,792 ) Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 3,994 5,502 (1,508 ) Patent costs 2,229 2,259 (30 ) Royalty and license expense 169 181 (12 ) Total operating expenses 55,787 56,008 (221 ) OPERATING INCOME 58,639 53,314 5,325 Interest income, net 6,198 1,583 4,615 Other (loss) income, net (784 ) 89 (873 ) Interest and other income, net 5,414 1,672 3,742 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 64,053 54,986 9,067 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (14,375 ) (13,484 ) (891 ) NET INCOME $ 49,678 $ 41,502 $ 8,176 Revenue Our total material sales were $77.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $71.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 7% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 9%. The increase in material sales was due to strengthened demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material. 28 Revenue from royalty and license fees was $64.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $60.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 7%. The increase in royalty and license fees was primarily the result of higher unit material volume. The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net for three months ended June 30, 2023 was $922,000 compared to $8.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. These adjustments were primarily due to an increase in the average contract royalty and license fee per gram assessed to our customers as measured under ASC 606 as a result of a reduction in the forecasted sales volume anticipated over the remaining lives of their respective contracts. Contract research services revenue was $5.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $4.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 15%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2023 increased by $4.9 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales, an increase in manufacturing costs, underutilization of the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and higher per unit material costs. The underutilization charges related to the Shannon facility were $3.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Shannon facility costs began to be recorded as cost of sales in June 2022 when the facility was first used for production activities. Shannon facility costs prior to June 2022 were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that the Shannon facility will continue to be underutilized in the near-term as we have begun to bring this additional capacity online in preparation for anticipated growth in the years ahead. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was an increase in inventory reserve of $781,000 and $604,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees offset by Shannon costs, gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2023 increased by $5.1 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 78% from 80%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $32.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $28.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased contract research costs and those costs associated with PPG development activity, and employee-related compensation expenses. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $17.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $19.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expenses as a result of current assumptions of future vesting for performance-based awards and a decrease in pre-production costs associated with the Shannon facility. The Shannon facility became operational during June 2022 and the costs associated with this facility have since been included in cost of sales. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was due to the Fujifilm patents becoming fully amortized during July 2022, partially offset by the commencement of amortization expense associated with the Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA) patent acquisition that was completed on April 28, 2023. Patent costs 29 Patent costs decreased to $2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $169,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $181,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $6.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other (loss) income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $784,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to other income, net of $89,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 22.4% and 24.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $14.4 million and $13.5 million, respectively, for those periods. Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 147,297 $ 158,560 $ (11,263 ) Royalty and license fees 119,609 120,080 (471 ) Contract research services 10,126 8,391 1,735 Total revenue 277,032 287,031 (9,999 ) COST OF SALES 65,109 60,402 4,707 Gross margin 211,923 226,629 (14,706 ) OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 63,741 54,742 8,999 Selling, general and administrative 32,473 40,931 (8,458 ) Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 6,885 11,000 (4,115 ) Patent costs 4,484 4,057 427 Royalty and license expense 333 335 (2 ) Total operating expenses 107,916 111,065 (3,149 ) OPERATING INCOME 104,007 115,564 (11,557 ) Interest income, net 13,165 1,874 11,291 Other (loss) income, net (1,487 ) 55 (1,542 ) Interest and other income, net 11,678 1,929 9,749 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 115,685 117,493 (1,808 ) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (26,168 ) (26,021 ) (147 ) NET INCOME $ 89,517 $ 91,472 $ (1,955 ) Revenue Our total material sales were $147.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $158.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of 7% with a commensurate decrease in unit material volume of 6%. The decline in material sales was primarily due to reduced demand for our emitter material during the first quarter of 2023. This weakness resulted from the continuation of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions that have negatively impacted the OLED display market segment. We believe the decline is temporary and that the duration is dependent upon the timing of the recovery of the global market conditions, which continues to be uncertain. 30 Revenue from royalty and license fees was $119.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $120.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was $6.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $10.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. These adjustments resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts. Contract research services revenue was $10.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $8.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 21%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2023 increased by $4.7 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to underutilization of the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and higher per unit material costs offset by a decrease in the level of material sales. The underutilization charges related to the Shannon facility were $8.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Shannon facility costs began to be recorded as cost of sales in June 2022 when the facility was first used for production activities. Shannon facility costs prior to June 2022 were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that the Shannon facility will continue to be underutilized in the near-term as we have begun to bring this additional capacity online in preparation for anticipated growth in the years ahead. Included in the cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was an increase in inventory reserve of $4.1 million and $688,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the decrease in revenue from material sales as well as the Shannon costs and inventory reserve, gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2023 decreased by $14.7 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 76% from 79%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $63.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $54.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased contract research costs and those costs associated with PPG development activity, and employee-related compensation expenses. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $32.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $40.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expenses as a result of current assumptions of future vesting for performance-based awards and a decrease in pre-production costs associated with the Shannon facility. The Shannon facility became operational during June 2022 and the costs associated with this facility have since been included in cost of sales. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $6.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $11.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was due to the Fujifilm patents becoming fully amortized during July 2022 offset by the commencement of amortization expense associated with the Merck KGaA patent acquisition that was completed on April 28, 2023. Patent costs 31 Patent costs increased to $4.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $4.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The results in the current year reflected higher internal prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $333,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $335,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $13.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2022 as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other (loss) income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to other income, net of $55,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 22.6% and 22.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $26.2 million and $26.0 million, respectively, for those periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $93.5 million, short-term investments of $465.7 million, and long-term corporate bonds and U.S. Government bonds investments of $197.3 million for a total of $756.5 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $93.4 million, short-term investments of $484.3 million, and long-term U.S. Government bonds investments of $247.9 million for a total of $825.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $57.4 million resulting from $89.5 million of net income and $13.2 million from non-cash items including depreciation, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, partially offset by $45.3 million reduction due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to a decrease in other liabilities of $22.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $17.7 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $16.7 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $15.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in other assets of $19.7 million and a decrease in inventory of $7.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $86.1 million resulting from $91.5 million of net income and $82.1 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $87.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $93.0 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $32.7 million and an increase in other liabilities of $1.3 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $32.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.2 million and an increase in other assets of $5.5 million. Cash used in investing activities was $17.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $147.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales and maturities of $75.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to net purchases of $126.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles of $72.0 million. The increase in property, plant and equipment and intangibles during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to the Merck KGaA patent acquisition. 32 Cash used in financing activities was $39.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to $36.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $4.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $1.4 million and an increase in the proceeds from issuance of common stock of $124,000. Working capital was $797.4 million as of June 30, 2023, as compared to $763.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in other current liabilities, an increase in accounts receivable and decreases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 30, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. 33 Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHE R INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of our goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and our patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. ITEM 1A.

(UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light and can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, monitor, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize the Company’s proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting and contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2023 and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 . The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (UDC Korea), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 6 Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation Certain prior year adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities have been reclassified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to conform to the current year presentation. These adjustments have been consolidated into their respective operating assets and liabilities accounts, specifically, inventory, other current assets, other assets and deferred revenue. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. The impairment in the value of minority equity investments is included in the other loss, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included 7 in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, they are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the sales-based portion of royalty revenue based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or predetermined rates on a contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. On December 2, 2022, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase red and green phosphorescent emitter materials from the Company for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This amount purchased is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. 8 In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the lives of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partner's, and at the Company's internal, manufacturing processing facilities. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for the BASF patents. The Fujifilm acquired technology was fully amortized over a period of 10 years that ended in July 2022. 9 Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland and UDC Korea subsidiaries are also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 % . Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved, and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . Under this standard, a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring the security's fair value. The standard also requires certain disclosures for equity securities that are subject to contractual restrictions. ASU 2022-03 becomes effective January 1, 2024, and the Company is evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its investments. 10 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of marketable fixed income securities consists of U.S. Government bonds and corporate bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method.

Minority investments are included in investments on the 11 Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2023 , the Company had minority investments in five entities with a total carrying value of $ 14.0 million accounted for as equity securities without readily determinable fair values, as compared to four minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 12.0 million as of December 31, 2022. 4.

Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other loss, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of March 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022 . 5.

BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of € 86.8 million ($ 95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $ 217,000 as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years . 13 Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $ 16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $ 10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $ 4.8 million to internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $ 1.5 million to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years.

LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of March 31, 2023, the Company did not have any finance leases and had one additional operating lease that has not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Operating lease cost $ 1,221 $ 1,098 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ — $ — 14 The following table presents the Company’s operating right-of-use assets and liabilities (in thousands): March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Right-of-use assets $ 30,567 $ 31,486 Short-term lease liabilities 3,811 3,737 Long-term lease liabilities 28,154 29,039 The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: March 31, 2023 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.5 Weighted average discount rate 3.4 % As of March 31, 2023 , current operating leases had remaining terms between one and nine years with options to extend the lease terms.

RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH ACADEMIC PARTNERS: The Company has long-standing relationships with a number of academic institutions that undertake funded research projects, including Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC). Under the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the universities have granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by the universities for the Company. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 159,000 and $ 154,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 15 The Company also makes payments under the current research agreement with USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of March 31, 2023, the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 1.7 million for work to be performed during the remaining term of the research agreement. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the agreement of $ 282,000 and $ 195,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. 12. OTHER LIABILITIES: Other liabilities consist of the following (in thousands): March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Long-term lease liabilities $ 28,154 $ 29,039 Long-term taxes payable 14,991 14,592 Other long-term liabilities 54 54 Other liabilities $ 43,199 $ 43,685 See Notes 9 and 20 for further explanation on long-term lease liabilities and long-term taxes payable, respectively. 13. EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENT: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which, effective as of October 1, 2011, replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement, by amendment in February 2021, runs through December 31, 2024, and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares have been issued for services rendered by PPG since the inception of the contract. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. In February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to UDC Ireland, at the Company’s new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by UDC Ireland’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OMM, for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements have been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 2.0 million and $ 1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 14. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. 16 In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $ 7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote . The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of March 31, 2023 , the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of March 31, 2023 , the Company had issued 48,697,467 shares of common stock, of which 47,331,819 were outstanding. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company repurchased no shares of common stock. Dividends During the three months ended March 31, 2023 , the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.35 per common share, or $ 16.8 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On May 2, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $ 0.35 per share to be paid on June 30, 2023 to all shareholders of record of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on June 16, 2023 . All future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. 15.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Company’s Human Capital Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through March 31, 2023 , the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024 . As of March 31, 2023 , there were 1,518,633 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to five years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 , the Company granted 106,712 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 15.8 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 3.1 million and $ 4.0 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.5 million and $ 1.5 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 531,000 and $ 518,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , 46,353 and 49,794 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 6.4 million and $ 7.8 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 68,000 and $ 120,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 355,000 and $ 309,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 3,104 and 2,196 shares, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's achievement of specified financial metrics such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), cash flow, and/or gross margin, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a three-year performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is three times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's performance falls below certain thresholds, the performance units will not vest at all. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 , the Company granted 84,448 performance units, of which 42,222 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on three-year cumulative adjusted EBITDA, 21,113 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on three-year cumulative gross margin and 21,113 units are subject to market-based, TSR vesting requirements. The grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 12.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 18 2023, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte Carlo simulation model used for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded selling, general and administrative reduction of expense of $ 890,000 and expense of $ 68,000 , respectively, research and development reduction of expense of $ 231,000 and $ 28,000 , respectively, and cost of sales reduction of expense of $ 143,000 and $ 19,000 , respectively, related to the performance units. The reduction of expense was primarily due to current expectations of future vesting as they relate to Company performance. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , 5,350 and 563 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 750,000 and $ 88,000 , respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company issued 5,639 and 2,875 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 518,000 and $ 403,000 , respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company recorded charges of $ 40,000 and $ 25,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 71,000 and $ 51,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 41,000 and $ 29,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , the Company granted a total of 2,366 and 2,024 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The fair value of shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both three-month periods. 17. RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFIT LIABILITY: On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of March 31, 2023 , there were eight participants in the SERP. In December 2022, one of the participants retired and monthly SERP benefit payments commenced in January 2023. The total SERP benefit payments for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $504,000. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. 19 The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Service cost $ 238 $ 361 Interest cost 724 346 Amortization of prior service cost 204 280 Amortization of loss 120 372 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,286 $ 1,359 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the current research agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by it under that agreement, and by the University of Michigan (Michigan) under a subcontractor agreement that Michigan has with USC. Under the terms of the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the Company makes royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 11 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with five executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 13) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 33.9 million and $ 31.9 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. 20 19. CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended March 31, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2023 2022 March 31, 2023 A 30 % 40 % $ 8,780 B 26 % 27 % $ 34,100 C 21 % 15 % $ 29,887 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % for both three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, Country 2023 2022 South Korea $ 66,060 $ 89,687 China 57,427 55,400 Japan 1,647 1,053 Other non-U.S. locations 1,337 300 Total non-U.S. locations 126,471 146,440 United States 3,996 4,030 Total revenue $ 130,467 $ 150,470 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 United States $ 115,915 $ 117,255 Ireland $ 23,845 $ 20,270 Other 5,521 5,920 Total long-lived assets $ 145,281 $ 143,445 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 13 for further explanation. 20. INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 22.8 % and 20.1 % for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 , respectively. The discrepancy between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is primarily due to nondeductible employee compensation and U.S. international tax (GILTI and Subpart F) partially offset by the benefit of income taxed in foreign jurisdictions. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 11.8 million and $ 12.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is not sufficient evidence to release the valuation allowance that has been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit and unrealized loss on investments, and no indicators against the realizability of the remaining net deferred tax asset. The U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) for the years ended December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2017 was closed in September 2022, resulting in a refund of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld. The Company will amend the U.S. federal tax returns to reflect the refund and to redetermine the foreign tax credit amount. In November 2022, the Company prepaid $ 18.8 million to the IRS under Rev. Proc. 2005-18 to offset the tax payable amount. On December 27, 2018, regarding the withholding taxes for the years 2018 to 2022, the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are considered Korean source income and subject to Korean 21 withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Based on the Korean Supreme Court decision, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for the entire period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. The Company has since been advised by a prominent Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. The Company recorded foreign exchange loss of $ 1.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to the fluctuation of the Korean Won to the U.S. Dollar and resulting remeasurement of this Won-denominated receivable. The Company will also amend U.S. federal tax returns for the 2018 to 2020 years when the anticipated refund from KNTS is received to offset the additional tax liability and to redetermine the research and development credit utilization. In November 2022, the Company prepaid $ 16.0 million to the IRS under Rev. Proc. 2005-18 that relates to the anticipated tax payable. As a result, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 59.9 million and $ 60.9 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Also, as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a long-term liability of $ 15.0 million and $ 14.6 million, respectively, for the estimated amounts due to the U.S. federal government based on the amendment of the Company's U.S. tax returns indicating that lower withholding amounts were required. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2018 to 2021 are open and subject to examination. The Company's state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. 21. REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded 96 % and 97 %, respectively, of its revenue from OLED related sales and 4 % and 3 %, respectively, from the providing of services through Adesis. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of March 31, 2023 Accounts receivable $ 92,677 Short-term unbilled receivables 15,968 Short-term contract assets 2,541 Long-term contract assets 11,323 Short-term deferred revenue 37,419 Long-term deferred revenue 17,843 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables and contract assets are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2023 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of March 31, 2023 , the Company had $ 19.6 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the assets and liabilities balances associated with the Company's contracts from customers for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands): 22 Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Assets Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 38,457 $ ( 63,878 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 41,086 Increases due to cash received — ( 38,153 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 5,683 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 11,878 — Contract assets recorded, net ( 520 ) — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 19,983 ) — Net change ( 8,625 ) 8,616 Balance at March 31, 2023 $ 29,832 $ ( 55,262 ) Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Assets Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 8,127 $ ( 157,081 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 57,594 Increases due to cash received — ( 45,891 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 1,865 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 4,647 — Net change 4,647 13,568 Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 12,774 $ ( 143,513 ) The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased by $ 3.8 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in the cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was primarily due to a decrease in anticipated customer demand over their remaining contract lives. 22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 23 The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Numerator: Net income $ 39,839 $ 49,970 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 213 ) ( 325 ) Adjusted net income $ 39,626 $ 49,645 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,523,593 47,369,764 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 940 191 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 42,474 70,326 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,567,007 47,440,281 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.83 $ 1.05 Diluted $ 0.83 $ 1.05 For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 41,505 and 14,298 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 23. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS: On April 28, 2023, UDC Ireland entered into a Patent Sale and License Agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA). Under this agreement, Merck KGaA sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and licensed OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $ 66.0 million. The Patent Sale and License Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. 24 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the sections entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as supplemented by disclosures in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. On December 2, 2022, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement 25 term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of red and green phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) which has operations in New Castle and Wilmington, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of March 31, 2023, Adesis employed a team of 146 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of March 31, 2023, OVJP Corp employed a team of 23 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation 26 of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. We currently lease the Shannon site and have a contractual option to purchase the facility. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. The first phase of facility improvements has been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: 27 Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics, epidemics and disease outbreaks. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continued to have a gradually lesser impact during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the three months ended March 31, 2023. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, there is the potential for continued impact on the results of our operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what effects any such potential actions could have on our business, including on our customers, employees, and financial results. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 70,190 $ 86,691 $ (16,501 ) Royalty and license fees 55,210 59,802 (4,592 ) Contract research services 5,067 3,977 1,090 Total revenue 130,467 150,470 (20,003 ) COST OF SALES 32,970 33,163 (193 ) Gross margin 97,497 117,307 (19,810 ) OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 31,423 26,545 4,878 Selling, general and administrative 15,396 21,062 (5,666 ) Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 2,891 5,498 (2,607 ) Patent costs 2,255 1,798 457 Royalty and license expense 164 154 10 Total operating expenses 52,129 55,057 (2,928 ) OPERATING INCOME 45,368 62,250 (16,882 ) Interest income, net 6,967 291 6,676 Other loss, net (703 ) (34 ) (669 ) Interest and other loss, net 6,264 257 6,007 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 51,632 62,507 (10,875 ) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (11,793 ) (12,537 ) 744 NET INCOME $ 39,839 $ 49,970 $ (10,131 ) Revenue Our total material sales were $70.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $86.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of 19% with a commensurate decrease in unit material volume of 18%. The decline in material sales was primarily due to reduced demand for our emitter material. This weakness resulted from the continued unfavorable macroeconomic conditions that have negatively impacted the OLED display market segment. We believe the decline is temporary and that the duration is dependent upon the timing of the recovery of the global market conditions, which continues to be uncertain. 28 Revenue from royalty and license fees was $55.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to $59.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in royalty and license fees was primarily the result of lower unit material volume. The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net of $5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts, resulting from the continued deterioration in the global market economy as evidenced by weakness in consumer demand caused by higher interest rates and inflationary pricing pressures. At this time, substantial uncertainty exists as to the projected duration and intensity of this global market deterioration and the extent to which it will negatively impact such customers' near-term production requirements. Contract research services revenue was $5.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, an increase of 27%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased by $193,000 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the level of material sales, offset by an increase in manufacturing costs, underutilization of the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and higher per unit material costs. The underutilization charges related to the Shannon facility were $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Shannon facility costs began to be recorded as cost of sales in June 2022 when the facility was first used for production activities. Shannon facility costs prior to June 2022 were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that the Shannon facility will continue to be underutilized in the near-term as we have begun to bring this additional capacity online in preparation for anticipated growth in the years ahead. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was an increase in inventory reserve of $3.3 million and $84,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the decrease in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees as well as the inventory reserve and Shannon costs, gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased by $19.8 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 75% from 78%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $31.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $26.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased contract research and those associated with PPG development activity, and employee-related compensation expenses. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $15.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $21.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expenses as a result of current assumptions of future vesting for performance-based awards and a decrease in pre-production costs associated with the Shannon facility. The Shannon facility became operational during June 2022 and the costs associated with this facility have since been included in cost of sales. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The decrease was due to the Fujifilm patents becoming fully amortized during July 2022. Patent costs 29 Patent costs increased to $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The results in the current year reflected higher internal prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $164,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $154,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Interest and other loss, net Interest income, net was $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $291,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022 as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other loss, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $703,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to $34,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 22.8% and 20.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $11.8 million and $12.5 million, respectively, for those periods. The effective income tax rate increased due to a change in U.S. tax legislation associated with the ability to credit Chinese withholding taxes, as well as a change in the capitalization rules for research and development expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of March 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $158.3 million, short-term investments of $487.8 million, and long-term corporate bonds and U.S. Government bonds investments of $199.3 million for a total of $845.4 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $93.4 million, short-term investments of $484.3 million, and long-term U.S. Government bond investments of $247.9 million for a total of $825.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $47.6 million resulting from $39.8 million of net income, $5.1 million from non-cash items including depreciation, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes and $2.7 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to a decrease in other assets of $14.1 million, an increase in other liabilities of $12.3 million and a decrease in inventory of $9.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $24.1 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $8.6 million, and an increase in accounts receivable of $13,000. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $52.6 million resulting from $50.0 million of net income and $49.3 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $46.7 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $45.9 million, an increase in other liabilities of $8.2 million, a decrease in other assets of $6.0 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.7 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $9.2 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.3 million. Cash provided by investing activities was $40.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $14.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales and maturities of $49.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles of $1.6 million. 30 Cash used in financing activities was $23.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $21.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $2.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $715,000 and an increase in the proceeds from issuance of common stock of $115,000. Working capital was $835.3 million as of March 31, 2023, as compared to $763.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of March 31, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. 31 Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHE R INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. ITEM 1A.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light and can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize the Company’s proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting and contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2022 and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 . The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (UDC Korea), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 7 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. 8 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, they are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or predetermined rates on a contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the lives of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under 9 various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partner's, and at the Company's internal, manufacturing processing facilities. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for the BASF patents. The Fujifilm acquired technology was fully amortized over a period of 10 years that ended in July 2022. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets primarily relate to the Adesis acquisition and are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years. See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland and UDC Korea subsidiaries are also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign 10 subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted Fair Value of Equity Investments. In 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-03, ""Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions."" Under this standard, a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring the security's fair value. The standard also requires certain disclosures for equity securities that are subject to contractual restrictions. The ASU becomes effective January 1, 2024, and the Company is evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its investments. 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government bonds, corporate bonds and convertible notes. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security 11 investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method.

Minority investments and convertible notes are included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2022 , the Company had four minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 15.0 million accounted for as equity securities without readily determinable fair values as compared to two minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 8.5 million as of December 31, 2021.

Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of September 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021 . 5.

LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of September 30, 2022 , the Company did not have any finance 15 leases and had one operating lease that had not yet commenced, related to expansion of the Adesis research facilities in Wilmington, Delaware.

EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENT: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which, effective as of October 1, 2011, replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement, by amendment in February 2021, runs through December 31, 2024, and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares have been issued for services rendered by PPG since the inception of the contract. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. In February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to UDC Ireland, at the Company’s new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by UDC Ireland’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OMM, for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements have been completed and operations commenced in 17 June 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 2.6 million and $ 789,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and $ 4.9 million and $ 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 14. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $ 7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote . The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of September 30, 2022 , the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of September 30, 2022 , the Company had issued 49,128,525 shares of common stock, of which 47,762,877 were outstanding.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Company’s Human Capital Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through September 30, 2022 , the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024 .

Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to five years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , the Company granted 110,128 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 16.0 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 3.4 million and $ 3.8 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.5 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 573,000 and $ 598,000 , respectively.

For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 32,000 and $ 48,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 183,000 and $ 160,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 315,000 and $ 300,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 937,000 and $ 891,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 6,588 and 4,062 shares, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to EBITDA and cash flow achievement, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a three-year performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is three times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units will not vest at all. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , the Company granted 100,621 performance units, of which 50,309 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on EBITDA, 25,156 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on the Company's achievement of cash from operations, and 25,156 units are subject to market-based, TSR vesting requirements. The grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte Carlo simulation model used for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.9 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 488,000 and $ 476,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 303,000 and $ 292,000 , respectively, related to the performance units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 3.7 million and $ 3.8 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 873,000 and $ 1.0 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 539,000 and $ 624,000 , respectively, related to the performance units. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , 5,082 and 3,881 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 826,000 and $ 875,000 , respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 20 Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company issued 13,026 and 6,508 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 1.2 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded charges of $ 3,000 and $ 20,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 19,000 and $ 46,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 14,000 and $ 25,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , the Company recorded charges of $ 86,000 and $ 78,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 183,000 and $ 140,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 110,000 and $ 86,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 17. RETIREMENT PLAN BENEFIT LIABILITY: On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of September 30, 2022 , there were eight participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Service cost $ 282 $ 419 $ 1,005 $ 1,276 Interest cost 346 291 1,038 874 Amortization of prior service cost 280 275 839 824 Amortization of loss 372 1,234 1,116 3,702 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,280 $ 2,219 $ 3,998 $ 6,676 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the current research agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by it under that agreement, and by the University of Michigan (Michigan) under a subcontractor agreement that Michigan has with USC. 21 Under the terms of the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the Company makes royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 11 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 13) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 36.6 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s material sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 In September 2022, the Opposition Division made a final determination that the patent, which was described in prior filings and has now expired in accordance with its original term, was valid based on amended claims submitted by the Company to the Opposition Division in 2016. 19. CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended September 30, % of Total Revenue for the Nine Months Ended September 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2022 2021 2022 2021 September 30, 2022 A 46 % 50 % 42 % 46 % $ 10,354 B 23 % 27 % 26 % 25 % $ 28,677 C 12 % 7 % 14 % 14 % $ 9,548 22 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % for both three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Country 2022 2021 2022 2021 South Korea $ 100,555 $ 95,741 $ 269,338 $ 250,040 China 52,906 41,323 159,486 138,135 Japan 2,011 1,911 4,456 5,227 Other non-U.S. locations 976 537 1,991 2,257 Total non-U.S. locations 156,448 139,512 435,271 395,659 United States 4,108 4,106 12,316 11,619 Total revenue $ 160,556 $ 143,618 $ 447,587 $ 407,278 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 United States $ 115,282 $ 115,004 Ireland $ 16,695 $ 7,000 Other 5,736 6,828 Total long-lived assets $ 137,713 $ 128,832 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 13 for further explanation. 20. INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 23.7 % and 20.2 % for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and 22.7 % and 19.4 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The discrepancy between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is primarily due to nondeductible employee compensation and U.S. international tax (GILTI and Subpart F) partially offset by the benefit of income taxed in foreign jurisdictions. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 16.6 million and $ 11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and $ 42.7 million and $ 33.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million each year since the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on the Korean Supreme Court decision, in October 2021, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for over-withheld taxes from 2018 to the second quarter of 2021. The Company has been advised by a prominent Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. The Company has also filed an administrative hearing request to the Korean Tax Tribunal in order to expedite the refund process. The hearing has not yet started and the case is pending in the Korean Tax Tribunal. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 63.1 million and $ 53.2 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents. Also, as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the Company has recorded a long-term liability of $ 41.4 million and $ 31.6 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of the Company's U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) which had been accepted by the KNTS on September 15, 2017 was closed in September 2022. The closing resulted in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld, causing immaterial adjustments to the accrued long-term assets, long-term payables, and 23 deferred tax assets. As such, as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 39.5 million and $ 36.9 million, respectively, for estimated refunds due from the Korean government and a long-term payable of $ 18.8 million and $ 16.2 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts. The Company also recorded a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million on the September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. Subsequent to September 30, 2022, the Company has been notified that the KNTS is in the process of refunding the withholding taxes previously withheld and should be received within the next quarter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a prominent Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlying intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of December 31, 2021. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled entirely in the favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue and the ruling was affirmed by the Korean High Court in August 2021. The KNTS appealed the ruling to the Korean Supreme Court. On January 13, 2022, the Korean Supreme Court dismissed the appeal from the KNTS. UDC Ireland recovered the charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding plus interest for the three-year period during February 2022. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2018 to 2021 are open and subject to examination. The Company's state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. 21. REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. For both three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, t he Company recorded 97 % of its revenue from OLED related sales and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of September 30, 2022 Accounts receivable $ 78,193 Short-term unbilled receivables 13,629 Short-term deferred revenue 67,254 Long-term deferred revenue 26,761 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2022 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of September 30, 2022 , the Company had $ 25.5 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, are as follows (in thousands): 24 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 8,127 $ ( 157,081 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 178,737 Increases due to cash received — ( 132,961 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 17,290 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 5,502 — Net change 5,502 63,066 Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 13,629 $ ( 94,015 ) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 145,535 Increases due to cash received — ( 160,021 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 9,854 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 24,209 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 7,147 ) — Net change 17,062 ( 4,632 ) Balance at September 30, 2021 $ 27,491 $ ( 166,933 ) The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $ 7.4 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in the cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was primarily due to a decrease in anticipated customer demand over their remaining contract lives. 22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 25 The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 53,455 $ 46,109 $ 144,927 $ 138,337 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 289 ) ( 255 ) ( 849 ) ( 857 ) Adjusted net income $ 53,166 $ 45,854 $ 144,078 $ 137,480 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,396,495 47,291,192 47,386,426 47,286,927 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 729 400 1,814 769 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 69,710 70,983 67,653 67,887 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,466,934 47,362,575 47,455,893 47,355,583 Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.12 $ 0.97 $ 3.04 $ 2.91 Diluted $ 1.12 $ 0.97 $ 3.04 $ 2.90 For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 173,707 and none , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 121,962 and none , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 26 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the sections entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by disclosures in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. 27 At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) which has operations in New Castle and Wilmington, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of September 30, 2022, Adesis employed a team of 141 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of September 30, 2022, OVJP employed a team of 20 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to double 28 our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. The first phase of facility improvements has been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continued to have an impact during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2022. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, it may potentially have a further adverse impact on the results of our operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted through at least the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, including as a result of: We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year. 29 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 84,182 $ 75,609 $ 8,573 Royalty and license fees 71,450 63,939 7,511 Contract research services 4,924 4,070 854 Total revenue 160,556 143,618 16,938 COST OF SALES 37,396 31,481 5,915 Gross margin 123,160 112,137 11,023 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 30,414 25,327 5,087 Selling, general and administrative 18,442 20,960 (2,518 ) Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 3,562 5,505 (1,943 ) Patent costs 2,018 2,359 (341 ) Royalty and license expense 261 258 3 Total operating expenses 54,697 54,409 288 OPERATING INCOME 68,463 57,728 10,735 Interest income, net 2,432 137 2,295 Other loss, net (804 ) (102 ) (702 ) Interest and other income, net 1,628 35 1,593 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 70,091 57,763 12,328 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (16,636 ) (11,654 ) (4,982 ) NET INCOME $ 53,455 $ 46,109 $ 7,346 Revenue Our total material sales were $84.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $75.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 11% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 8%. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $71.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $63.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 12%. This increase was primarily the result of higher unit material volume and customer mix. The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was $6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by certain of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts, resulting from the continued deterioration in the global market economy as evidenced by weakness in consumer demand caused by higher interest rates and inflationary pricing pressures. At this time, substantial uncertainty exists as to the projected duration and intensity of this global market deterioration and the extent to which it will negatively impact such customers' near-term production requirements. Contract research services revenue was $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 21%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $5.9 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales with an associated increase in manufacturing costs, 30 underutilization of the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and higher per unit material costs. The underutilization charges related to the Shannon facility were $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Shannon facility costs began to be recorded as cost of sales in June 2022 when the facility was first used for production activities. Shannon facility costs prior to June 2022 were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that the Shannon facility will continue to be underutilized in the near-term as we have begun to bring this additional capacity online in preparation for anticipated growth in the years ahead. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was an increase in inventory reserve of $1.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees, gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $11.0 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 77% from 78%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $30.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $25.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including those associated with PPG development activity and increased contract research. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $18.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $21.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower employee-related compensation expenses and a decrease in pre-production costs associated with the Shannon facility. The Shannon facility became operational during June 2022 and the costs associated with this facility have since been included in cost of sales. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease was due to the Fujifilm patents becoming fully amortized during the three months ended September 30, 2022. Patent costs Patent costs decreased to $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The results in the current year reflected lower internal prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $261,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $258,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under the license agreement with our academic partners, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 11 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other loss, net Interest income, net was $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $137,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to higher available-for-sale investment balances as well as an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended September 30, 2021. Other loss, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $804,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $102,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021. 31 Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 23.7% and 20.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $16.6 million and $11.7 million, respectively, for those periods. The effective income tax rate increased due to a change in U.S. tax legislation associated with the ability to credit Chinese withholding taxes, as well as a change in the capitalization rules for research and development expenses. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 242,742 $ 232,855 $ 9,887 Royalty and license fees 191,530 163,037 28,493 Contract research services 13,315 11,386 1,929 Total revenue 447,587 407,278 40,309 COST OF SALES 97,798 82,748 15,050 Gross margin 349,789 324,530 25,259 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 85,156 72,733 12,423 Selling, general and administrative 59,373 57,603 1,770 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 14,562 16,490 (1,928 ) Patent costs 6,075 6,003 72 Royalty and license expense 596 519 77 Total operating expenses 165,762 153,348 12,414 OPERATING INCOME 184,027 171,182 12,845 Interest income, net 4,306 345 3,961 Other (loss) income, net (749 ) 178 (927 ) Interest and other income, net 3,557 523 3,034 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 187,584 171,705 15,879 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (42,657 ) (33,368 ) (9,289 ) NET INCOME $ 144,927 $ 138,337 $ 6,590 Revenue Our total material sales were $242.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $232.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 4% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 5%. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $191.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $163.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 17%. This increase was primarily the result of higher unit material volume and customer mix. The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was $17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts, resulting from the continued deterioration in the global market economy as evidenced by weakness in consumer demand caused by higher interest rates and inflationary pricing pressures. In addition, the average price per gram increased due to higher royalty and license revenue as a result of increased sales of OLED products by certain customers. At this time, substantial uncertainty exists as to the projected duration and intensity of this global market deterioration and the extent to which it will negatively impact such customers' near-term production requirements. 32 Contract research services revenue was $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 17%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $15.1 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales with an associated increase in manufacturing costs, underutilization of the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and higher per unit material costs. The underutilization charges related to the Shannon facility were $4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Shannon facility charges began to be recorded as cost of sales in June 2022 when the facility was first used for production activities. Shannon facility costs prior to June 2022 were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that the Shannon facility will continue to be underutilized in the near-term as we have begun to bring this additional capacity online in preparation for anticipated growth in the years ahead. Included in the cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was an increase in inventory reserve of $2.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from royalty and license fees and material sales, gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $25.3 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 78% from 80%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $85.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $72.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including those associated with OVJP technology development, increased contract research, and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $59.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $57.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased pre-production costs associated with the Shannon facility, as well as an increase in depreciation expense resulting from corporate expansion, partially offset by lower employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decrease was due to the Fujifilm patents becoming fully amortized during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Patent costs Patent costs were relatively consistent between periods at $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $596,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $519,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under the license agreement with our academic partners, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 11 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $345,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to higher available-for-sale investment balances as well as an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Other income, net primarily 33 consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $749,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $178,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 22.7% and 19.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $42.7 million and $33.4 million, respectively, for those periods. The effective income tax rate increased due to a change in U.S. tax legislation associated with the ability to credit Chinese withholding taxes, as well as a change in the capitalization rules for research and development expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of September 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $187.8 million, short-term investments of $501.0 million, and long-term corporate bonds and U.S. Government bonds investments of $154.9 million for a total of $843.7 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $312.0 million, short-term investments of $351.2 million, and long-term U.S. Government bond investments of $159.6 million for a total of $822.8 million as of December 31, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $124.2 million resulting from $144.9 million of net income and $129.6 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $150.3 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $133.0 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $29.5 million, an increase in other liabilities of $9.6 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.2 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $48.4 million and an increase in other assets of $1.3 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $134.3 million resulting from $138.3 million of net income and $94.1 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $98.1 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $160.0 million and an increase in other liabilities of $30.5 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $47.1 million, an increase in inventory of $32.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $14.0 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.3 million. Cash used in investing activities was $197.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $187.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $161.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $157.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, and an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase in intangible purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to a patent purchase. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and improvements to our facilities in Ewing, New Jersey. Cash used in financing activities was $50.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $42.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $14.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $5.7 million and an increase in the proceeds from issuance of common stock of $111,000. Working capital was $839.0 million as of September 30, 2022, as compared to $738.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, a decrease in deferred revenue and an increase in inventory, partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response to the pandemic may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. 34 We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 35 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHE R INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our material sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 In September 2022, the Opposition Division made a final determination that the patent, which was described in prior filings and has now expired in accordance with its original term, was valid based on amended claims submitted by us to the Opposition Division in 2016.

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light and can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize the Company’s proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting and contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of June 30, 2022 and results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (UDC Korea), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 7 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. 8 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, they are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The 9 Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, the Company entered into amendments of the 2015 OLED patent license agreement and the 2015 OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which amendments were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. 10 Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets primarily relate to the Adesis acquisition and are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years. See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland and UDC Korea subsidiaries are also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted Fair Value of Equity Investments. In 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-03, ""Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions."" Under this standard, a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring the security's fair value. The standard also requires certain disclosures for equity securities that are subject to contractual restrictions. The ASU becomes effective January 1, 2024, and the Company is evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its investments. 11 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government bonds, corporate bonds and convertible notes. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value June 30, 2022 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 174,235 $ — $ — $ 174,235 Money market accounts 12,670 — — 12,670 Corporate bonds 26,991 — — 26,991 $ 213,896 $ — $ — $ 213,896 December 31, 2021 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 256,878 $ — $ — $ 256,878 Money market accounts 55,115 — — 55,115 $ 311,993 $ — $ — $ 311,993 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value June 30, 2022 Corporate bonds $ 257,133 $ — $ ( 791 ) $ 256,342 U.S. Government bonds 184,307 8 ( 1,208 ) 183,107 $ 441,440 $ 8 $ ( 1,999 ) $ 439,449 December 31, 2021 Certificates of deposit $ 240 $ — $ — $ 240 Corporate bonds 226,448 3 ( 97 ) 226,354 U.S. Government bonds 124,611 — ( 11 ) 124,600 $ 351,299 $ 3 $ ( 108 ) $ 351,194 Long-term Corporate Bonds and U.S. Government Bonds Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of long-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Long-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value June 30, 2022 Corporate bonds $ 1,768 $ — $ ( 204 ) $ 1,564 U.S. Government bonds 184,698 7 ( 5,135 ) 179,570 $ 186,466 $ 7 $ ( 5,339 ) $ 181,134 December 31, 2021 U.S. Government bonds $ 159,692 $ 10 $ ( 134 ) $ 159,568 $ 159,692 $ 10 $ ( 134 ) $ 159,568 Long-term Minority Investments and Convertible Notes The Company’s portfolio of minority investments and convertible notes consist of investments in privately held early-stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company typically does not seek to obtain representation on the boards of directors of the companies in which it invests. Minority investments and convertible notes 12 are included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had four minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 15.0 million accounted for as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had one convertible note investment with a fair value of $ 4.0 million accounted for as an available-for-sale debt security with a level 3 fair value measurement. 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2022 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of June 30, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 39,661 $ 39,661 $ — $ — Short-term investments 439,449 439,449 — — Long-term U.S. Government bonds investments 179,570 179,570 — — Convertible notes 4,000 — — 4,000 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 55,115 $ 55,115 $ — $ — Short-term investments 351,194 351,194 — — Long-term U.S. Government bonds investments 159,568 159,568 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of June 30, 2022 or December 31, 2021. 5. INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Raw materials $ 92,032 $ 75,227 Work-in-process 16,536 16,065 Finished goods 57,067 42,868 Inventory $ 165,635 $ 134,160 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $ 604,000 and $ 450,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 688,000 and $ 1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. 13 6. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment, net consist of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Land $ 2,642 $ 2,642 Building and improvements 83,475 76,600 Office and lab equipment 119,499 107,168 Furniture, fixtures and computer related assets 17,087 16,221 Construction-in-progress 19,206 18,662 241,909 221,293 Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 103,881 ) ( 92,461 ) Property and equipment, net $ 138,028 $ 128,832 Depreciation expense was $ 5.9 million and $ 4.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 11.5 million and $ 9.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 7. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization consist of acquired technology and other intangible assets that include trade names, customer relationships and developed intellectual property (IP) processes. Acquired Technology Acquired technology consists of acquired license rights for patents and know-how obtained from PD-LD, Inc., Motorola, BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm.

Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 5.5 million for the six months ending December 31, 2022, $ 9.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2023, $ 9.6 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, $ 4.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2026 and $ 200,000 in total thereafter. Fujifilm Patent Acquisition On July 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Patent Sale Agreement with Fujifilm. Under the agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $ 105.0 million, plus costs incurred in connection with the purchase. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The agreement permitted the Company to assign all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to its affiliates, and the Company assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement, its rights and obligations to UDC Ireland, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. The Company recorded the $ 105.0 million plus $ 4.5 million of purchase costs as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights 14 relating to the composition of, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of €86.8 million ($ 95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $ 217,000 as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $ 16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $ 10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $ 4.8 million of internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $ 1.5 million assigned to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years. At June 30, 2022, these other intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2022 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Customer relationships $ 10,520 $ ( 5,426 ) $ 5,094 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 ( 1,908 ) 2,912 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 ( 893 ) 607 Other 448 ( 46 ) 402 Total identifiable other intangible assets $ 17,288 $ ( 8,273 ) $ 9,015 Amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $ 355,000 and $ 351,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 708,000 and $ 693,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 717,000 for the six months ending December 31, 2022, $ 1.4 million for each of the next four fiscal years (2023 - 2026) and $ 2.7 million in total thereafter. 8. OTHER ASSETS: Other assets consist of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Long-term taxes receivable $ 96,701 $ 103,260 Right-of-use assets 28,544 30,614 Other long-term assets 2,943 1,836 Other assets $ 128,188 $ 135,710 See Notes 9 and 20 for further explanation on right-of-use assets and non-current taxes receivable, respectively. 9. LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments.

EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG, effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement, by amendment in February 2021, runs through December 31, 2024, and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three or six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. In February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to UDC Ireland, at the Company’s new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by UDC Ireland’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OMM, for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements have been completed and operations started to commence in June 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 796,000 and $ 738,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 2.3 million and $ 2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 17 14. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC.

The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had issued 49,115,444 shares of common stock, of which 47,749,796 were outstanding.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Company’s Human Capital Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through June 30, 2022, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024 . As of June 30, 2022, there were 1,579,626 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to five years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company granted 100,741 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 15.1 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 3.4 million and $ 4.1 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.6 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 567,000 and $ 711,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 7.4 million and $ 7.7 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 3.1 million and $ 2.5 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, 1,616 and 14,660 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 210,000 and $ 3.4 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, 51,400 and 60,827 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 8.0 million and $ 12.1 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 31,000 and $ 76,000 , respectively.

The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 313,000 and $ 297,000 , respectively.

Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to EBITDA and cash flow achievement, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a three-year performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is three times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units will not vest at all. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company granted 100,621 performance units, of which 50,309 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on EBITDA, 25,156 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on the Company's achievement of cash from operations, and 25,156 units are subject to market-based, TSR vesting requirements. The grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 15.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte Carlo simulation model used for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.7 million and $ 2.2 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 413,000 and $ 596,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 256,000 and $ 366,000 , respectively, related to the performance units. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.8 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 385,000 and $ 503,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 237,000 and $ 332,000 , respectively, related to the performance units. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, 5,082 and 3,881 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 826,000 and $ 875,000 , respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. 20 During the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company issued 8,042 and 4,105 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 847,000 and $ 787,000 , respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded charges of $ 60,000 and $ 35,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 113,000 and $ 58,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 66,000 and $ 36,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded charges of $ 85,000 and $ 58,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 164,000 and $ 95,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 95,000 and $ 60,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 17. SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of June 30, 2022, there were eight participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Service cost $ 362 $ 429 $ 723 $ 857 Interest cost 346 292 692 583 Amortization of prior service cost 279 274 559 549 Amortization of loss 372 1,234 744 2,468 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,359 $ 2,229 $ 2,718 $ 4,457 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the current research agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by it under that agreement, and by the University of Michigan (Michigan) under a subcontractor agreement that Michigan has with USC. Under the terms of the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the Company makes royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 11 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 13) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 40.4 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively. 21 Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s material sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 The European patent that is subject to the above opposition, which was described in prior filings, has now expired in accordance with its original term. Although the opposition proceedings on this patent may continue, the Company does not believe the expiration of the patent or the result of the proceedings will have any material impact on the Company’s material sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 19. CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended June 30, % of Total Revenue for the Six Months Ended June 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2022 2021 2022 2021 June 30, 2022 A 39 % 51 % 39 % 43 % $ 10,467 B 30 % 26 % 29 % 24 % $ 37,895 C 14 % 15 % 15 % 18 % $ 4,892 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % for both three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Country 2022 2021 2022 2021 South Korea $ 79,096 $ 86,324 $ 168,783 $ 154,299 China 51,180 36,308 106,580 96,812 Japan 1,392 2,001 2,445 3,316 Other non-U.S. locations 715 895 1,015 1,720 Total non-U.S. locations 132,383 125,528 278,823 256,147 United States 4,178 4,132 8,208 7,513 Total revenue $ 136,561 $ 129,660 $ 287,031 $ 263,660 22 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 United States $ 117,017 $ 115,004 Other 21,011 13,828 Total long-lived assets $ 138,028 $ 128,832 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 13 for further explanation. 20. INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 24.5 % and 19.2 % for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 22.1 % and 19.1 % for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The discrepancy between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is primarily due to nondeductible employee compensation and U.S. international tax (GILTI and Subpart F) partially offset by the benefit of income taxed in foreign jurisdictions. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 13.5 million and $ 9.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 26.0 million and $ 21.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million each year since the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on the Korean Supreme Court decision, in October 2021, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for over-withheld taxes from 2018 to the second quarter of 2021. The Company has been advised by a prominent Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. The Company has also filed an administrative hearing request to the Korean Tax Tribunal in order to expedite the refund process. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 59.8 million and $ 53.2 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents. Also, as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded a long-term liability of $ 38.1 million and $ 31.6 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) which was accepted by the KNTS on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. As such, a long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. The Internal Revenue Service and the KNTS continue to deliberate the final outcome of the settlement. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a prominent Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlying intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of December 31, 2021. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled entirely in the favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue and the ruling was affirmed by the Korean High Court in August 2021. The KNTS appealed the ruling to the Korean Supreme Court. On January 13, 2022, the Korean Supreme Court dismissed the appeal from the KNTS. UDC Ireland recovered the charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding plus interest for the three-year period during February 2022. 23 The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2018 to 2021 are open and subject to examination. The Company's state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. 21. REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. For both three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded 97 % of its revenue from OLED related sales and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of June 30, 2022 Accounts receivable $ 74,933 Short-term unbilled receivables 12,393 Long-term unbilled receivables — Short-term deferred revenue 99,106 Long-term deferred revenue 30,021 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at June 30, 2022 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $ 23.9 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, are as follows (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 8,127 $ ( 157,081 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 110,258 Increases due to cash received — ( 92,976 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 10,672 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 4,266 — Net change 4,266 27,954 Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 12,393 $ ( 129,127 ) Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 81,458 Increases due to cash received — ( 92,816 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 4,507 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 25,028 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 6,000 ) — Net change 19,028 ( 6,851 ) Balance at June 30, 2021 $ 29,457 $ ( 169,152 ) The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net for the six months ended June 30, 2022 increased by $ 6.2 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in the cumulative catch-up adjustment 24 arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was primarily due to a decrease in anticipated customer demand over their remaining contract lives. 22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 41,502 $ 40,541 $ 91,472 $ 92,228 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 235 ) ( 247 ) ( 557 ) ( 602 ) Adjusted net income $ 41,267 $ 40,294 $ 90,915 $ 91,626 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,393,830 47,299,627 47,381,864 47,284,773 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 894 204 1,085 369 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 63,168 57,033 68,405 62,454 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,457,892 47,356,864 47,451,354 47,347,596 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.87 $ 0.85 $ 1.92 $ 1.94 Diluted $ 0.87 $ 0.85 $ 1.92 $ 1.94 For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 173,707 and none , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 57,058 and none , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 25 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions.

As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the sections entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by disclosures in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED), technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. 26 At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, we entered into amendments of the 2015 OLED patent license agreement and the 2015 OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which amendments were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of June 30, 2022, Adesis employed a team of 121 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of June 30, 2022, OVJP employed a team of 21 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the 27 OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. The new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. Facility improvements have been completed and operations started to commence in June 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: 28 Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continued to have an impact during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, it may potentially have a further adverse impact on the results of our operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted through at least the end of the third quarter of 2022, including as a result of: We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year. 29 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 71,869 $ 77,438 $ (5,569 ) Royalty and license fees 60,278 48,212 12,066 Contract research services 4,414 4,010 404 Total revenue 136,561 129,660 6,901 COST OF SALES 27,239 27,969 (730 ) Gross margin 109,322 101,691 7,631 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 28,197 24,101 4,096 Selling, general and administrative 19,869 20,239 (370 ) Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,502 5,497 5 Patent costs 2,259 1,809 450 Royalty and license expense 181 149 32 Total operating expenses 56,008 51,795 4,213 OPERATING INCOME 53,314 49,896 3,418 Interest income, net 1,583 75 1,508 Other income, net 89 221 (132 ) Interest and other income, net 1,672 296 1,376 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 54,986 50,192 4,794 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (13,484 ) (9,651 ) (3,833 ) NET INCOME $ 41,502 $ 40,541 $ 961 Revenue Our total material sales were $71.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $77.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of 7% with a commensurate decrease in unit material volume of 8%. The decrease in material sales was primarily due to near-term weakness in demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material as a result of the deterioration in the overall global market economy. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $60.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $48.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 25%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average contract royalty and license fee per gram assessed to our customers as measured under ASC 606 as a result of a reduction in the forecasted sales volume anticipated over the remaining lives of their respective contracts. The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was $8.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the decrease in anticipated customer demand over their remaining contract lives, resulting from the deterioration in the global market economy. At this time, much uncertainty exists as to the projected duration and intensity of this global market deterioration and the extent to which it will negatively impact our customer's near-term production requirements. Contract research services revenue was $4.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 10%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales 30 Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2022 decreased by $730,000 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in the level of material sales, partially offset by increases in manufacturing costs and higher per unit material costs. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was an increase in inventory reserve of $604,000 and $450,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from royalty and license fees, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from material sales, gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2022 increased by $7.6 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue increasing to 80% from 78%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $28.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $24.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including those associated with OVJP technology development, increased contract research, and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $19.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $20.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower employee-related compensation expenses, partially offset by increased pre-production costs associated with the new manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland, as well as an increase in depreciation expense resulting from corporate expansion. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both three-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $2.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The results in the current year reflected higher internal prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $181,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $149,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 11 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $75,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to higher available-for-sale investment balances as well as an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended June 30, 2021. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $89,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $221,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 24.5% and 19.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $13.5 million and $9.7 million, respectively, for those periods. 31 Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 158,560 $ 157,246 $ 1,314 Royalty and license fees 120,080 99,098 20,982 Contract research services 8,391 7,316 1,075 Total revenue 287,031 263,660 23,371 COST OF SALES 60,402 51,267 9,135 Gross margin 226,629 212,393 14,236 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 54,742 47,406 7,336 Selling, general and administrative 40,931 36,643 4,288 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 11,000 10,985 15 Patent costs 4,057 3,644 413 Royalty and license expense 335 261 74 Total operating expenses 111,065 98,939 12,126 OPERATING INCOME 115,564 113,454 2,110 Interest income, net 1,874 208 1,666 Other income, net 55 280 (225 ) Interest and other income, net 1,929 488 1,441 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 117,493 113,942 3,551 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (26,021 ) (21,714 ) (4,307 ) NET INCOME $ 91,472 $ 92,228 $ (756 ) Revenue Our total material sales were $158.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $157.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 1% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 4%. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $120.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $99.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 21%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average contract royalty and license fee per gram assessed to our customers as measured under ASC 606 as a result of a reduction in the forecasted sales volume anticipated over the remaining lives of their respective contracts. The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was $10.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the decrease in anticipated customer demand over their remaining contract lives, resulting from the deterioration in the global market economy. At this time, much uncertainty exists as to the projected duration and intensity of this global market deterioration and the extent to which it will negatively impact our customer's near-term production requirements. Contract research services revenue was $8.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $7.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, an increase of 15%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2022 increased by $9.1 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to increases in the level of material sales and manufacturing costs and higher per unit material costs. Included in the cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was an increase in inventory reserve of $688,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from royalty and license fees, gross 32 margin for the six months ended June 30, 2022 increased by $14.2 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 79% from 81%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $54.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $47.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including those associated with OVJP technology development, increased contract research, and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $40.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $36.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses, increased pre-production costs associated with the new manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland, as well as an increase in depreciation expense resulting from corporate expansion. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $11.0 million for both six-month periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $4.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $3.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The results in the current year reflected higher internal prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $335,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $261,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 11 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $208,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to higher available-for-sale investment balances as well as an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $55,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $280,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 22.1% and 19.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $26.0 million and $21.7 million, respectively, for those periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of June 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $213.9 million, short-term investments of $439.5 million, and long-term corporate bonds and U.S. Government bonds investments of $181.1 million for a total of $834.5 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $312.0 million, short-term investments of $351.2 million, and long-term U.S. Government bond investments of $159.6 million for a total of $822.8 million as of December 31, 2021. 33 Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $86.1 million resulting from $91.5 million of net income and $82.1 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $87.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $93.0 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $32.7 million and an increase in other liabilities of $1.3 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $32.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.2 million and an increase in other assets of $5.5 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $59.1 million resulting from $92.2 million of net income and $35.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $68.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $92.8 million and an increase in other liabilities of $11.9 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $20.7 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $17.4 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $17.0 million and an increase in inventory of $14.2 million. Cash used in investing activities was $147.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $115.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $126.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $94.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $286,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to the new manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and improvements to our facilities in Ewing, New Jersey. Cash used in financing activities was $36.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $31.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $9.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $4.2 million and an increase in the proceeds from issuance of common stock of $60,000. Working capital was $776.9 million as of June 30, 2022, as compared to $738.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in short-term investments, inventory and other current assets, and a decrease in deferred revenue, partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. 34 Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 30, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHE R INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until 35 the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our material sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 The European patent that is subject to the above opposition, which was described in prior filings, has expired in accordance with its original term. Although the opposition proceedings on this patent may continue, we do not believe the expiration of the patent or the result of the proceedings will have any material impact on our material sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace.

DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize the Company’s proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2022 and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (UDC Korea), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 6 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. 7 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty 8 revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, the Company entered into amendments of the 2015 OLED patent license agreement and the 2015 OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which amendments were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. 9 Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets primarily relate to the Adesis acquisition and are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years. See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland and UDC Korea subsidiaries are also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements. 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government bonds and corporate bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as 10 available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity.

Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of March 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. 5.

LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of March 31, 2022, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): 14 Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Operating lease cost $ 1,098 $ 615 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ — $ 4,720 The following table presents the Company’s operating right-of-use assets and liabilities (in thousands): March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Right-of-use assets $ 29,645 $ 30,614 Short-term lease liabilities 3,333 3,351 Long-term lease liabilities 26,312 27,263 The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: March 31, 2022 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.3 Weighted average discount rate 2.8 % As of March 31, 2022, current operating leases had remaining terms between five months and ten years with options to extend the lease terms.

RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH ACADEMIC PARTNERS: The Company has long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC) for the conduct of research relating to the Company’s OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials. This research 15 had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Stephen R. Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Mark E. Thompson. Under an Amended License Agreement entered into in 1997 by the Company, Princeton and USC (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), the universities granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by the universities for the Company. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company pays Princeton royalties of 3 % of the net sales price for licensed products it sells or 3 % of the revenues the Company receives from its sublicensees for their sale of licensed products. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 154,000 and $ 112,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred to the University of Michigan (Michigan) and the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include Michigan as a party to that agreement. Also in connection with the transfer, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement with USC under which the Company continues to fund organic electronics research being conducted by Professors Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years . The Company makes payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of March 31, 2022, the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 4.1 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement of $ 195,000 and $ 285,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 12.

EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG, effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement, by amendment in February 2021, runs through December 31, 2024, and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. In February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to 16 UDC Ireland, at the Company’s new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by UDC Ireland’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OMM, for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements and regulatory approvals are expected to be completed and operations are scheduled to commence by mid-year 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 1.5 million for both three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 14. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $ 7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote . The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had issued 49,099,830 shares of common stock, of which 47,734,182 were outstanding.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Company’s Human Capital Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through March 31, 2022, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024 . As of March 31, 2022, there were 1,579,746 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to five years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company granted 100,134 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 15.1 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 4.0 million and $ 3.6 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.5 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 518,000 and $ 557,000 , respectively. 18 In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, 49,794 and 48,824 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 7.8 million and $ 9.4 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 120,000 and $ 36,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 309,000 and $ 294,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 2,196 and 1,353 shares, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to EBITDA and cash flow achievement, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a three-year performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is three times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units will not vest at all. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company granted 100,621 performance units, of which 50,309 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on EBITDA, 25,156 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements based on the Company's achievement of cash from operations, and 25,156 units are subject to market-based, TSR vesting requirements. The grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 15.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte Carlo simulation model used for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 68,000 and credit of $ 211,000 , respectively, research and development credit of $ 28,000 and $ 56,000 , respectively, and cost of sales credit of $ 19,000 and $ 35,000 , respectively, related to the performance units. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, 563 and 1,224 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 88,000 and $ 231,000 , respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. 19 During the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company issued 2,875 and 1,782 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 403,000 and $ 348,000 , respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded charges of $ 25,000 and $ 23,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 51,000 and $ 36,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 29,000 and $ 25,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 17. SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of March 31, 2022, there were eight participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Service cost $ 361 $ 428 Interest cost 346 291 Amortization of prior service cost 280 275 Amortization of loss 372 1,234 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,359 $ 2,228 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 11 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 11 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 13) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 42.3 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively. 20 Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s material sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 19. CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended March 31, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2022 2021 March 31, 2022 A 40 % 36 % $ 8,216 B 27 % 23 % $ 42,813 C 15 % 20 % $ 20,622 D 7 % 12 % $ 6,870 21 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % for both three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, Country 2022 2021 South Korea $ 89,687 $ 67,975 China 55,400 60,504 Japan 1,053 1,315 Other non-U.S. locations 300 825 Total non-U.S. locations 146,440 130,619 United States 4,030 3,381 Total revenue $ 150,470 $ 134,000 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 United States $ 115,760 $ 115,004 Other 16,119 13,828 Total long-lived assets $ 131,879 $ 128,832 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 13 for further explanation. 20. INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 20.1 % and 18.9 % for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The discrepancy between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is primarily due to the benefit of income taxed in foreign jurisdictions partially offset by nondeductible employee compensation and U.S. international tax (GILTI and Subpart F). The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 12.5 million and $ 12.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million each year since the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on the Korean Supreme Court decision, in October 2021, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for over-withheld taxes from 2018 to the second quarter of 2021. The Company has been advised by a leading Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 56.6 million and $ 53.2 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents. Also, as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded a long-term liability of $ 34.8 million and $ 31.6 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) which was accepted by the KNTS on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. The Internal Revenue Service and KNTS are currently exchanging information with respect to the MAP. No further notable progress has been made since the last quarter. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. 22 tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlying intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of December 31, 2021. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled entirely in the favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue and the ruling was affirmed by the Korean High Court in August 2021. The KNTS appealed the ruling to the Korean Supreme Court. On January 13, 2022, the Korean Supreme Court dismissed the appeal from the KNTS. UDC Ireland recovered the charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding plus interest for the three-year period during February 2022. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2018 to 2021 are open and subject to examination. The Company's state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. 21. REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. For both three month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded 97 % of its revenue from OLED related sales and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of March 31, 2022 Accounts receivable $ 104,947 Short-term unbilled receivables 12,774 Long-term unbilled receivables — Short-term deferred revenue 111,778 Long-term deferred revenue 31,735 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at March 31, 2022 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of March 31, 2022, the Company had $ 23.8 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 8,127 $ ( 157,081 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 57,594 Increases due to cash received — ( 45,891 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 1,865 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 4,647 — Net change 4,647 13,568 Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 12,774 $ ( 143,513 ) 23 Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 33,439 Increases due to cash received — ( 53,000 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 3,738 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 20,471 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 6,000 ) — Net change 14,471 ( 15,823 ) Balance at March 31, 2021 $ 24,900 $ ( 178,124 ) The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net for the three months ended March 31, 2022 decreased by $ 1.9 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. 22. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except share and per share data): March 31, 2022 2021 Numerator: Net income $ 49,970 $ 51,687 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 325 ) ( 358 ) Adjusted net income $ 49,645 $ 51,329 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,369,764 47,267,921 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 191 165 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 70,326 61,618 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,440,281 47,329,704 Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.05 $ 1.09 Diluted $ 1.05 $ 1.08 For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 14,298 and none , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 24 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the sections entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as supplemented by disclosures in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED), technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. 25 At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, we entered into amendments of the 2015 OLED patent license agreement and the 2015 OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which amendments were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of March 31, 2022, Adesis employed a team of 127 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of March 31, 2022, OVJP employed a team of 23 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the 26 OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. The new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. We anticipate the facility to be operational by mid-year 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: 27 Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continued to have an impact during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the three months ended March 31, 2022. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, it may potentially have a further adverse impact on the results of our operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted for at least the first half of 2022, including as a result of: We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year. 28 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 86,691 $ 79,808 $ 6,883 Royalty and license fees 59,802 50,886 8,916 Contract research services 3,977 3,306 671 Total revenue 150,470 134,000 16,470 COST OF SALES 33,163 23,298 9,865 Gross margin 117,307 110,702 6,605 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 26,545 23,305 3,240 Selling, general and administrative 21,062 16,404 4,658 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,498 5,488 10 Patent costs 1,798 1,835 (37 ) Royalty and license expense 154 112 42 Total operating expenses 55,057 47,144 7,913 OPERATING INCOME 62,250 63,558 (1,308 ) Interest income, net 291 133 158 Other (loss) income, net (34 ) 59 (93 ) Interest and other income, net 257 192 65 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 62,507 63,750 (1,243 ) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (12,537 ) (12,063 ) (474 ) NET INCOME $ 49,970 $ 51,687 $ (1,717 ) Revenue Our total material sales were $86.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to $79.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of 9% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 16%. The increase in material sales was due to strengthened demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $59.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to $50.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of 18%. This increase was primarily due to an overall strengthening of our customers’ sales of royalty-bearing OLED licensed products. Contract research services revenue was $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, an increase of 20%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2022 increased by $9.9 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in the level of material sales and manufacturing costs and higher per unit material costs. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 was an increase in inventory reserve of $84,000 and $667,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees, gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2022 increased by $6.6 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 78% from 83%. 29 Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $26.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to $23.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including those associated with OVJP technology development, increased contract research, and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $21.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to $16.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses, increased pre-production costs associated with the new manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland, as well as an increase in depreciation expenses resulting from corporate expansion. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Patent costs Patent costs were $1.8 million for both three-month periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $154,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to $112,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 11 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $291,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to $133,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to higher available-for-sale investment balances as well as an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $34,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to other income, net of $59,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 20.1% and 18.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $12.5 million and $12.1 million, respectively, for those periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of March 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $357.4 million, short-term investments of $325.1 million, and long-term U.S. Government bond investments of $155.6 million for a total of $838.1 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $312.0 million, short-term investments of $351.2 million, and long-term U.S. Government bond investments of $159.6 million for a total of $822.8 million as of December 31, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $52.6 million resulting from $50.0 million of net income and $49.3 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $46.7 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $45.9 million, an increase in other liabilities of $8.2 million, a decrease in other assets of $6.0 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.7 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $9.2 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.3 million. 30 Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $29.5 million resulting from $51.7 million of net income and $16.8 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $39.0 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $53.0 million and an increase in other liabilities of $6.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $21.1 million, an increase in inventory of $10.5 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $9.1 million and an increase in other assets of $1.8 million. Cash provided by investing activities was $14.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to $85.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The decrease was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net maturities of $25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to $95.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $527,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2022 was primarily due to improvements to our facilities in Ewing, New Jersey. Cash used in financing activities was $21.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to $18.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $4.8, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $1.7 million and an increase in the proceeds from issuance of common stock of $55,000. Working capital was $781.5 million as of March 31, 2022, as compared to $738.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in short term investments. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. 31 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of March 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHE R INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. 32 Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our material sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to our white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, the we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace.

BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license the Company’s proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2021 and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. In November 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UDC Ireland, OMM, was formed as an Ireland limited company. Based out of Shannon, Ireland, OMM was formed to increase the Company’s production capacity to meet market demand and diversify the manufacturing base due to evolving industry requirements. 7 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. 8 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty 9 revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, the Company entered into amendments of the OLED patent license agreement and the OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. 10 Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets primarily relate to the Adesis acquisition and are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years. See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government bonds, corporate bonds and convertible notes. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security 11 investments as available-for-sale.

LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of September 30, 2021, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 1,163 $ 537 $ 2,536 $ 1,609 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 16,103 $ — $ 26,174 $ — The increase in right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to the commencement of the operating lease related to expansion of the Adesis research facilities in Wilmington, Delaware. The following table presents the Company’s operating right-of-use assets and liabilities (in thousands): September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Right-of-use assets $ 31,627 $ 8,750 Short-term lease liabilities 3,111 1,871 Long-term lease liabilities 28,516 6,879 15 The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: September 30, 2021 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.8 Weighted average discount rate 2.8 % As of September 30, 2021, current operating leases had remaining terms between eleven months and ten years with options to extend the lease terms.

RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company has long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC), dating back to 1994, for the conduct of research relating to the Company’s OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials. This research had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Stephen R. Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Mark E. Thompson. Under an Amended License Agreement entered into in 1997 by the Company, Princeton and USC (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), Princeton and USC granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by Princeton and USC for the Company. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company pays Princeton royalties of 3 % of the net sales price for licensed products it sells or 3 % of the revenues the Company receives from its sublicensees for their sale of licensed products. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 258,000 and $ 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 519,000 and $ 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decline in the royalty expense was primarily due to the expiration of patents relating to the licensed products, as specified in the 1997 Amended License Agreement. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred from Princeton to the University of Michigan (Michigan) and the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include Michigan as a party to that agreement. Also in connection with the transfer, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement with USC under which the Company continues to fund organic electronics research being conducted by Professors Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years . The Company makes payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of September 30, 2021, the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 4.5 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement of $ 384,000 and $ 309,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 1.1 million and $ 890,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 16 10. EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2021. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2021 or 2020. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. On February 23, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to OMM, at the new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by OMM for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements and regulatory approvals are expected to be completed in the next 12 months and operations are scheduled to commence by mid-year 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 789,000 and $ 821,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 3.0 million and $ 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 11.

Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company granted 74,086 performance units, of which 39,291 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 34,795 units are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and which will vest over the terms described below. The grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 16.5 million for the nine 19 months ended September 30, 2021, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.8 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 476,000 and $ 323,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 292,000 and $ 196,000 , respectively, related to performance units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 3.8 million and $ 3.2 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.0 million and $ 826,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 624,000 and $ 491,000 , respectively, related to performance units. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, 3,881 and 12,877 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 875,000 and $ 1.9 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued 6,508 and 7,702 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 1.1 million and $ 869,000 , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded charges of $ 20,000 and $ 21,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 46,000 and $ 34,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 25,000 and $ 29,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded charges of $ 78,000 and $ 81,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 140,000 and $ 107,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 86,000 and $ 85,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 14. SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of September 30, 2021, there were seven participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. 20 The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Service cost $ 419 $ 273 $ 1,276 $ 819 Interest cost 291 321 874 963 Amortization of prior service cost 275 275 824 824 Amortization of loss 1,234 545 3,702 1,636 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 2,219 $ 1,414 $ 6,676 $ 4,242 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 9 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 9 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 10) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 28.4 million and $ 13.7 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s material sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s 21 resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 16. CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended September 30, % of Total Revenue for the Nine Months Ended September 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2021 2020 2021 2020 September 30, 2021 A 50 % 41 % 46 % 38 % $ 10,129 B 27 % 28 % 25 % 28 % $ 23,786 C 7 % 14 % 14 % 17 % $ 33,520 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % of consolidated revenue for both three-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, and approximately 97 % and 96 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Country 2021 2020 2021 2020 South Korea $ 95,741 $ 66,667 $ 250,040 $ 167,154 China 41,323 43,569 138,135 101,911 Japan 1,911 2,279 5,227 6,263 Other non-U.S. locations 537 663 2,257 1,475 Total non-U.S. locations 139,512 113,178 395,659 276,803 United States 4,106 3,901 11,619 10,521 Total revenue $ 143,618 $ 117,079 $ 407,278 $ 287,324 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 United States $ 109,461 $ 93,230 Other 9,527 8,883 Total long-lived assets $ 118,988 $ 102,113 22 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 10. 17. INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 20.2 % and 18.5 % for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 19.4 % and 17.9 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The discrepancy between the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is primarily due to the benefit of income taxed in foreign jurisdictions partially offset by nondeductible employee compensation and U.S. international tax (GILTI and Subpart F). The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 11.7 million and $ 9.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 33.4 million and $ 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, in October 2021, a tax refund request on behalf of Universal Display Corporation was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for over-withheld taxes from 2018 to the second quarter of 2021. The Company has been advised by a leading Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 49.9 million and $ 40.1 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a long-term liability of $ 42.5 million and $ 32.7 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the KNTS on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlying intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled entirely in the favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue and the ruling was affirmed by the Korean High Court in August 2021. However, the KNTS has decided to appeal the ruling to the Korean Supreme Court. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2017 to 2020 are open and subject to examination. The State of New Jersey is currently auditing the 2014 to 2017 tax returns of UDC, Inc. The state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. 18. REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. 23 For both three-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded 97 % of its revenue from OLED related sales, and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded 97 % and 96 % of its revenue from OLED related sales, respectively, and 3 % and 4 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of September 30, 2021 Accounts receivable $ 96,235 Short-term unbilled receivables 27,491 Long-term unbilled receivables — Short-term deferred revenue 123,475 Long-term deferred revenue 43,458 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at September 30, 2021 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had $ 11.8 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, are as follows (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 145,535 Increases due to cash received — ( 160,021 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 9,854 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 24,209 Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 7,147 ) — Net change 17,062 ( 4,632 ) Balance at September 30, 2021 $ 27,491 $ ( 166,933 ) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 97,556 Increases due to cash received — ( 144,200 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 1,458 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 13,494 — Net change 13,494 ( 45,186 ) Balance at September 30, 2020 $ 14,856 $ ( 190,048 ) Unbilled receivables increased by $ 17.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to a contractual amendment with an existing customer that revised the payment terms of royalty consideration in which the minimum royalty payment amount due is known prior to a fiscal period end, but ancillary supporting billing information is delayed, necessitating postponement of the issuance of the invoice until such ancillary information has been confirmed. As such, payments due the Company are recorded as an unbilled receivable as opposed to accounts receivable until the final customer invoice can be generated. There was no impact on the ASC 606 revenue recognition process which requires periodic updating of estimated total contract consideration which is then allocated based on the total material sales anticipated over the life of the individual contracts. Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net increased $ 9.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to $ 1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in the cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was primarily due to a reduction in the 24 forecast of emitters to be procured over the contract life by one of the Company's customers that resulted from a change in their near-term production needs, as well as improved forecasted royalty consideration resulting from higher levels of current and anticipated customer sales of OLED products. 19. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 46,109 $ 40,500 $ 138,337 $ 79,470 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 255 ) ( 277 ) ( 857 ) ( 613 ) Adjusted net income $ 45,854 $ 40,223 $ 137,480 $ 78,857 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,291,192 47,227,061 47,286,927 47,182,625 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 400 339 769 1,263 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 70,983 32,931 67,887 28,772 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,362,575 47,260,331 47,355,583 47,212,660 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.97 $ 0.85 $ 2.91 $ 1.67 Diluted $ 0.97 $ 0.85 $ 2.90 $ 1.67 For both three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 25 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the sections entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as supplemented by disclosures in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. 26 At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, we entered into amendments of the OLED patent license agreement and the OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of September 30, 2021, Adesis employed a team of 118 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the 27 OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode (PHOLED) materials and technologies. In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. The new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. We anticipate the facility to be operational by mid-year 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: 28 Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continued to have an impact in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, it may potentially have a further adverse impact on our results of operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted for at least the fourth quarter of 2021, including as a result of: We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the remainder of the 2021 fiscal year. 29 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 75,609 $ 68,709 $ 6,900 Royalty and license fees 63,939 44,550 19,389 Contract research services 4,070 3,820 250 Total revenue 143,618 117,079 26,539 COST OF SALES 31,481 23,378 8,103 Gross margin 112,137 93,701 18,436 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 25,327 20,814 4,513 Selling, general and administrative 20,960 13,579 7,381 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,505 5,494 11 Patent costs 2,359 2,095 264 Royalty and license expense 258 3,293 (3,035 ) Total operating expenses 54,409 45,275 9,134 OPERATING INCOME 57,728 48,426 9,302 Interest income, net 137 1,029 (892 ) Other (loss) income, net (102 ) 262 (364 ) Interest and other income, net 35 1,291 (1,256 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 57,763 49,717 8,046 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (11,654 ) (9,217 ) (2,437 ) NET INCOME $ 46,109 $ 40,500 $ 5,609 Revenue Our total material sales were $75.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $68.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 10% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 20%. The increase in material sales was due to strengthened demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $63.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to $44.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 44%. This increase was primarily due to an overall strengthening of our customers’ sales of royalty-bearing OLED licensed products. In addition, there was an increase in the cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net arising from a reduction in the forecast of emitters to be procured over the contract life by one of our customers that resulted from a change in their near-term production needs, as well as improved forecasted royalty consideration resulting from higher levels of current and anticipated customer sales of OLED products. Contract research services revenue was $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 7%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2021 increased by $8.1 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 was an increase in inventory reserve of $1.0 million and $198,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees, gross margin for the 30 three months ended September 30, 2021 increased by $23.8 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 78% from 80%. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the increase in costs associated with the introduction of new red and green emitters to our customers. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $25.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $20.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including those associated with OVJP technology development, increased contract research, and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $21.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses, increased pre-production costs associated with the new manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland, as well as an increase in depreciation expenses resulting from corporate expansion. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both three-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The results in the current quarter reflected higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $258,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other (loss) income, net Interest income, net was $137,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current year over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2020. Other (loss) income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $102,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to other income, net of $262,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 20.2% and 18.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $11.7 million and $9.2 million, respectively, for those periods. 31 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 232,855 $ 167,211 $ 65,644 Royalty and license fees 163,037 110,008 53,029 Contract research services 11,386 10,105 1,281 Total revenue 407,278 287,324 119,954 COST OF SALES 82,748 58,480 24,268 Gross margin 324,530 228,844 95,686 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 72,733 61,708 11,025 Selling, general and administrative 57,603 45,129 12,474 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 16,490 16,474 16 Patent costs 6,003 5,591 412 Royalty and license expense 519 8,195 (7,676 ) Total operating expenses 153,348 137,097 16,251 OPERATING INCOME 171,182 91,747 79,435 Interest income, net 345 4,444 (4,099 ) Other income, net 178 634 (456 ) Interest and other income, net 523 5,078 (4,555 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 171,705 96,825 74,880 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (33,368 ) (17,355 ) (16,013 ) NET INCOME $ 138,337 $ 79,470 $ 58,867 Revenue Our total material sales were $232.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $167.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 39% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 41%. The increase in material sales was due to the recovery in sales that were adversely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as well as strengthened demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material. Even though we believe we have experienced the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain uncertain as to the possibility of its re-emergence and corresponding negative impact on OLED market demand. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $163.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to $110.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 48%. This increase was due primarily to an overall strengthening of our customers’ sales of royalty-bearing OLED licensed products. In addition, there was an increase in the cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net arising from a reduction in the forecast of emitters to be procured over the contract life by one of our customers that resulted from a change in their near-term production needs, as well as improved forecasted royalty consideration resulting from higher levels of current and anticipated customer sales of OLED products. Contract research services revenue was $11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to $10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 13%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 increased by $24.3 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 was an increase in inventory reserve of $2.1 million and $808,000, respectively, due to excess inventory 32 levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees, gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 increased by $95.7 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue remaining stable at 80%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $72.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $61.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including those associated with OVJP technology development, increased contract research, and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $57.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $45.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses, increased pre-production costs associated with the new manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland, as well as an increase in depreciation expenses resulting from corporate expansion. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $16.5 million for both nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The results in the current year reflected higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $519,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $345,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current year over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2020. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $178,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to $634,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 19.4% and 17.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $33.4 million and $17.4 million, respectively, for those periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of September 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $535.1 million and short-term investments of $253.8 million, for a total of $788.9 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $630.0 million and short-term investments of $100.0 million, for a total of $730.0 million, as of December 31, 2020. 33 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $134.3 million resulting from $138.3 million of net income and $94.1 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $98.1 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $160.0 million and an increase in other liabilities of $30.5 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $47.1 million, an increase in inventory of $32.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $14.0 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.3 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $75.8 million resulting from $79.5 million of net income and $61.8 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $65.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $144.2 million and an increase in other liabilities of $8.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $38.9 million, an increase in inventory of $21.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $19.6 million and an increase in other assets of $11.5 million. Cash used in investing activities was $187.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $157.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to net sales of $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2021 was primarily due to improvements to our Ewing facilities in New Jersey. Cash used in financing activities was $42.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $34.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $7.1 million and an increase in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $587,000, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $267,000. Working capital was $874.9 million as of September 30, 2021, as compared to $759.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, an increase in inventory and an increase in other current assets, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. 34 Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHE R INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until 35 the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our material sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace.

(UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license the Company’s proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of June 30, 2021 and results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 7 In November 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UDC Ireland, OMM , was formed as an Ireland limited company. Based out of Shannon, Ireland, OMM was formed to increase the Company’s production capacity to meet market demand and diversify the manufacturing base due to evolving industry requirements. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. 8 Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement 9 provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, the Company entered into amendments of the OLED patent license agreement and the OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. On July 21, 2021, the Tianma patent license and material purchase agreements expired. The parties are currently working to complete long-term extensions to both agreements. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. 10 Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets primarily relate to the Adesis acquisition and are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. 11 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government bonds, corporate bonds and convertible notes. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value June 30, 2021 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 167,339 $ — $ — $ 167,339 Money market accounts 16,588 — — 16,588 U.S. Government bonds 358,991 — ( 4 ) 358,987 $ 542,918 $ — $ ( 4 ) $ 542,914 December 31, 2020 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 163,779 $ — $ — $ 163,779 Money market accounts 17,261 — — 17,261 U.S. Government bonds 448,970 6 ( 4 ) 448,972 $ 630,010 $ 6 $ ( 4 ) $ 630,012 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value June 30, 2021 Certificates of deposit $ 720 $ — $ — $ 720 Corporate bonds 189,789 41 ( 10 ) 189,820 $ 190,509 $ 41 $ ( 10 ) $ 190,540 December 31, 2020 U.S. Government bonds $ 99,929 $ 67 $ — $ 99,996 $ 99,929 $ 67 $ — $ 99,996 Minority Investments and Convertible Notes The Company’s portfolio of minority investments and convertible notes consist of investments in privately held early-stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company does not obtain representation on the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. Minority investments and convertible notes are included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had two minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 8.0 million accounted for as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had one convertible note investment with a fair value of $ 500,000 accounted for as an available-for-sale debt security with a level 3 fair value measurement. 12 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2021 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of June 30, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 375,575 $ 375,575 $ — $ — Short-term investments 190,540 190,540 — — Convertible notes 500 — — 500 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 466,233 $ 466,233 $ — $ — Short-term investments 99,996 99,996 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of June 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020. 5. INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Raw materials $ 62,011 $ 46,843 Work-in-process 8,052 9,904 Finished goods 34,590 34,844 Inventory $ 104,653 $ 91,591 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $ 450,000 and none for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 1.1 million and $ 611,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. 13 6.

LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of June 30, 2021, the Company did not have any finance leases and had one operating lease that had not yet commenced, related to expansion of the Adesis research facilities in Wilmington, Delaware. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 757 $ 535 $ 1,372 $ 1,072 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 5,351 $ — $ 10,071 $ — 15 The following table presents the Company’s operating right-of-use assets and liabilities (in thousands): June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Right-of-use assets $ 16,633 $ 8,750 Short-term lease liabilities 2,004 1,871 Long-term lease liabilities 14,629 6,879 The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: June 30, 2021 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.7 Weighted average discount rate 3.3 % As of June 30, 2021, current operating leases had remaining terms between three months and ten years with options to extend the lease terms. Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of June 30, 2021, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2021 (1) $ 1,128 2022 2,578 2023 2,460 2024 2,306 2025 2,121 Thereafter 8,146 Total lease payments 18,739 Less: Imputed interest ( 2,106 ) Present value of lease payments $ 16,633 (1) Scheduled maturities of lease liabilities represent the period from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. 9 . RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company has long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC), dating back to 1994, for the conduct of research relating to the Company’s OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials. This research had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Stephen R. Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Mark E. Thompson. Under an Amended License Agreement entered into in 1997 by the Company, Princeton and USC (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), Princeton and USC granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by Princeton and USC for the Company. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company pays Princeton royalties of 3 % of the net sales price for licensed products it sells or 3 % of the revenues the Company receives from its sublicensees for their sale of licensed products. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 149,000 and $ 1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 261,000 and $ 4.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decline in the royalty expense was primarily due to the expiration of patents relating to the licensed products, as specified in the Amended License Agreement. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred from Princeton to the University of Michigan (Michigan) and the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include Michigan as a party to that agreement. Also in connection with the transfer, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement with USC under which the Company continues to fund organic electronics research being conducted by Professors Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years . 16 The Company make s payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of June 30 , 202 1 , the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 4.9 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement of $ 394,000 and $ 304,000 for the three months ended June 30 , 202 1 and 20 20 , respectively , and $ 679,000 and $ 581,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively . 10 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2021. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three or six months ended June 30, 2021 or 2020. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. On February 23, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to OMM, at the new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by OMM for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements and regulatory approvals are expected to be completed in the next 12 months and operations are scheduled to commence by mid-year 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 738,000 and $ 836,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 2.2 million and $ 1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 1 1 . SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors.

In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. 17 Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had issued 49,054,059 shares of common stock, of which 47,688,411 were outstanding.

(2) Refer to Note 14: Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . 1 3 . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Company’s Human Capital Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through June 30, 2021, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024. As of June 30, 2021, there were 1,828,424 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company granted 100,929 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 22.9 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 4.1 million and $ 3.8 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.3 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 711,000 and $ 492,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 7.7 million and $ 7.1 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 2.5 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 1.3 million and $ 892,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, 14,660 and 54,332 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 3.4 million and $ 7.4 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, 60,827 and 78,806 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 12.1 million and $ 11.3 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 76,000 and $ 156,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each 19 reporting period, research and development expe nse of $ 112,000 for both six-month periods . The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 297,000 and $ 299,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 591,000 and $ 596,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 2,706 and 3,228 shares, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company granted 69,586 performance units, of which 34,791 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 34,795 units are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and which will vest over the terms described below. The grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 15.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 2.2 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 596,000 and $ 301,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 366,000 and $ 183,000 , respectively, related to performance units. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 2.0 million and $ 1.9 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 539,000 and $ 503,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 332,000 and $ 296,000 , respectively, related to performance units. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, 3,881 and 12,877 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 875,000 and $ 1.9 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. 20 During the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued 4,105 and 5,467 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 787,000 and $ 590,000 , respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded charges of $ 35,000 and $ 37,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 58,000 and $ 44,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 36,000 and $ 37,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded charges of $ 58,000 and $ 59,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 95,000 and $ 72,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 60,000 and $ 56,000 , respectively to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 1 4 . SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of June 30, 2021, there were seven participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Service cost $ 429 $ 273 $ 857 $ 546 Interest cost 292 321 583 642 Amortization of prior service cost 274 274 549 549 Amortization of loss 1,234 546 2,468 1,091 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 2,229 $ 1,414 $ 4,457 $ 2,828 1 5 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 9 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 9 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 10) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 24.6 million and $ 13.7 million, respectively. 21 Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s material sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 1 6 . CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended June 30, % of Total Revenue for the Six Months Ended June 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2021 2020 2021 2020 June 30, 2021 A 51 % 28 % 43 % 36 % $ 15,619 B 26 % 34 % 24 % 28 % $ 38,101 C 15 % 13 % 18 % 19 % $ 5,955 22 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % and 93 % of consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and approximately 97 % and 96 % for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Country 2021 2020 2021 2020 South Korea $ 86,324 $ 31,062 $ 154,299 $ 100,487 China 36,308 20,508 96,812 58,342 Japan 2,001 2,197 3,316 3,984 Other non-U.S. locations 895 315 1,720 812 Total non-U.S. locations 125,528 54,082 256,147 163,625 United States 4,132 3,886 7,513 6,620 Total revenue $ 129,660 $ 57,968 $ 263,660 $ 170,245 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 United States $ 104,692 $ 93,230 Other 8,495 8,883 Total long-lived assets $ 113,187 $ 102,113 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 10. 1 7 . INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 19.2 % and a benefit of 222.1 % for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and an expense of 19.1 % and 17.3 % for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 9.7 million and a benefit of $ 562,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and an expense of $ 21.7 million and $ 8.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, the Company has decided that it will litigate the Korean withholding taxes paid or withheld on the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 46.6 million and $ 40.1 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a long-term liability of $ 39.2 million and $ 32.7 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. 23 On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlying intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled entirely in the favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue. However, the KNTS has decided to appeal the ruling to the Korean High Court. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2017 to 2020 are open and subject to examination. The State of New Jersey is currently auditing the 2014 to 2017 tax returns of UDC, Inc. The state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. 1 8 . REVENUE RECOGNITION: Effective on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded 97 % and 94 % of its revenue from OLED related sales, respectively, and 3 % and 6 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded 97 % and 96 % of its revenue from OLED related sales, respectively, and 3 % and 4 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of June 30, 2021 Accounts receivable $ 99,629 Short-term unbilled receivables 29,357 Long-term unbilled receivables 100 Short-term deferred revenue 122,978 Long-term deferred revenue 46,174 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at June 30, 2021 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $ 27.2 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, are as follows (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 81,458 Increases due to cash received — ( 92,816 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 4,507 Unbilled receivables recognized 25,028 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 6,000 ) — Net change 19,028 ( 6,851 ) Balance at June 30, 2021 $ 29,457 $ ( 169,152 ) 24 Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 48,249 Increases due to cash received — ( 75,683 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 829 Unbilled receivables recognized 9,566 — Net change 9,566 ( 26,605 ) Balance at June 30, 2020 $ 10,928 $ ( 171,467 ) 1 9 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 40,541 $ 815 $ 92,228 $ 38,970 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 247 ) ( 6 ) ( 602 ) ( 318 ) Adjusted net income $ 40,294 $ 809 $ 91,626 $ 38,652 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,299,627 47,227,294 47,284,773 47,160,163 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 204 483 369 924 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 57,033 16,214 62,454 29,418 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,356,864 47,243,991 47,347,596 47,190,505 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.85 $ 0.02 $ 1.94 $ 0.82 Diluted $ 0.85 $ 0.02 $ 1.94 $ 0.82 For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of none and 52,933 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the combined effects of unvested stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of none and 30,785 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 25 ITEM 2.

Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and • contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly 26 installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, we entered into amendments of the OLED patent license agreement and the OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. On July 21, 2021, the Tianma patent license and material purchase agreements expired. The parties are currently working to complete long-term extensions to both agreements. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of June 30, 2021, Adesis employed a team of 114 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. 27 In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. The new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. We anticipate the facility to be operational by mid-year 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continued to have an impact in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, it may potentially have a further adverse impact on our results of operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted for at least the second half of 2021, including as a result of: • temporary closure of electronics and other retail stores through which our customers sell the products for which they use our technology and materials; • consumer confidence and consumer spending habits, including spending for the products that our customers sell and negative trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels; • possible disruption to the supply chain caused by distribution and other logistical issues, which may impact suppliers of our raw materials as well as our ability to ship our materials to customers on a timely basis; • decreased productivity due to travel ban, work-from-home policies or shelter-in-place orders; • a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and uncertain global economic outlook or a credit crisis; and • uncertain trade restrictions amongst jurisdictions seeking to manage their respective exposure to risks, including the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, 28 including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the remainder of the 202 1 fiscal year. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 77,438 $ 31,927 $ 45,511 Royalty and license fees 48,212 22,380 25,832 Contract research services 4,010 3,661 349 Total revenue 129,660 57,968 71,692 COST OF SALES 27,969 12,643 15,326 Gross margin 101,691 45,325 56,366 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 24,101 21,397 2,704 Selling, general and administrative 20,239 16,147 4,092 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,497 5,490 7 Patent costs 1,809 1,858 (49 ) Royalty and license expense 149 1,618 (1,469 ) Total operating expenses 51,795 46,510 5,285 OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) 49,896 (1,185 ) 51,081 Interest income, net 75 1,268 (1,193 ) Other income, net 221 170 51 Interest and other income, net 296 1,438 (1,142 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 50,192 253 49,939 INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT (9,651 ) 562 (10,213 ) NET INCOME $ 40,541 $ 815 $ 39,726 Revenue Our total material sales were $77.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $31.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of 143% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 145%. The increase in material sales was due to strengthened demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material, as well as the recovery in sales that were adversely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Even though we believe we have experienced the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain uncertain as to the possibility of its re-emergence and corresponding negative impact on OLED market demand. • Green emitter sales for the three months ended June 30, 2021, which include our yellow-green emitters, were $57.8 million as compared to $24.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, with unit material volumes increasing by 147%. • Red emitter sales for the three months ended June 30, 2021 were $19.5 million as compared to $7.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, with unit material volumes increasing by 140%. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $48.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to $22.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of 115%, as our customers’ sales of royalty bearing OLED licensed products strengthened, as well as an increase in unit material sales to our customers during the three months ended June 30, 2021. Contract research services revenue was $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to $3.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of 10%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. 29 Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2021 increased by $15.3 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was an increase in inventory reserve of $450,000 and none, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees, gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2021 increased by $56.4 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue remaining stable at 78%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $24.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $21.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $20.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $16.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both three-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Patent costs Patent costs decreased to $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The results in the current quarter reflected lower internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $149,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $75,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current year over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2020. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $221,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to $170,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 19.2% and a benefit of 222.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $9.7 million and a benefit of $562,000, respectively, for those periods. 30 Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30 , 202 1 and 20 20 Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 157,246 $ 98,502 $ 58,744 Royalty and license fees 99,098 65,458 33,640 Contract research services 7,316 6,285 1,031 Total revenue 263,660 170,245 93,415 COST OF SALES 51,267 35,102 16,165 Gross margin 212,393 135,143 77,250 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 47,406 40,894 6,512 Selling, general and administrative 36,643 31,550 5,093 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 10,985 10,980 5 Patent costs 3,644 3,496 148 Royalty and license expense 261 4,902 (4,641 ) Total operating expenses 98,939 91,822 7,117 OPERATING INCOME 113,454 43,321 70,133 Interest income, net 208 3,415 (3,207 ) Other income, net 280 372 (92 ) Interest and other income, net 488 3,787 (3,299 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 113,942 47,108 66,834 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (21,714 ) (8,138 ) (13,576 ) NET INCOME $ 92,228 $ 38,970 $ 53,258 Revenue Our total material sales were $157.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $98.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of 60% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 56%. The increase in material sales was due to strengthened demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material, as well as the recovery in sales that were adversely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2020. Even though we believe we have experienced the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain uncertain as to the possibility of its re-emergence and corresponding negative impact on OLED market demand. • Green emitter sales for the six months ended June 30, 2021, which include our yellow-green emitters, were $118.4 million as compared to $76.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, with unit material volumes increasing by 54%. • Red emitter sales for the six months ended June 30, 2021 were $38.6 million as compared to $21.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, with unit material volumes increasing by 63%. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $99.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to $65.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of 51%, as our customers’ sales of royalty bearing OLED licensed products strengthened, as well as an increase in unit material sales to our customers during the six months ended June 30, 2021. Contract research services revenue was $7.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to $6.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of 16%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased by $16.2 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was an increase in inventory reserve of $1.1 million and $611,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees, gross margin for the six months ended 31 June 30 , 20 2 1 in creased by $ 77.3 million as compared to the six months ended June 30 , 20 20 , with gross margin as a percentage of revenue in creasing to 8 1 % from 79 %. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $47.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $40.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $36.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $31.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $11.0 million for both six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $3.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The results in the current year reflected higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $261,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $4.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $208,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current year over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2020. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $280,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to $372,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2020. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 19.1% and 17.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $21.7 million and $8.1 million, respectively, for those periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of June 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $542.9 million and short-term investments of $190.6 million, for a total of $733.5 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $630.0 million and short-term investments of $100.0 million, for a total of $730.0 million, as of December 31, 2020. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was $59.1 million resulting from $92.2 million of net income and $35.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $68.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $92.8 million and an increase in other liabilities of $11.9 32 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $20.7 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $17.4 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $ 17. 0 million and an increase in inventory of $1 4 . 2 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $32.0 million resulting from $39.0 million of net income and $20.0 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $27.0 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $75.7 million and a decrease in other liabilities of $5.8 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $21.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $20.4 million, an increase in other assets of $11.9 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $8.0 million. Cash used in investing activities was $115.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $94.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to net sales of $8.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, and an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $9.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2021 was primarily due to improvements to our Ewing facilities in New Jersey. Cash used in financing activities was $31.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $26.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $4.8 million, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $197,000 and a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $147,000. Working capital was $830.3 million as of June 30, 2021, as compared to $759.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, an increase in other current assets, an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in deferred revenue. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. 33 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 30, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. 34 Below is a summar y of an active proceeding that ha s been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our material sales or licensing business or on our C onsolidated F inancial S tatements, including our C onsolidated S tatements of I ncome, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involve s an issued patent that relate s to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace.

BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license the Company’s proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2021 and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 6 In November 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UDC Ireland, OMM , was formed as an Ireland limited company. Based out of Shannon, Ireland, OMM was formed to increase the Company’s production capacity to meet market demand and diversify the manufacturing base due to evolving industry requirements. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. 7 Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent 8 portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, the Company entered into amendments of the OLED patent license agreement and the OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. 9 Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets relate to the Adesis acquisition and the Irish EPA license acquisition and are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. 10 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government bonds and convertible notes. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value March 31, 2021 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 160,850 $ — $ — $ 160,850 Money market accounts 16,438 — — 16,438 U.S. Government bonds 548,997 — ( 6 ) 548,991 $ 726,285 $ — $ ( 6 ) $ 726,279 December 31, 2020 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 163,779 $ — $ — $ 163,779 Money market accounts 17,261 — — 17,261 U.S. Government bonds 448,970 6 ( 4 ) 448,972 $ 630,010 $ 6 $ ( 4 ) $ 630,012 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value March 31, 2021 Certificates of deposit $ 720 $ — $ — $ 720 $ 720 $ — $ — $ 720 December 31, 2020 U.S. Government bonds $ 99,929 $ 67 $ — $ 99,996 $ 99,929 $ 67 $ — $ 99,996 Minority Investments and Convertible Notes The Company’s portfolio of minority investments and convertible notes consist of investments in privately held early-stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company does not obtain representation on the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. Minority investments and convertible notes are included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had two minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 8.0 million accounted for as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had one convertible note investment with a fair value of $ 500,000 accounted for as an available-for-sale debt security with a level 3 fair value measurement. 11 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2021 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of March 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 548,991 $ 548,991 $ — $ — Short-term investments 720 720 — — Convertible notes 500 — — 500 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 466,233 $ 466,233 $ — $ — Short-term investments 99,996 99,996 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of March 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. 5.

LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of March 31, 2021, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 615 $ 537 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 4,720 $ — 14 The following table presents the Company’s operating right-of-use assets and liabilities (in thousands): March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Right-of-use assets $ 12,819 $ 8,750 Short-term lease liabilities 2,324 1,871 Long-term lease liabilities 10,495 6,879 The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: March 31, 2021 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.3 Weighted average discount rate 3.4 % As of March 31, 2021, current operating leases had remaining terms between two and eight years with options to extend the lease terms. Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of March 31, 2021, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2021 (1) $ 1,987 2022 2,541 2023 1,652 2024 1,474 2025 1,263 Thereafter 5,520 Total lease payments 14,437 Less: Imputed interest ( 1,618 ) Present value of lease payments $ 12,819 (1) Scheduled maturities of lease liabilities represent the time-period of April 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. 9 . RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company has long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC), dating back to 1994, for the conduct of research relating to the Company’s OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials. This research had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Stephen R. Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Mark E. Thompson. Under an Amended License Agreement entered into in 1997 by the Company, Princeton and USC (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), Princeton and USC granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by Princeton and USC for the Company. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company pays Princeton royalties of 3 % of the net sales price for licensed products it sells or 3 % of the revenues the Company receives from its sublicensees for their sale of licensed products. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 112,000 and $ 3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. The decline in the royalty expense was primarily due to the expiration of patents relating to the licensed products, as specified in the Amended License Agreement. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred from Princeton to the University of Michigan (Michigan) and the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include Michigan as a party to that agreement. Also in connection with the transfer, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement with USC under which the Company continues to fund organic electronics research being conducted by Professors Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years . 15 The Company make s payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of March 31 , 202 1 , the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 6.6 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement of $ 285,000 and $ 272,000 for the three months ended March 3 1 , 202 1 and 20 20 , respectively . 10 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2021. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three months ended March 31, 2021 or 2020. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. On February 23, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to OMM, at the new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by OMM for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements and regulatory approvals are expected to be completed in the next 12 months and operations are scheduled to commence in early 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 1.5 million and $ 473,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 1 1 . SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. 16 Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had issued 49,050,776 shares of common stock, of which 47,685,128 were outstanding. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased no shares of common stock. Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted a total of 1,400 and 1,926 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value of shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both three-month periods. Dividends During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.20 per common share, or $ 9.5 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On May 4, 2021 , the Company’s Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $ 0.20 per common share to be paid on June 30, 2021 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2021 . All future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. 1 2 .

(2) Refer to Note 14: Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . 17 1 3 . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through March 31, 2021, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024. As of March 31, 2021, there were 1,828,661 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company granted 100,079 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 22.7 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 3.6 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.2 million and $ 877,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 557,000 and $ 400,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, 48,824 and 24,474 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 9.4 million and $ 3.9 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 36,000 and credit of $ 43,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 294,000 and $ 297,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 1,353 and 1,614 shares, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company granted 69,586 performance units, of which 34,791 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 34,795 units are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and which will vest over the terms described below. The weighted average grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 15.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. 18 For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a selling, general and administrative credit of $ 211,000 and $ 811,000 , respectively, research and development credit of $ 56,000 and $ 202,000 , respectively, and cost of sales credit of $ 35,000 and $ 113,000 , respectively, related to performance units. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, 1,224 and 5,963 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 231,000 and $ 930,000 , respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued 1,782 and 2,315 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 348,000 and $ 259,000 , respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded charges of $ 23,000 and $ 22,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 36,000 and $ 28,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 25,000 and $ 19,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 1 4 . SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of March 31, 2021, there were seven participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Service cost $ 428 $ 273 Interest cost 291 321 Amortization of prior service cost 275 275 Amortization of loss 1,234 545 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 2,228 $ 1,414 19 1 5 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 9 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 9 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 10) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 18.9 million and $ 13.7 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s material sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. 20 The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 1 6 . CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended March 31, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2021 2020 March 31, 2021 A 36 % 41 % $ 6,204 B 23 % 25 % $ 20,769 C 20 % 23 % $ 22,802 D 12 % 7 % $ 17,740 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % and 98 % of consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, Country 2021 2020 South Korea $ 67,975 $ 69,425 China 60,504 37,834 Japan 1,315 1,787 Other non-U.S. locations 825 497 Total non-U.S. locations 130,619 109,543 United States 3,381 2,734 Total revenue $ 134,000 $ 112,277 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 United States $ 99,678 $ 93,230 Other 8,137 8,883 Total long-lived assets $ 107,815 $ 102,113 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 10. 1 7 . INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 18.9 % and 18.6 % for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 12.1 million and $ 8.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 21 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment , management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, the Company has decided to litigate the Korean withholding taxes paid or withheld on the 2018, 2019 and 2020 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 43.4 million and $ 40.1 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a long-term liability of $ 35.9 million and $ 32.7 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled entirely in the favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue. However, the KNTS has decided to appeal the ruling to the Korean High Court. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2017 to 2020 are open and subject to examination. The State of New Jersey is currently auditing the 2014 to 2017 tax returns of UDC, Inc. The state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. 1 8 . REVENUE RECOGNITION: Effective on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. For both three-month periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded 98 % of its revenue from sales of material and 2 % from the providing of services through Adesis. 22 Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of March 31, 2021 Accounts receivable $ 91,327 Short-term unbilled receivables 24,900 Long-term unbilled receivables — Short-term deferred revenue 128,546 Long-term deferred revenue 49,578 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at March 31, 2021 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had $ 19.4 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 33,439 Increases due to cash received — ( 53,000 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 3,738 Unbilled receivables recognized 20,471 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 6,000 ) — Net change 14,471 ( 15,823 ) Balance at March 31, 2021 $ 24,900 $ ( 178,124 ) Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 38,749 Increases due to cash received — ( 43,685 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 367 Unbilled receivables recognized 1,395 — Net change 1,395 ( 4,569 ) Balance at March 31, 2020 $ 2,757 $ ( 149,431 ) 1 9 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. 23 For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the E mployee Stock Purchase Plan . The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 51,687 $ 38,155 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 358 ) ( 339 ) Adjusted net income $ 51,329 $ 37,816 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,267,921 47,093,033 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 165 441 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 61,618 29,355 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,329,704 47,122,829 Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.09 $ 0.80 Diluted $ 1.08 $ 0.80 For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of none and 14,112 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 24 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships.

Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and • contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly 25 installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, we entered into amendments of the OLED patent license agreement and the OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of March 31, 2021, Adesis employed a team of 104 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. 26 In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. The new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. We anticipate the facility to be operational by early 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continued to have an impact in the three months ended March 31, 2021. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, it may potentially have a further adverse impact on our results of operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted for at least the first half of 2021, including as a result of: • temporary closure of electronics and other retail stores through which our customers sell the products for which they use our technology and materials; • consumer confidence and consumer spending habits, including spending for the products that our customers sell and negative trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels; • possible disruption to the supply chain caused by distribution and other logistical issues, which may impact suppliers of our raw materials as well as our ability to ship our materials to customers on a timely basis; • decreased productivity due to travel ban, work-from-home policies or shelter-in-place orders; • a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and uncertain global economic outlook or a credit crisis; and • uncertain trade restrictions amongst jurisdictions seeking to manage their respective exposure to risks, including the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, 27 including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the remainder of the 202 1 fiscal year. Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE: Material sales $ 79,808 $ 66,575 $ 13,233 Royalty and license fees 50,886 43,078 7,808 Contract research services 3,306 2,624 682 Total revenue 134,000 112,277 21,723 COST OF SALES 23,298 22,459 839 Gross margin 110,702 89,818 20,884 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 23,305 19,497 3,808 Selling, general and administrative 16,404 15,403 1,001 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,488 5,490 (2 ) Patent costs 1,835 1,638 197 Royalty and license expense 112 3,284 (3,172 ) Total operating expenses 47,144 45,312 1,832 OPERATING INCOME 63,558 44,506 19,052 Interest income, net 133 2,147 (2,014 ) Other income, net 59 202 (143 ) Interest and other income, net 192 2,349 (2,157 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 63,750 46,855 16,895 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (12,063 ) (8,700 ) (3,363 ) NET INCOME $ 51,687 $ 38,155 $ 13,532 Revenue Our total material sales were $79.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $66.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of 20% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 13%. The increase in material sales was due to increased demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material as the global economy continued to improve during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Even though we believe we have experienced the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain uncertain as to the possibility of its re-emergence and corresponding negative impact on OLED market demand. • Green emitter sales for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which include our yellow-green emitters, were $60.5 million as compared to $52.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, with unit material volumes increasing by 11%. • Red emitter sales for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $19.1 million as compared to $13.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, with unit material volumes increasing by 21%. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $50.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to $43.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of 18%, as our customer’s sales of royalty bearing OLED licensed products strengthened during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Contract research services revenue was $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of 26%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2021 increased by $839,000 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, was an increase in inventory reserve of $667,000 and $611,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain 28 products. As a result of the increase in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees , gross margin for the three months ended March 3 1 , 20 2 1 in creased by $ 20.9 million as compared to the three months ended March 3 1 , 20 20 , with gross margin as a percentage of revenue in creasing to 8 3 % from 8 0 %. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $23.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $19.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $16.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $15.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both three-month periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The results in the current year reflected higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $112,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $133,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current year over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2020. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $59,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to $202,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 18.9% and 18.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $12.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively, for those periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of March 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $726.3 million and short-term investments of $720,000, for a total of $727.0 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $630.0 million and short-term investments of $100.0 million, for a total of $730.0 million, as of December 31, 2020. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $29.5 million resulting from $51.7 million of net income and $16.8 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $39.0 million reduction due 29 to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $ 53.0 million a n d an in crease in other liabilities of $ 6 . 3 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $21.1 million, an increase in inventory of $10.5 million , an increase in accounts receivable of $9. 1 million and an increase in other assets of $1.8 million . Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $5.7 million resulting from $38.2 million of net income, partially offset by a $24.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, and a $8.0 million reduction due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $29.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $22.2 million and an increase in inventory of $10.7 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $43.7 million, an increase in other liabilities of $6.1 million and a decrease in other assets of $4.4 million. Cash provided by investing activities was $85.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $97.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales of $95.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared $101.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2021 was primarily due to improvements to our Ewing facilities in New Jersey. Cash used in financing activities was $18.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to $11.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was due to an increase the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $4.8 million and an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $2.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $89,000. Working capital was $793.0 million as of March 31, 2021, as compared to $759.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments and an increase in deferred revenue. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. 30 Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of March 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the 31 outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our material sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace.

BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company's technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license the Company’s proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2020 and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC and OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corp was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of the Company’s proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. 7 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. 8 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these 9 agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. 10 Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment , eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2017-04, beginning on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments: Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which requires measurement and recognition of expected losses for financial assets held. The new standard changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including debt investments and trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new-forward looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require organizations to incorporate considerations of historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-13, beginning on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 11 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit and U.S. Government bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value September 30, 2020 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 141,435 $ — $ — $ 141,435 Money market accounts 21,185 — — 21,185 $ 162,620 $ — $ — $ 162,620 December 31, 2019 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 119,272 $ — $ — $ 119,272 Money market accounts 12,355 — — 12,355 $ 131,627 $ — $ — $ 131,627 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value September 30, 2020 Certificates of deposit $ 150 $ — $ — $ 150 U.S. Government bonds 509,262 636 — 509,898 $ 509,412 $ 636 $ — $ 510,048 December 31, 2019 Certificates of deposit $ 700 $ — $ — $ 700 U.S. Government bonds 513,577 190 ( 6 ) 513,761 $ 514,277 $ 190 $ ( 6 ) $ 514,461 Minority Investments The Company’s portfolio of minority investments consists of investments in privately held early stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company does not obtain representation on the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had one minority investment with a carrying value of $ 5.0 million accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2020 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of September 30, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 21,185 $ 21,185 $ — $ — Short-term investments 510,048 510,048 — — 12 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 201 9 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 12,355 $ 12,355 $ — $ — Short-term investments 514,461 514,461 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of September 30, 2020, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 537 $ 456 $ 1,609 $ 1,316 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ — $ 1,503 $ — $ 9,776 As of September 30, 2020, current operating leases had remaining terms between one and eight years with options to extend the lease terms and the Company had operating lease right-of-use assets of $ 7.2 million, current operating lease liabilities of $ 1.1 million and long-term operating lease liabilities of $ 6.1 million.

RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company has long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC), dating back to 1994, for the conduct of research relating to the Company’s OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials. This research had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Stephen R. Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Mark E. Thompson. Under an Amended License Agreement entered into in 1997 by the Company, Princeton and USC (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), Princeton and USC granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by Princeton and USC for the Company. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company pays Princeton royalties of 3 % of the net sales price for licensed products it sells or 3 % of the revenues the Company receives from its sublicensees for their sale of licensed products. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 3.3 million and $ 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 8.2 million and $ 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred from Princeton to the University of Michigan (Michigan) and the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include Michigan as a party to that agreement. Also in connection with the transfer, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement with USC under which the Company continues to fund organic electronics research being conducted by Professors Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years . The Company makes payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of September 30, 2020, the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 7.6 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement of $ 309,000 and $ 212,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 890,000 and $ 715,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 10 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2020. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. 16 Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2020 or 2019. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 821,000 and $ 580,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 2.1 million and $ 941,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 1 1 . SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had issued 49,008,915 shares of common stock, of which 47,643,267 were outstanding.

(2) Refer to Note 14: Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . 1 3 . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through September 30, 2020, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024. As of September 30, 2020, there were 2,007,080 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. 18 During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company granted 137,255 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 21.9 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 3.4 million and $ 2.2 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.2 million and $ 641,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 526,000 and $ 273,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 10.4 million and $ 7.1 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 3.2 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 1.4 million and $ 769,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, 7,199 and 7,416 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.4 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, 86,005 and 85,758 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 12.4 million and $ 14.0 million, respectively were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 123,000 and $ 54,000 , respectively.

The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 301,000 and $ 187,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 897,000 and $ 659,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 4,842 and 7,256 shares, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company granted 95,772 performance units, of which 47,885 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 47,887 units are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and which will vest over the terms described below. The weighted average grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.2 million and $ 289,000 , respectively, research and development expense of $ 323,000 and $ 70,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 196,000 and $ 34,000 , respectively, related to performance units.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company issued 7,702 and 5,852 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 869,000 and $ 658,000 , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded charges of $ 21,000 and $ 19,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 34,000 and $ 24,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 29,000 and $ 16,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded charges of $ 81,000 and $ 66,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 107,000 and $ 88,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 85,000 and $ 53,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 1 4 . SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of September 30, 2020, there were seven participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service cost $ 273 $ 227 $ 819 $ 742 Interest cost 321 403 963 1,209 Amortization of prior service cost 275 399 824 1,197 Amortization of loss 545 410 1,636 1,231 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,414 $ 1,439 $ 4,242 $ 4,379 20 1 5 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 9 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 9 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and two employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the officer and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 10) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 17.9 million and $ 22.0 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s materials sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under 21 European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 1 6 . CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended September 30, % of Total Revenue for the Nine Months Ended September 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2020 2019 2020 2019 September 30, 2020 A 41 % 56 % 38 % 45 % $ 22,138 B 28 % 21 % 28 % 24 % $ 15,308 C 14 % 12 % 17 % 17 % $ 33,266 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % of consolidated revenue for both three-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and approximately 96 % and 97 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Country 2020 2019 2020 2019 South Korea $ 66,667 $ 70,042 $ 167,154 $ 190,303 China 43,569 23,205 101,911 98,955 Japan 2,279 1,137 6,263 3,802 Other non-U.S. locations 663 539 1,475 1,718 Total non-U.S. locations 113,178 94,923 276,803 294,778 United States 3,901 2,592 10,521 8,670 Total revenue $ 117,079 $ 97,515 $ 287,324 $ 303,448 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 United States $ 88,476 $ 80,027 Other 8,354 7,845 Total long-lived assets $ 96,830 $ 87,872 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 10. 1 7 . INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 18.5 % and 15.3 % for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 17.9 % and 15.8 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 9.2 million and $ 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and an expense of $ 17.4 million and $ 21.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09 of $ 308,000 and $ 693,000 for the three months 22 ended September 30 , 20 20 and 201 9 , respectively , and $ 1.9 million and $ 3.5 mill ion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively . In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded related to the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, the Company has decided to litigate the Korean withholding taxes paid or withheld on the 2018, 2019 and 2020 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 36.7 million and $ 26.9 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a long-term liability of $ 35.5 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled entirely in the favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue. However, the KNTS has decided to appeal the ruling to the Korean High Court. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2016 to 2019 are open and subject to examination. The State of New Jersey is currently auditing the 2014 and 2017 tax returns of UDC, Inc. The State and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and ultimately upon settlement of these uncertain tax positions. 1 8 . REVENUE RECOGNITION: Effective on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a transaction with one of its customers for emitters involving elements of variable consideration. Due to the escalation in trade policy tension between the governments of China and the United States, the customer required a larger than normal shipment of emitters having a right to return them through March 15, 2020 in order to accommodate their uncertain production needs. Per Topic 606, the Company was constrained to recognizing revenue on this unique shipment to the extent that it was probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur and deferred recognition of the remainder until after the inherent uncertainties of the transaction were resolved. These uncertainties included factors that were outside of the Company’s influence, including the customer’s production needs and complexities associated with the current international health and trade issues in China. On March 15, 2020, the inherent uncertainties of the transaction were resolved as the customer did not exercise their right of return provision. This event resulted in the recognition of the previously constrained revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 23 For both three-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded 97 % of its revenue from sales of materials, respectively, and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded 96 % and 97 % of its revenue from sales of materials and 4 % and 3 %, respectively, from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of September 30, 2020 Accounts receivable $ 99,350 Short-term unbilled receivables 6,600 Long-term unbilled receivables 8,256 Short-term deferred revenue 138,391 Long-term deferred revenue 51,657 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at September 30, 2020 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. The significant customer contracts (individually representing greater than 10% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020) expire in 2022 . As of September 30, 2020, the Company had $ 13.8 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, are as follows (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 97,556 Increases due to cash received — ( 144,200 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 1,458 Unbilled receivables recognized 13,494 — Net change 13,494 ( 45,186 ) Balance at September 30, 2020 $ 14,856 $ ( 190,048 ) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ ( 122,567 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 94,044 Increases due to cash received — ( 113,849 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 689 Unbilled receivables recognized 7,571 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 1,225 ) — Net change 6,346 ( 19,116 ) Balance at September 30, 2019 $ 7,366 $ ( 141,683 ) 24 1 9 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 40,500 $ 36,962 $ 79,470 $ 111,876 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 277 ) ( 260 ) ( 613 ) ( 922 ) Adjusted net income $ 40,223 $ 36,702 $ 78,857 $ 110,954 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,227,061 46,980,439 47,182,625 46,947,109 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 339 249 1,263 1,142 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 32,931 33,231 28,772 35,650 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,260,331 47,013,919 47,212,660 46,983,901 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.85 $ 0.78 $ 1.67 $ 2.36 Diluted $ 0.85 $ 0.78 $ 1.67 $ 2.36 For both the three-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, there were no combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, there were no combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 25 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the sections entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2020, as supplemented by disclosures in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED), technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and • contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time control passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments 26 over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Visionox’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of September 30, 2020, Adesis employed a team of 97 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. 27 We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. Further, we continue to monitor the impact of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. We believe the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, and we expect the pandemic, as it evolves, to continue have an adverse impact on our results of operations in at least the near term, due in large part to the current disruption and uncertainties, potential continuing disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted for at least the balance of 2020, including as a result of: • temporary closure of electronics and other retail stores through which our customers sell the products for which they use our technology and materials; • consumer confidence and consumer spending habits, including spending for the products that our customers sell and negative trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels; • possible disruption to the supply chain caused by distribution and other logistical issues, which may impact suppliers of our raw materials as well as our ability to ship our materials to customers on a timely basis; • decreased productivity due to travel ban, work-from-home policies or shelter-in-place orders; • a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and uncertain global economic outlook or a credit crisis; and • uncertain trade restrictions amongst jurisdictions seeking to manage their respective exposure to risks, including the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the remainder of the 2020 fiscal year. 28 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 117,079 $ 97,515 $ 19,564 COST OF SALES 23,378 17,286 6,092 Gross margin 93,701 80,229 13,472 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 20,814 16,787 4,027 Selling, general and administrative 13,579 12,623 956 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,494 5,493 1 Patent costs 2,095 1,659 436 Royalty and license expense 3,293 2,837 456 Total operating expenses 45,275 39,399 5,876 OPERATING INCOME 48,426 40,830 7,596 Interest income, net 1,029 2,748 (1,719 ) Other income, net 262 53 209 Interest and other income, net 1,291 2,801 (1,510 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 49,717 43,631 6,086 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (9,217 ) (6,669 ) (2,548 ) NET INCOME $ 40,500 $ 36,962 $ 3,538 Revenue During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized revenue of $117.1 million, an increase of $19.6 million from $97.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in revenue was due to higher material sales as a result of stronger demand in the OLED display market. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 97% of total revenue for both three-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2020 increased by $6.1 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, was an increase in inventory reserve of $198,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in material sales, gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2020 increased by $13.5 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 80% from 82%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $20.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $16.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. 29 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both three-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The results in the current year quarter reflected higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current quarter over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2019. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $262,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to $53,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 18.5% and 15.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $9.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, without the $308,000 benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 19.2% and $9.5 million, respectively, and for the three months ended September 30, 2019, without the $693,000 benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 16.9% and $7.4 million, respectively. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 287,324 $ 303,448 $ (16,124 ) COST OF SALES 58,480 57,172 1,308 Gross margin 228,844 246,276 (17,432 ) OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 61,708 51,449 10,259 Selling, general and administrative 45,129 40,531 4,598 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 16,474 16,469 5 Patent costs 5,591 5,145 446 Royalty and license expense 8,195 8,828 (633 ) Total operating expenses 137,097 122,422 14,675 OPERATING INCOME 91,747 123,854 (32,107 ) Interest income, net 4,444 8,336 (3,892 ) Other income, net 634 740 (106 ) Interest and other income, net 5,078 9,076 (3,998 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 96,825 132,930 (36,105 ) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (17,355 ) (21,054 ) 3,699 NET INCOME $ 79,470 $ 111,876 $ (32,406 ) 30 Revenue During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized revenue of $287.3 million, a decrease of $16.1 million from the $303.4 million recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. We believe the decrease in revenue was mainly due to the weakened demand for emitter product from our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred in the three-month period ended June 30, 2020. Revenue increased to pre-COVID-19 levels during the three-month period ended September 30, 2020 as a result of stronger demand in the OLED display market. However, the full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our operational performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors including the timing, extent and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, and the impact on the global economy and demand for OLED consumer products. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 96% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to 97% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by $1.3 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, primarily due to an increase in manufacturing costs offset by a decrease in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, was an increase in inventory reserve of $808,000 and $4.2 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in manufacturing costs and decrease in material sales, gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 decreased by $17.4 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 80% from 81%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $61.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $51.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $45.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $16.5 million for both nine-month periods ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The results in the current year reflected higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current year over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2019. 31 Other income , net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income . We recorded other income , net of $ 634 ,000 for the nine months ended September 30 , 20 20 as comp ared to $ 740 ,000 for the nine months ended September 30 , 201 9 . Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 17.9% and 15.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $17.4 million and $21.1 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, without the $1.9 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 19.8% and $19.2 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, without the $3.5 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 18.5% and $24.6 million, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of September 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $162.6 million and short-term investments of $510.1 million, for a total of $672.7 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $131.6 million and short-term investments of $514.5, for a total of $646.1 million, as of December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $75.8 million resulting from $79.5 million of net income and $61.8 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $65.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $144.2 million and an increase in other liabilities of $8.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $38.9 million, an increase in inventory of $21.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $19.6 million and an increase in other assets of $11.5 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $137.7 million resulting from $111.9 million of net income and $88.3 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $62.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $113.8 million, a reduction of inventory of $8.1 million and an increase in other liabilities of $5.7 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $22.6 million, an increase in other assets of $14.9 million, and a reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.8 million. Cash used in investing activities was $10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $83.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales of $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to net purchases of $57.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2020 was primarily due to improvements to our Ewing facilities in New Jersey as part of our plan to expand operations during 2019. Cash used in financing activities was $34.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $30.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $7.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $1.6 million, a decrease in the repurchase of common stock of $649,000 and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $211,000. Working capital was $703.4 million as of September 30, 2020, as compared to $630.9 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and inventory, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and 32 short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2020. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in 33 the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 34 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS This section supplements and updates certain of the information found under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2020 based on information currently known to us and recent developments since the filing of such Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The matters discussed below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in such Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect it to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our operations and business. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, including any “second wave” of the pandemic that may occur in the fourth quarter of 2020, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees and communities, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, including working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel . In the future, we may face closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. In addition, many of our customers may reduce their operations, as demand for their products becomes negatively affected, which would adversely impact our revenues from these customers. As a result, we would expect our financial results to be materially adversely impacted. In addition, consumer spending generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impact of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales for our customers and may also have an impact on their development of new products. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees. This policy may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business, and have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its overall impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 2.

UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company's technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license the Company’s proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of June 30, 2020 and results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC and OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corp was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of the Company’s proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. 7 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. 8 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these 9 agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. 10 Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment , eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2017-04, beginning on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments: Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which requires measurement and recognition of expected losses for financial assets held. The new standard changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including debt investments and trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new-forward looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require organizations to incorporate considerations of historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-13, beginning on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 11 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit and U.S. Government bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value June 30, 2020 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 112,887 $ — $ — $ 112,887 Money market accounts 20,679 — — 20,679 $ 133,566 $ — $ — $ 133,566 December 31, 2019 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 119,272 $ — $ — $ 119,272 Money market accounts 12,355 — — 12,355 $ 131,627 $ — $ — $ 131,627 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value June 30, 2020 Certificates of deposit $ 700 $ 2 $ — $ 702 U.S. Government bonds 508,329 1,428 ( 4 ) 509,753 $ 509,029 $ 1,430 $ ( 4 ) $ 510,455 December 31, 2019 Certificates of deposit $ 700 $ — $ — $ 700 U.S. Government bonds 513,577 190 ( 6 ) 513,761 $ 514,277 $ 190 $ ( 6 ) $ 514,461 Minority Investments The Company’s portfolio of minority investments consists of investments in privately held early stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company does not obtain representation on the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had one minority investment with a carrying value of $ 5.0 million accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2020 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of June 30, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 20,679 $ 20,679 $ — $ — Short-term investments 510,455 510,455 — — 12 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 201 9 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 12,355 $ 12,355 $ — $ — Short-term investments 514,461 514,461 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of June 30, 2020 or December 31, 2019. 5. INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Raw materials $ 36,065 $ 25,920 Work-in-process 3,222 7,987 Finished goods 45,236 30,046 Inventory $ 84,523 $ 63,953 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of none and $ 3.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 611,000 and $ 4.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. 6.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of acquired technology and other intangible assets that include trade names, customer relationships and developed IP processes. 13 Acquired Technology Acquired technology consists of acquired license rights for patents and know-how obtained from PD-LD, Inc., Motorola, BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm. These intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 PD-LD, Inc. $ 1,481 $ 1,481 Motorola 15,909 15,909 BASF 95,989 95,989 Fujifilm 109,462 109,462 Other 426 401 223,267 223,242 Less: Accumulated amortization ( 142,758 ) ( 132,468 ) Acquired technology, net $ 80,509 $ 90,774 Amortization expense related to acquired technology was $ 5.1 million for both three-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and $ 10.3 million for both six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 10.3 million for the six months ending December 31, 2020, $ 20.6 million in the year ending December 31, 2021, $ 15.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2022, $ 9.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2023, $ 9.6 million in the year ending December 31, 2024 and $ 14.5 million in total thereafter. Fujifilm Patent Acquisition On July 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Patent Sale Agreement with Fujifilm. Under the agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $ 105.0 million, plus costs incurred in connection with the purchase. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The agreement permitted the Company to assign all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to its affiliates, and the Company assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement, its rights and obligations to UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. The Company recorded the $ 105.0 million plus $ 4.5 million of purchase costs as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition of, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of € 86.8 million ($ 95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of € 86.8 million ($ 95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $ 217,000 as acquired technology which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. 14 Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $ 16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $ 10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $ 4.8 million of internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $ 1.5 million assigned to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years. At June 30, 2020, these other intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2020 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Customer relationships $ 10,520 $ ( 3,598 ) $ 6,922 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 ( 1,267 ) 3,553 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 ( 593 ) 907 Total identifiable other intangible assets $ 16,840 $ ( 5,458 ) $ 11,382 Amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $ 345,000 for both three-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and $ 690,000 and $ 687,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 697,000 for the six months ending December 31, 2020, $ 1.4 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2021 through 2024, and $ 5.1 million in total thereafter. 8. LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 535 $ 430 $ 1,072 $ 860 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ — $ — $ — $ 8,273 As of June 30, 2020, current operating leases had remaining terms between one and eight years with options to extend the lease terms and the Company had operating lease right-of-use assets of $ 7.5 million, current operating lease liabilities of $ 1.2 million and long-term operating lease liabilities of $ 6.3 million. The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: June 30, 2020 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.3 Weighted average discount rate 5.5 % 15 Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of June 30, 2020, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2020 (1) $ 898 2021 1,252 2022 1,183 2023 1,044 2024 987 Thereafter 3,789 Total lease payments 9,153 Less: Imputed interest ( 1,630 ) Present value of lease payments $ 7,523 (1) Scheduled maturities of lease liabilities represent the time-period of July 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. 9 . RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company has long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC), dating back to 1994, for the conduct of research relating to the Company’s OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials. This research had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Stephen R. Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Mark E. Thompson. Under an Amended License Agreement entered into in 1997 by the Company, Princeton and USC (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), Princeton and USC granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by Princeton and USC for the Company. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company pays Princeton royalties of 3 % of the net sales price for licensed products it sells or 3 % of the revenues the Company receives from its sublicensees for their sale of licensed products. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 1.6 million and $ 3.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 4.9 million and $ 6.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred from Princeton to the University of Michigan (Michigan) and the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include Michigan as a party to that agreement. Also in connection with the transfer, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement with USC under which the Company continues to fund organic electronics research being conducted by Professors Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years . The Company makes payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of June 30, 2020, the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 9.0 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement of $ 304,000 and $ 260,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 581,000 and $ 503,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 10 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2020. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. 16 Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three or six months ended June 30, 2020 or 2019. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 836,000 and $ 288,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 1.3 million and $ 362,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 1 1 . SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had issued 48,992,532 shares of common stock, of which 47,626,884 were outstanding. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company repurchased no shares of common stock. During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company repurchased no shares of common stock and during the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company repurchased 4,011 shares of common stock, now held as treasury stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 649,000 . Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted a total of 1,926 and 1,960 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value of shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both six-month periods. Dividends During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.15 per common share, or $ 7.1 million, and during the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.30 per common share, or $ 14.2 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On August 4, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $ 0.15 per common share to be paid on September 30, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2020. All future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. 17 1 2 .

(2) Refer to Note 14: Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . 1 3 . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through June 30, 2020, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024. As of June 30, 2020, there were 2,018,657 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. 18 During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company granted 125,420 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 19.5 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 3.8 million and $ 2.5 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.1 million and $ 631,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 492,000 and $ 269,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 7.1 million and $ 4.9 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 2.0 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 892,000 and $ 496,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, 54,332 and 52,611 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 7.4 million and $ 8.7 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, 78,806 and 78,342 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 11.3 million and $ 12.5 million, respectively were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 156,000 and $ 131,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 112,000 and $ 413,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 299,000 and $ 237,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 596,000 and $ 471,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 3,228 and 5,180 shares, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Company granted 95,772 performance units, of which 47,885 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 47,887 units are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and which will vest over the terms described below. The weighted average grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 16.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.1 million and $ 11,000 , respectively, research and development expense of $ 301,000 and $ 3,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 183,000 and none , respectively, related to performance units. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.9 million and $ 277,000 , respectively, research and development expense of $ 503,000 and $ 68,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 296,000 and $ 30,000 , respectively, related to performance units. 19 In connection with the vesting of performance units during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, 12,877 and 16,668 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 1.9 million and $ 2.6 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company issued 5,467 and 4,360 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 590,000 and $ 445,000 , respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded charges of $ 37,000 and $ 25,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 44,000 and $ 33,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 37,000 and $ 18,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded charges of $ 59,000 and $ 47,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 72,000 and $ 64,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 56,000 and $ 38,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 1 4 . SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of June 30, 2020, there were seven participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Service cost $ 273 $ 227 $ 546 $ 515 Interest cost 321 403 642 806 Amortization of prior service cost 274 399 549 798 Amortization of loss 546 410 1,091 821 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,414 $ 1,439 $ 2,828 $ 2,940 20 1 5 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 9 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 9 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and two employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the officer and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 10) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 25.7 million and $ 22.0 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s materials sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division initially revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under 21 European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous and has appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The EPO Opposition Appeals Division indicated that certain subject matter may overcome some of the lower Opposition Division’s rejections as a matter of law. Applicants submitted revised claims consistent with the potentially-allowable subject matter identified by the Appeals Division. Applicants expect the case to be remanded to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration and withdrawal of at least some of the lower Opposition Division’s rejections. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 1 6 . CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended June 30, % of Total Revenue for the Six Months Ended June 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2020 2019 2020 2019 June 30, 2020 A 34 % 23 % 28 % 26 % $ 19,609 B 28 % 39 % 36 % 39 % $ 6,836 C 13 % 24 % 19 % 19 % $ 26,182 D 10 % 9 % 8 % 8 % $ 4,625 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 93 % and 97 % of consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and approximately 96 % and 97 % for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Country 2020 2019 2020 2019 South Korea $ 31,062 $ 58,762 $ 100,487 $ 120,261 China 20,508 54,972 58,342 75,750 Japan 2,197 818 3,984 2,665 Other non-U.S. locations 315 597 812 1,179 Total non-U.S. locations 54,082 115,149 163,625 199,855 United States 3,886 3,019 6,620 6,078 Total revenue $ 57,968 $ 118,168 $ 170,245 $ 205,933 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 United States $ 83,659 $ 80,027 Other 8,344 7,845 Total long-lived assets $ 92,003 $ 87,872 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 10. 1 7 . INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was a benefit of 222.1 % and an expense of 16.2 % for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and an expense of 17.3 % and 16.1 % for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of 22 $ 562,000 and an expense of $ 8.4 million for the three months ended June 30 , 20 20 and 201 9 , respectively , and an expense of $ 8.1 million and $ 14.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively . The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“wi ndfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09 of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.4 million for the three months ended June 30 , 20 20 and 201 9 , respectively , and $ 1.6 million and $ 2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively . In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded related to the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, the Company has decided to litigate the Korean withholding taxes paid or withheld on the 2018, 2019 and 2020 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 33.5 million and $ 26.9 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a long-term liability of $ 32.3 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. As a result, a petition has been filed with the Tax Tribunal. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2016 to 2019 are open and subject to examination. The State of New Jersey is currently auditing the 2014 and 2017 tax returns of UDC, Inc. The State and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and ultimately upon settlement of these uncertain tax positions. 1 8 . REVENUE RECOGNITION: Effective on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a transaction with one of its customers for emitters involving elements of variable consideration. Due to the escalation in trade policy tension between the governments of China and the United States, the customer required a larger than normal shipment of emitters having a right to return them through March 15, 2020 in order to accommodate their uncertain production needs. Per Topic 606, the Company was constrained to recognizing revenue on this unique shipment to the extent that it was probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur and deferred recognition of the remainder until after the inherent uncertainties of the transaction were resolved. These uncertainties included factors that were outside of the Company’s influence, including the customer’s production needs and complexities associated with the current international health and trade issues in China. On March 15, 2020, the inherent uncertainties of the transaction were resolved as the 23 customer did not exercise their right of return provision . This event resulted in the recognition of the previously constrained revenue during the six months ended June 30 , 2020. For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded 94 % and 98 % of its revenue from sales of materials, respectively, and 6 % and 2 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded 96 % and 97 % of its revenue from sales of materials and 4 % and 3 %, respectively, from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of June 30, 2020 Accounts receivable $ 68,498 Short-term unbilled receivables 6,566 Long-term unbilled receivables 4,362 Short-term deferred revenue 120,150 Long-term deferred revenue 51,317 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at June 30, 2020 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. The significant customer contracts (individually representing greater than 10% of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2020) expire in 2022 . As of June 30, 2020, the Company had $ 6.3 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, are as follows (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 48,249 Increases due to cash received — ( 75,683 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 829 Unbilled receivables recognized 9,566 — Net change 9,566 ( 26,605 ) Balance at June 30, 2020 $ 10,928 $ ( 171,467 ) Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ ( 122,567 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 63,337 Increases due to cash received — ( 68,213 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 320 Unbilled receivables recognized 1,064 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 779 ) — Net change 285 ( 4,556 ) Balance at June 30, 2019 $ 1,305 $ ( 127,123 ) 24 1 9 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 815 $ 43,440 $ 38,970 $ 74,914 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 6 ) ( 321 ) ( 318 ) ( 663 ) Adjusted net income $ 809 $ 43,119 $ 38,652 $ 74,251 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,227,294 46,967,005 47,160,163 46,930,165 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 483 495 924 994 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 16,214 29,202 29,418 35,013 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,243,991 46,996,702 47,190,505 46,966,172 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.02 $ 0.92 $ 0.82 $ 1.58 Diluted $ 0.02 $ 0.92 $ 0.82 $ 1.58 For the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 52,933 and none , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 30,785 and none , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 25 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above.

Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED), technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and • contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time control passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments 26 over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Visionox’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of June 30, 2020, Adesis employed a team of 98 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. 27 We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. Further, we continue to monitor the impact of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. We believe the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, and we expect the pandemic, as it evolves, to continue have an adverse impact on our results of operations in at least the near term, due in large part to the current disruption and uncertainties, potential continuing disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted for at least the balance of 2020, including as a result of: • temporary closure of electronics and other retail stores through which our customers sell the products for which they use our technology and materials; • consumer confidence and consumer spending habits, including spending for the products that our customers sell and negative trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels; • possible disruption to the supply chain caused by distribution and other logistical issues, which may impact suppliers of our raw materials as well as our ability to ship our materials to customers on a timely basis; • decreased productivity due to travel ban, work-from-home policies or shelter-in-place orders; • a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and uncertain global economic outlook or a credit crisis; and • uncertain trade restrictions amongst jurisdictions seeking to manage their respective exposure to risks, including the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the remainder of the 2020 fiscal year. 28 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 57,968 $ 118,168 $ (60,200 ) COST OF SALES 12,643 24,072 (11,429 ) Gross margin 45,325 94,096 (48,771 ) OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 21,397 18,833 2,564 Selling, general and administrative 16,147 15,939 208 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,490 5,490 — Patent costs 1,858 1,716 142 Royalty and license expense 1,618 3,454 (1,836 ) Total operating expenses 46,510 45,432 1,078 OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME (1,185 ) 48,664 (49,849 ) Interest income, net 1,268 2,757 (1,489 ) Other income, net 170 405 (235 ) Interest and other income, net 1,438 3,162 (1,724 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 253 51,826 (51,573 ) INCOME TAX BENEFIT (EXPENSE) 562 (8,386 ) 8,948 NET INCOME $ 815 $ 43,440 $ (42,625 ) Revenue During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recognized revenue of $58.0 million, a decrease of $60.2 million from $118.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2019. We believe the decrease in revenue was mainly due to the weakened demand for emitter product from our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the advanced purchases that were fulfilled in the prior quarter in anticipation of potential supply disruptions from the pandemic and inventory management efforts by our customers to minimize effects of potentially heightened trade tensions between the governments of China and the United States. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our operational performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors including the timing, extent and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, and the impact on the global economy and demand for OLED consumer products. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 94% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to 98% for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2020 decreased by $11.4 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, was an increase in inventory reserve of none and $3.9 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the decrease in material sales, gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2020 decreased by $48.8 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 78% from 80%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $21.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $18.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. 29 Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $16.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $15.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $1.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The results in the current year quarter reflected higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $3.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current quarter over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2019. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $170,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to $405,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2019. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was a benefit of 222.1% and an expense 16.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we recorded income tax benefit of $562,000 and $8.4 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09. For the three months ended June 30, 2020, without the $1.1 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 215.8% and $546,000, respectively, and for the three months ended June 30, 2019, without the $1.4 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 18.9% and $9.8 million, respectively. 30 Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 170,245 $ 205,933 $ (35,688 ) COST OF SALES 35,102 39,886 (4,784 ) Gross margin 135,143 166,047 (30,904 ) OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 40,894 34,662 6,232 Selling, general and administrative 31,550 27,908 3,642 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 10,980 10,976 4 Patent costs 3,496 3,486 10 Royalty and license expense 4,902 5,991 (1,089 ) Total operating expenses 91,822 83,023 8,799 OPERATING INCOME 43,321 83,024 (39,703 ) Interest income, net 3,415 5,588 (2,173 ) Other income, net 372 687 (315 ) Interest and other income, net 3,787 6,275 (2,488 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 47,108 89,299 (42,191 ) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (8,138 ) (14,385 ) 6,247 NET INCOME $ 38,970 $ 74,914 $ (35,944 ) Revenue During the six months ended June 30, 2020, we recognized revenue of $170.2 million, a decrease of $35.7 million from $205.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019. We believe the decrease in revenue was mainly due to the weakened demand for emitter product from our customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our operational performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors including the timing, extent and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, and the impact on the global economy and demand for OLED consumer products. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 96% of total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to 97% for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased by $4.8 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, was an increase in inventory reserve of $611,000 and $4.2 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the decrease in material sales, gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2020 decreased by $30.9 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 79% from 81%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $40.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $34.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $31.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $27.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. 31 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $11.0 million for both of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Patent costs Patent costs were $3.5 million for both of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $4.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $6.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current year over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2019. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $372,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to $687,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 17.3% and 16.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $8.1 million and $14.4 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, without the $1.6 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 20.6% and $9.7 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2019, without the $2.8 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 19.3% and $17.2 million, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of June 30, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $133.6 million and short-term investments of $510.4 million, for a total of $644.0 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $131.6 million and short-term investments of $514.5, for a total of $646.1 million, as of December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 was $32.0 million resulting from $39.0 million of net income and $20.0 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $27.0 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $75.7 million and a decrease in other liabilities of $5.8 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $21.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $20.4 million, an increase in other assets of $11.9 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $8.0 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $83.9 million resulting from $74.9 million of net income and $45.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $36.4 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $68.2 million, an increase in other liabilities of $6.1 million and a reduction of inventory of $5.7 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $23.8 million, an increase in other assets of $8.7 million, and a reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.1 million. 32 Cash used in investing activities was $ 3 . 3 million for the six months ended June 30 , 20 20 , as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $ 53.5 million for the six months ended June 30 , 2019 . The de crease was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales of $ 8. 5 million for the six months ended June 30 , 20 20 , as compared to $ 7 4. 2 million for the six months ended June 30 , 201 9 , partially offset by a de crease in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $ 8. 9 million for the six months ended June 30 , 20 20 compared to the six months ended June 30 , 201 9 . The de crease in property, plant and equipment purchases during 20 20 was primarily due to improvements to our Ewing facilities in New Jersey as part of our plan to expand operations during 2019 . Cash used in financing activities was $26.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to $24.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $4.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $1.3 million, a decrease in the repurchase of common stock of $649,000 and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $145,000. Working capital was $667.5 million as of June 30, 2020, as compared to $630.9 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in inventory, an increase in other current assets and a decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 30, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 33 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2020. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. 34 Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division initially revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous and have appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The EPO Opposition Appeals Division indicated that certain subject matter may overcome some of the lower Opposition Division’s rejections as a matter of law. Applicants submitted revised claims consistent with the potentially-allowable subject matter identified by the Appeals Division. Applicants expect the case to be remanded to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration and withdrawal of at least some of the lower Opposition Division’s rejections. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This section supplements and updates certain of the information found under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 based on information currently known to us and recent developments since the filing of such Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The matters discussed below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in such Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect it to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our operations and business. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, including any “second wave” of the pandemic that may commence later in 2020, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees and communities, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, including working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel . In the future, we may face closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. In addition, many of our customers may reduce their operations, as demand for their products becomes negatively affected, which would adversely impact our revenues from these customers. As a result, we would expect our financial results to be materially adversely impacted. In addition, consumer spending generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impact of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales for our customers and may also have an impact on their development of new products. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees. This policy may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business, and have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 35 The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its overall impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 2.

BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company's technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license the Company’s proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2020 and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) and UDC Ventures LLC. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 6 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. 7 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these 8 agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. 9 Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment , eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2017-04, beginning on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments: Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which requires measurement and recognition of expected losses for financial assets held. The new standard changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including debt investments and trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new-forward looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require organizations to incorporate considerations of historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-13, beginning on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 10 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit and U.S. Government bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value March 31, 2020 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 108,664 $ — $ — $ 108,664 Money market accounts 14,085 — — 14,085 U.S. Government bonds 99,989 7 ( 1 ) 99,995 $ 222,738 $ 7 $ ( 1 ) $ 222,744 December 31, 2019 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 119,272 $ — $ — $ 119,272 Money market accounts 12,355 — — 12,355 $ 131,627 $ — $ — $ 131,627 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value March 31, 2020 Certificates of deposit $ 750 $ 2 $ — $ 752 U.S. Government bonds 413,723 2,557 — 416,280 $ 414,473 $ 2,559 $ — $ 417,032 December 31, 2019 Certificates of deposit $ 700 $ — $ — $ 700 U.S. Government bonds 513,577 190 ( 6 ) 513,761 $ 514,277 $ 190 $ ( 6 ) $ 514,461 Minority Investments The Company’s portfolio of minority investments consists of investments in privately held early stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company does not obtain representation on the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had one minority investment with a carrying value of $ 5.0 million accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2020 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of March 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 114,080 $ 114,080 $ — $ — Short-term investments 417,032 417,032 — — 11 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 201 9 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 12,355 $ 12,355 $ — $ — Short-term investments 514,461 514,461 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of March 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. 5. INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Raw materials $ 31,802 $ 25,920 Work-in-process 5,234 7,987 Finished goods 37,032 30,046 Inventory $ 74,068 $ 63,953 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $ 611,000 and $ 224,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. 6.

LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of March 31, 2020, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 537 $ 430 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ — $ 8,273 As of March 31, 2020, current operating leases had remaining terms between one and nine years with options to extend the lease terms and the Company had operating lease right-of-use assets of $ 8.0 million, current operating lease liabilities of $ 1.4 million and long-term operating lease liabilities of $ 6.6 million. The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: March 31, 2020 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.3 Weighted average discount rate 5.5 % 14 Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of March 31, 2020, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2020 (1) $ 1,415 2021 1,252 2022 1,183 2023 1,044 2024 987 Thereafter 3,807 Total lease payments 9,688 Less: Imputed interest ( 1,737 ) Present value of lease payments $ 7,951 (1) Scheduled maturities of lease liabilities represent the time-period of April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. 9 . RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company funded OLED technology research at Princeton University and, on a subcontractor basis, at the University of Southern California for 10 years under a Research Agreement executed with Princeton University in August 1997 (the 1997 Research Agreement). The principal investigator conducting work under the 1997 Research Agreement transferred to the University of Michigan in January 2006. Following this transfer, the 1997 Research Agreement was allowed to expire on July 31, 2007. As a result of the transfer, the Company entered into a new Sponsored Research Agreement with the University of Southern California to sponsor OLED technology research and, on a subcontractor basis, with the University of Michigan. This new Sponsored Research Agreement (as amended, the 2006 Research Agreement) was effective as of May 1, 2006 and had an original term of three years . Since then, the 2006 Research Agreement was amended and extended several times with the most recent amendment having been completed on March 13, 2020 , extending the term through April 30, 2023 with an option to extend the term for an additional two years . The 2006 Research Agreement superseded the 1997 Research Agreement with respect to all work performed at the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan. Payments under the 2006 Research Agreement were made to the University of Southern California on a quarterly basis as actual expenses were incurred. As of March 31, 2020, the Company was obligated to pay the University of Southern California up to $ 9.1 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term, which expires April 30, 2023. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement of $ 272,000 and $ 243,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In connection with entering into the 2006 Research Agreement, the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include the University of Michigan as a party to that agreement effective as of January 1, 2006. Under this amendment, Princeton University, the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan have granted the Company a worldwide exclusive license, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. The financial terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement were not impacted by this amendment. On October 9, 1997, the Company, Princeton University and the University of Southern California entered into an Amended License Agreement (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement) under which Princeton University and the University of Southern California granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed by Princeton University and the University of Southern California under the 1997 Research Agreement. Under this 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to pay Princeton University royalties for licensed products sold by the Company or its sublicensees. For licensed products sold by the Company, the Company is required to pay Princeton University 3 % of the net sales price of these products. For licensed products sold by the Company’s sublicensees, the Company is required to pay Princeton 3 % of the revenues received by the Company from these sublicensees. These royalty rates are subject to renegotiation for products not reasonably conceivable as arising out of the 1997 Research Agreement if Princeton University reasonably determines that the royalty rates payable with respect to these products are not fair and competitive. The Company is obligated, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to pay to Princeton University minimum annual royalties. The minimum royalty payment is $ 100,000 per year. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 3.3 million and $ 2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 15 The Company also is required, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring the licensed OLED technology to market. However, this requirement is deemed satisfied if the Company invests a minimum of $ 800,000 per year in research, development, commercialization or patenting efforts respecting the patent rights licensed to the Company. 10 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2020. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three months ended March 31, 2020 or 2019. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 473,000 and $ 74,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 1 1 . SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had issued 48,910,232 shares of common stock, of which 47,544,584 were outstanding. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company repurchased no shares of common stock and during the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 4,011 shares of common stock, now held as treasury stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 649,000 . 16 Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted a total of 1,926 and 1,960 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value of shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both three-month periods. Dividends During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.15 per common share, or $ 7.1 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On May 5, 2020 , the Company’s Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $ 0.15 per common share to be paid on June 30, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2020 . All future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. 1 2 .

(2) Refer to Note 14: Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . 1 3 . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through March 31, 2020, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity 17 Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024 . As of March 31 , 20 20 , there were 2,018,037 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company granted 125,040 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 19.5 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 3.3 million and $ 2.4 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 877,000 and $ 546,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 400,000 and $ 227,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, 24,474 and 25,731 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 3.9 million and $ 3.8 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development credit of $ 43,000 and expense of $ 282,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 297,000 and $ 234,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 1,614 and 2,590 shares, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company granted 95,772 performance units, of which 47,885 units are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 47,887 units are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and will vest over the terms described below. The weighted average grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 16.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 811,000 and $ 266,000 , respectively, research and development expense of $ 202,000 and $ 65,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 113,000 and $ 29,000 , respectively, related to performance units. 18 In connection with the vesting of performance units during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, 5,963 and 16,668 shares, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $ 930,000 and $ 2.6 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company issued 2,315 and 2,571 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 259,000 and $ 204,000 , respectively. For both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded charges of $ 22,000 to selling, general and administrative expense and $ 19,000 to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded charges of $ 28,000 and $ 32,000 , respectively, to research and development expense related to the ESPP. 1 4 . SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is currently unfunded and includes salary and bonus as part of the plan. The purpose of the SERP is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of March 31, 2020, there were seven participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Service cost $ 273 $ 288 Interest cost 321 403 Amortization of prior service cost 275 399 Amortization of loss 545 411 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,414 $ 1,501 19 1 5 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 9 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 9 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and two employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the officer and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 10) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 24.9 million and $ 22.0 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s materials sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under 20 European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and has appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The EPO Opposition Division has scheduled an appeal hearing for the third quarter of 2020. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that all or a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 1 6 . CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Total Revenue for the Three Months Ended March 31, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2020 2019 March 31, 2020 A 41 % 40 % $ 20,663 B 25 % 30 % $ 10,870 C 23 % 13 % $ 33,421 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 98 % and 97 % of consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, Country 2020 2019 South Korea $ 69,425 $ 61,499 China 37,834 20,778 Japan 1,787 1,846 Other non-U.S. locations 497 583 Total non-U.S. locations 109,543 84,706 United States 2,734 3,059 Total revenue $ 112,277 $ 87,765 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 United States $ 79,969 $ 80,027 Other 8,381 7,845 Total long-lived assets $ 88,350 $ 87,872 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 10. 1 7 . INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 18.6 % and 16.0 % for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 8.7 million and $ 6.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09 of $ 450,000 and $ 1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability 21 to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded relate d to the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, the Company has decided to litigate the Korean withholding taxes paid or withheld on the 2018, 2019 and 2020 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 30.2 million and $ 26.9 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a long-term liability of $ 29.0 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. As a result, a petition has been filed with the Tax Tribunal. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2016 to 2019 are open and subject to examination. The State of New Jersey is currently auditing the 2014 and 2017 tax returns of UDC, Inc. The State and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and ultimately upon settlement of these uncertain tax positions. 1 8 . REVENUE RECOGNITION: Effective on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a transaction with one of its customers for emitters involving elements of variable consideration. Due to the escalation in trade policy tension between the governments of China and the United States, the customer required a larger than normal shipment of emitters having a right to return them through March 15, 2020 in order to accommodate their uncertain production needs. Per Topic 606, the Company was constrained to recognizing revenue on this unique shipment to the extent that it was probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur and deferred recognition of the remainder until after the inherent uncertainties of the transaction were resolved. These uncertainties included factors that were outside of the Company’s influence, including the customer’s production needs and complexities associated with the current international health and trade issues in China. On March 15, 2020, the inherent uncertainties of the transaction were resolved as the customer did not exercise their right of return provision. This event resulted in the recognition of the previously constrained revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2020. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded 98 % and 97 % of its revenue from sales of materials, respectively, and 2 % and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. 22 Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of March 31, 2020 Accounts receivable $ 82,592 Short-term unbilled receivables 2,757 Short-term deferred revenue 99,565 Long-term deferred revenue 49,866 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at March 31, 2020 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. The significant customer contracts (individually representing greater than 10% of revenue) expire in 2022 . As of March 31, 2020, the Company had $ 5.2 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 Unbilled Receivables Increase (Decrease) Deferred Revenue (Increase) Decrease Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 38,749 Increases due to cash received — ( 43,685 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 367 Unbilled receivables recognized 1,395 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables — — Net change 1,395 ( 4,569 ) Balance at March 31, 2020 $ 2,757 $ ( 149,431 ) Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Unbilled Receivables Increase (Decrease) Deferred Revenue (Increase) Decrease Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ ( 122,567 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 27,596 Increases due to cash received — ( 33,080 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 159 Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 779 ) — Net change ( 779 ) ( 5,325 ) Balance at March 31, 2019 $ 241 $ ( 127,892 ) 1 9 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. 23 For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the E mployee Stock Purchase Plan . The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 38,155 $ 31,474 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 339 ) ( 325 ) Adjusted net income $ 37,816 $ 31,149 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,093,033 46,892,914 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 441 800 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 29,355 38,285 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,122,829 46,931,999 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.80 $ 0.66 Diluted $ 0.80 $ 0.66 For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 14,112 and 1,157 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 24 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the section entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as supplemented by disclosures in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED), technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and • contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time control passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments 25 over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Visionox’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of March 31, 2020, Adesis employed a team of 97 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. 26 We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. Further, we are monitoring the impact of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. While we believe the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a limited impact on our operations and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2020, we expect the pandemic, as it evolves, to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, due in large part to the potential disruption of the global economy and its impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments as required by our customers. However, this sustainability is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, including working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will be adversely impacted for at least the balance of 2020, including as a result of: • temporary closure of electronics and other retail stores through which our customers sell the products for which they use our technology and materials; • consumer confidence and consumer spending habits, including spending for the products that our customers sell and negative trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels; • possible disruption to the supply chain caused by distribution and other logistical issues, which may impact suppliers of our raw materials; • decreased productivity due to travel ban, work-from-home policies or shelter-in-place orders; • a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and uncertain global economic outlook or a credit crisis. We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the remainder of the 2020 fiscal year. 27 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 112,277 $ 87,765 $ 24,512 COST OF SALES 22,459 15,814 6,645 Gross margin 89,818 71,951 17,867 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 19,497 15,829 3,668 Selling, general and administrative 15,403 11,969 3,434 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,490 5,486 4 Patent costs 1,638 1,770 (132 ) Royalty and license expense 3,284 2,537 747 Total operating expenses 45,312 37,591 7,721 OPERATING INCOME 44,506 34,360 10,146 Interest income, net 2,147 2,831 (684 ) Other income, net 202 282 (80 ) Interest and other income, net 2,349 3,113 (764 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 46,855 37,473 9,382 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (8,700 ) (5,999 ) (2,701 ) NET INCOME $ 38,155 $ 31,474 $ 6,681 Revenue During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recognized revenue of $112.3 million, an increase of $24.5 million from $87.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019. We believe the increase in revenue was mainly due to the impact from customer inventory management efforts to minimize the effects of potentially heightened trade tensions between the governments of China and the United States and estimated advanced material purchases due to the potential for future supply disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 98% of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to 97% for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased by $6.6 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, was an increase in inventory reserve of $611,000 and $224,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in material sales, gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2020, increased by $17.9 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2019, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 80% from 82%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $19.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to $15.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $15.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to $12.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. 28 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. Patent costs Patent costs decreased to $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The results in the current year quarter reflected lower outside counsel fees offset by higher talent related maintenance costs and higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the current quarter over bond yields on available-for-sale investments held in the comparable period in 2019. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $202,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 as compared to $282,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 18.6% and 16.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $8.7 million and $6.0 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, without the $450,000 benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 19.5% and $9.2 million, respectively, and for the three months ended March 31, 2019, without the $1.5 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 20.0% and $7.5 million, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $222.7 million and short-term investments of $417.1 million, for a total of $639.8 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $131.6 million and short-term investments of $514.5, for a total of $646.1 million, as of December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $5.7 million resulting from $38.2 million of net income, partially offset by a $24.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation, and a $8.0 million reduction due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $29.3 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $22.2 million and an increase in inventory of $10.7 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $43.7 million, an increase in other liabilities of $6.1 million and a decrease in other assets of $4.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $34.1 million resulting from $31.5 million of net income and $17.8 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $15.2 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $33.1 million and a reduction of inventory of $1.7 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $9.0 million, a reduction of accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $5.2 million and an increase in other assets of $2.8 million. 29 Cash provided by investing activities was $ 97.0 million the three months ended March 31, 20 20 , as compared to cash used in investing activities of $ 9 . 1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The in crease was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales of $ 101.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 20 20 , as compared to $ 4. 6 million for the three months ended March 31, 201 9 , partially offset by a de crease in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $ 8.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 20 20 compared to the three months ended March 31, 201 9 . The de crease in property, plant and equipment purchases during 20 20 was primarily due to improvements to our Ewing facilities in New Jersey as part of our plan to expand operations during 2019 . Cash used in financing activities was $11.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to $10.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $2.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $941,000, a decrease in the repurchase of common stock of $649,000 and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $55,000. Working capital was $675.5 million as of March 31, 2020, compared to $630.9 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease in accrued expenses, an increase in accounts receivable, and an increase in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of March 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 30 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. 31 Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and has appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The EPO Opposition Division has scheduled an appeal hearing for the third quarter of 2020. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that all or a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS This section supplements and updates certain of the information found under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 based on information currently known to us and recent developments since the filing of such Annual Report on Form 10-K. The matters discussed below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in such Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material adverse effect on our operations and business. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees and communities, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, including working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel . In the future, we may face closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. In addition, many of our customers may reduce their operations, as demand for their products becomes negatively affected, which would adversely impact our revenues from these customers. As a result, we would expect our financial results to be materially adversely impacted. In addition, consumer spending generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impact of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales for our customers and may also have an impact on their development of new products. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees. This policy may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business, and have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its overall impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 32 ITEM 2.

SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company's technology leadership and intellectual property position should enable it to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they enter mainstream consumer and other markets. The Company's primary business strategy is to (1) further develop and license its proprietary OLED technologies to manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, tablets, wearables, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to those product manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining its relationships with world-class partners such as Princeton University (Princeton), the University of Southern California (USC), the University of Michigan (Michigan) and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG Industries). The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under its patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies who are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2019 and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited, Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) and UDC Ventures LLC. UDC Ventures LLC was formed on March 1, 2019 as a corporate venture capital entity that will assist in funding companies that are developing innovative products and technologies that may be synergistic to those of the Company. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 7 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities. As discussed in Note 8, effective January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases . At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities and the long-term portion is included in non-current other liabilities. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in Investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in this assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. 8 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. These agreements are combined and the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. Total contract consideration includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees as well as estimates of material fees and royalties to be earned. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process and related amounts to be charged. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis through performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which includes reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs in relation to its government contracts. Revenues are recognized proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved, and are included in contract research services in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights 9 under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company suppl ies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. The Company records taxes billed to customers and remitted to various governmental entities on a gross basis in both revenues and cost of material sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The amounts of these pass through taxes reflected in revenues and cost of material sales were $ 65,000 and $ 120,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively, and $ 35,000 and $ 64,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. All sales transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation 10 adjustments in the C onsolidated B alance S heets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which addresses the classification and recognition of lease assets and liabilities formerly classified as operating leases under generally accepted accounting principles. The guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition and measurement, and quantitative and qualitative aspects of presentation and disclosure. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the standard beginning January 1, 2019 using the “modified retrospective” approach, meaning the standard was applied only to the most current period presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and have applied all practical expedients related to leases existing at the date of initial application including the exception for short-term leases. Adoption of the new standard resulted in an increase in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of $ 8.3 million based on the present value of the future minimum rental payments for existing operating leases. The Company has no leases that qualify as financing arrangements. See Note 8 for additional information. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2017-04 may have on its Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments: Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which requires measurement and recognition of expected losses for financial assets held. Topic 326 changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require organizations to incorporate considerations of historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in 11 fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2016-13 may have on its C onsolidated F inancial S tatements and related disclosures. 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government and corporate bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2019 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total carrying value as of September 30, 2019 Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 163,005 $ 163,005 $ — $ — Short-term investments 361,515 361,515 — — The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total carrying value as of December 31, 2018 Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 139,805 $ 139,805 $ — $ — Short-term investments 304,323 304,323 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income. If a decline in fair value of an investment is deemed to be other than temporary, the cost of the Company’s investment will be written down by the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment with a resulting charge to net income. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments as of September 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018. 5.

LEASES: The Company has entered operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of September 30, 2019, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. As stated in Note 2, effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842 using the modified retrospective transition method. As such, the Company did not restate financial statement or lease disclosure data for periods prior to January 1, 2019, which was prepared in accordance with ASC Topic 840 – Leases . The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 September 30, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 456 $ 1,316 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 1,503 $ 9,776 As of September 30, 2019, current operating leases had remaining terms between 1 and 9 years with options to extend the lease terms and the Company had operating lease right-of-use assets of $ 8.8 million, current operating lease liabilities of $ 1.7 million and long-term operating lease liabilities of $ 7.1 million. Operating lease cost was $ 1.7 million for the full year 2018. The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: September 30, 2019 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.5 Weighted average discount rate 5.5 % 15 Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2019, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2019 (1) $ 517 2020 1,932 2021 1,252 2022 1,183 2023 1,044 Thereafter 4,829 Total lease payments 10,757 Less imputed interest ( 1,969 ) Present value of lease payments $ 8,788 (1) Scheduled maturities of lease liabilities represent the time-period of October 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.

RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company funded OLED technology research at Princeton University and, on a subcontractor basis, at the University of Southern California for 10 years under a Research Agreement executed with Princeton University in August 1997 (the 1997 Research Agreement). The principal investigator conducting work under the 1997 Research Agreement transferred to the University of Michigan in January 2006. Following this transfer, the 1997 Research Agreement was allowed to expire on July 31, 2007. As a result of the transfer, the Company entered into a new Sponsored Research Agreement with the University of Southern California to sponsor OLED technology research and, on a subcontractor basis, with the University of Michigan. This new Sponsored Research Agreement (as amended, the 2006 Research Agreement) was effective as of May 1, 2006 and had an original term of three years . On May 1, 2009, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years . The 2006 Research Agreement superseded the 1997 Research Agreement with respect to all work being performed at the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan. Payments under the 2006 Research Agreement were made to the University of Southern California on a quarterly basis as actual expenses were incurred. The Company incurred a total of $ 5.0 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement during the extended term, which ended on April 30, 2013. Effective June 1, 2013, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years . The Company incurred a total of $ 4.6 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement during the extended term. Effective May 1, 2017, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement once again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional three years . As of September 30, 2019, in connection with this amendment, the Company was obligated to pay the University of Southern California up to $ 2.1 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term, which expires April 30, 2020. From May 1, 2017 through September 30, 2019, the Company incurred $ 2.3 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. 16 On October 9, 1997, the Company, Princeton University and the University of Southern California entered into an Amended License Agreement (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement) under which Princeton University and the University of Southern California granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed by Princeton University and the University of Southern California under the 1997 Research Agreement. Under this 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to pay Princeton University royalties for licensed products sold by the Company or its sublicensees. For licensed products sold by the Company, the Company is required to pay Princeton University 3 % of the net sales price of these products. For licensed products sold by the Company’s sublicensees, the Company is required to pay Princeton 3 % of the revenues received by the Company from these sublicensees. These royalty rates are subject to renegotiation for products not reasonably conceivable as arising out of the 1997 Research Agreement if Princeton University reasonably determines that the royalty rates payable with respect to these products are not fair and competitive. The Company is obligated, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to pay to Princeton University minimum annual royalties. The minimum royalty payment is $ 100,000 per year. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 2.8 million and $ 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 8.8 million and $ 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company also is required, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring the licensed OLED technology to market. However, this requirement is deemed satisfied if the Company invests a minimum of $ 800,000 per year in research, development, commercialization or patenting efforts respecting the patent rights licensed to the Company. In connection with entering into the 2006 Research Agreement, the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include the University of Michigan as a party to that agreement effective as of January 1, 2006. Under this amendment, Princeton University, the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan have granted the Company a worldwide exclusive license, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. The financial terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement were not impacted by this amendment. 10 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG Industries effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2019. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG Industries continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG Industries on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG Industries is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG Industries in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2019 or 2018. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG Industries for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 580,000 and $ 203,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 941,000 and $ 403,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG Industries, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 17 1 1 .

(2) Refer to Note 14: Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . 1 3 . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity based awards, such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved, and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through September 30, 2019, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024. As of September 30, 2019, there were 2,328,225 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Stock Awards Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. 19 During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company granted 51,579 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 8.5 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units granted to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 2.2 million for both three month periods, research and development expense of $ 641,000 and $ 517,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 273,000 and $ 201,000 , respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, 85,758 and 86,486 shares, with aggregate fair values of $ 14.0 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations. For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, research and development expense of $ 54,000 and $ 165,000 , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, research and development expense of $ 467,000 and $ 49,000 , respectively. Board of Directors Compensation The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 187,000 and $ 1.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 659,000 and $ 3.2 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 7,256 and 18,750 shares, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Performance Unit Awards During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company granted 10,096 performance units, of which 5,050 are subject to a performance-based vesting and 5,046 are subject to a market-based vesting requirement and will vest over the terms described below. Total fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 2.0 million on the date of grant. Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's cumulative revenue growth or total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 289,000 and $ 352,000 , respectively, research and development expense of $ 70,000 and $ 86,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 34,000 and $ 38,000 , respectively, related to performance units. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 566,000 and $ 1.3 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 138,000 and $ 319,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 64,000 and $ 138,000 , respectively, related to performance units. 20 In connection with the vesting of performance units during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, 16,668 and 25,208 shares with an aggregate fair value of $ 2.6 million and $ 2.9 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued 5,852 and 7,991 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 658,000 and $ 616,000 , respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded charges of $ 19,000 and $ 31,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 24,000 and $ 50,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 16,000 and $ 31,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded charges of $ 66,000 and $ 71,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 88,000 and $ 105,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 53,000 and $ 64,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 1 4 . SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), effective as of April 1, 2010. On March 3, 2015, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors amended the SERP to include salary and bonus as part of the plan. Prior to this amendment, the SERP benefit did not take into account any bonuses. This change increased the liability for certain participants in the SERP. The purpose of the SERP, which is unfunded, is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental retirement benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of September 30, 2019, there were seven participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Service cost $ 227 $ 326 $ 742 $ 976 Interest cost 403 261 1,209 785 Amortization of prior service cost 399 420 1,197 1,262 Amortization of loss 410 119 1,231 355 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,439 $ 1,126 $ 4,379 $ 3,378 21 1 5 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 9 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 9 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and one employee which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment in connection with a change in control of the Company. If the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the officer and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 10) that allows PPG Industries to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 23.6 million and $ 15.9 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s materials sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. 22 The EPO combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under EPC Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and has appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid, and that all or a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely utilized in the marketplace. 1 6 . CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Revenues for the Three Months Ended September 30, % of Revenues for the Nine Months Ended September 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2019 2018 2019 2018 September 30, 2019 A 56 % 50 % 45 % 36 % $ 21,615 B 21 % 19 % 24 % 35 % $ 9,820 C 12 % 9 % 17 % 8 % $ 19,609 D 1 % 10 % 5 % 9 % $ 444 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % and 96 % of consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 97 % and 95 % of consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Country 2019 2018 2019 2018 South Korea $ 70,042 $ 53,883 $ 190,303 $ 126,789 China 23,205 17,037 98,955 34,368 Japan 1,137 3,076 3,802 4,637 Other non-U.S. locations 539 457 1,718 2,078 Total non-U.S. locations 94,923 74,453 294,778 167,872 United States 2,592 3,097 8,670 9,399 Total revenue $ 97,515 $ 77,550 $ 303,448 $ 177,271 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 United States $ 79,437 $ 64,560 Other 6,829 5,179 Total long-lived assets $ 86,266 $ 69,739 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 10. 1 7 . INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 15.3 % and 18.9 % for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 15.8 % and 15.0 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 6.7 million and $ 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 21.1 million and $ 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09 of $ 693,000 and $ 29,000 for the three months ended September 23 30 , 2019 and 2018 , respectively , and $ 3.5 million and $ 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively . For the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company released a deferred tax liability of $ 1.9 million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the 2015 Federal tax return. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that relates to the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-US Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, the Company has decided to immediately litigate the Korean withholding taxes paid or withheld on the 2018 and 2019 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 23.5 million and $ 13.6 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and R&D credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) concluded a tax audit with LG Display (LGD) that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. As a result, a petition has been filed with the Tax Tribunal. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The above estimates may change in the future and ultimately upon settlement of these uncertain tax positions. 1 8 . REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Management is using the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded 97 % and 96 % of its revenue from sales of materials and 3 % and 4 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded 97 % and 95 % of its revenue from sales of materials and 3 % and 5 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. 24 Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of September 30, 2019 Accounts receivable $ 65,774 Short-term unbilled receivables 467 Long-term unbilled receivables 6,899 Short-term deferred revenue 91,188 Long-term deferred revenue 50,495 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred revenue balance at September 30, 2019 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. The significant customer contracts (individually representing greater than 10% of revenue) expire in 2022 . As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $ 11.3 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances during the period are as follows (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 Unbilled Receivables Increase (Decrease) Deferred Revenue (Increase) Decrease Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ ( 122,567 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 94,044 Increases due to cash received — ( 113,849 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 689 Unbilled receivables recognized 7,571 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 1,225 ) — Net change 6,346 ( 19,116 ) Balance at September 30, 2019 $ 7,366 $ ( 141,683 ) 1 9 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share (""ASC 260""), which requires earnings per share for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholder’s proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP. 25 The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 36,962 $ 22,818 $ 111,876 $ 39,591 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 260 ) ( 242 ) ( 922 ) ( 481 ) Adjusted net income $ 36,702 $ 22,576 $ 110,954 $ 39,110 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 46,980,439 46,869,998 46,947,109 46,841,036 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 249 754 1,142 1,682 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 33,231 43,801 35,650 51,050 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,013,919 46,914,553 46,983,901 46,893,768 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.78 $ 0.48 $ 2.36 $ 0.83 Diluted $ 0.78 $ 0.48 $ 2.36 $ 0.83 For the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of none and 5,464 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of none and 4,143 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. The impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP, which was not significant, was excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 26 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the section entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as supplemented by disclosures, if any, in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode, or OLED, technologies and materials for use in displays for mobile phones, televisions, tablets, wearables, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been exclusively engaged, and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • contract research services in the areas of organic and organometallic materials synthesis research, development and commercialization; and • technology development and support, including government contract work and support provided to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in 27 quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the term of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display's sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co. Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of September 30, 2019, Adesis employed a team of 91 research scientists, chemists, engineers, and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries providing contract research services to those third party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customer s. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which include reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur in relation to our government contracts. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. 28 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 97,515 $ 77,550 $ 19,965 COST OF SALES 17,286 16,123 1,163 Gross margin 80,229 61,427 18,802 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 16,787 13,616 3,171 Selling, general and administrative 12,623 12,120 503 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,493 5,493 — Patent costs 1,659 1,937 (278 ) Royalty and license expense 2,837 2,229 608 Total operating expenses 39,399 35,395 4,004 OPERATING INCOME 40,830 26,032 14,798 Interest income, net 2,748 2,118 630 Other income (expense), net 53 (7 ) 60 Interest and other income, net 2,801 2,111 690 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 43,631 28,143 15,488 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (6,669 ) (5,325 ) (1,344 ) NET INCOME $ 36,962 $ 22,818 $ 14,144 Revenue During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized revenue of $97.5 million, an increase of $19.9 million from $77.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in revenue was due to higher material sales as a result of stronger demand in the OLED display market. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 97% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to 96% for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Contract research services include revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which performs organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased by $1.2 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018, was an increase in inventory reserve of $1.0 million due to excess inventory levels in certain products. There was no increase in inventory reserve for the three months ended September 30, 2019. As a result of the increase in material sales, gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2019 increased by $18.8 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue increasing to 82% from 79%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $16.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $12.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. 29 Patent costs Patent costs decreased to $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to the increase in available-for-sale investments held in the current quarter over amounts held in the comparable period in 2018. Other income (expense), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $53,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to other expense, net of $7,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 15.3% and 18.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $6.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09. For the three months ended September 30, 2019, without the $693,000 benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 16.9% and $7.4 million, respectively, and for the three months ended September 30, 2018, without the $29,000 benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 19.0% and $5.4 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2019, the Company released a deferred tax liability of $1.9 million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the 2015 Federal tax return. Without the release of the deferred tax liability, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 19.6% and $8.6 million, respectively for the three months ended September 30, 2019. Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 303,448 $ 177,271 $ 126,177 COST OF SALES 57,172 35,216 21,956 Gross margin 246,276 142,055 104,221 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 51,449 38,922 12,527 Selling, general and administrative 40,531 34,473 6,058 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 16,469 16,479 (10 ) Patent costs 5,145 5,691 (546 ) Royalty and license expense 8,828 5,028 3,800 Total operating expenses 122,422 100,593 21,829 OPERATING INCOME 123,854 41,462 82,392 Interest income, net 8,336 5,155 3,181 Other income (expense), net 740 (66 ) 806 Interest and other income, net 9,076 5,089 3,987 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 132,930 46,551 86,379 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (21,054 ) (6,960 ) (14,094 ) NET INCOME $ 111,876 $ 39,591 $ 72,285 30 Revenue During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized revenue of $303.4 million, an increase of $126.1 million from $177.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in revenue was due to higher material sales as a result of stronger demand in the OLED display market. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 97% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to 95% for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Contract research services include revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which performs organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased by $22.0 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, was an increase in inventory reserve of $4.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in material sales, gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 increased by $104.2 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue increasing to 81% from 80%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $51.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $38.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $34.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $16.5 million for both of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. Patent costs Patent costs decreased to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to the increase in available-for-sale investments held in the current year over amounts held in the comparable period in 2018. Other income (expense), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $740,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 as compared to other expense, net of $66,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. 31 Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 15.8% and 15.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $21.1 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, without the $3.5 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 18.5% and $24.6 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, without the $1.8 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 18.8% and $8.8 million, respectively During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Company released a deferred tax liability of $1.9 million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the 2015 Federal tax return. Without the release of the deferred tax liability, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 17.2% and $23.0 million, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of September 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $235.5 million and short-term investments of $361.5 million, for a total of $597.0 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $211.0 million and short-term investments of $304.3, for a total of $515.3 million, as of December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $137.7 million resulting from $111.9 million of net income and $88.3 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $62.5 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $113.8 million, a reduction of inventory of $8.1 million and an increase in other liabilities of $5.7 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $22.6 million, an increase in other assets of $14.9 million, and a reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.8 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $95.0 million resulting from $39.6 million of net income and $56.1 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. This increase was partially offset by a $769,000 decrease due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and deferred income taxes. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $99.9 million, an increase in other liabilities of $18.3 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $9.2 million, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $439,000, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $37.9 million and an increase in inventory of $33.8 million. Cash used in investing activities was $83.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $106.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in cash used in investing activities of $23.0 million was primarily due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $57.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $85.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, partially offset by an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2019 was primarily due to the purchase of additional property in Ewing, New Jersey as part of our plan to expand operations. Cash used in financing activities was $30.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $19.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $10.2 million was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $5.7 million, an increase in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $4.3 million and an increase in the repurchase of common stock of $172,000, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $42,000. Working capital was $582.6 million as of September 30, 2019, compared to $501.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in inventory and an increase in deferred revenue. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. 32 We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2019. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 33 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of our goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and as our patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of a certain active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (EP '962 patent), which relates to our white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The EPO combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under EPC Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and we have appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. This patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid, and that all or a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely utilized in the marketplace.

BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company's technology leadership and intellectual property position should enable it to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they enter mainstream consumer and other markets. The Company's primary business strategy is to (1) further develop and license its proprietary OLED technologies to manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, tablets, wearables, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to those product manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining its relationships with world-class partners such as Princeton University (Princeton), the University of Southern California (USC), the University of Michigan (Michigan) and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG Industries). The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under its patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies who are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of June 30, 2019 and results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end financial statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited, Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd. Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) and UDC Ventures LLC. UDC Ventures LLC was formed on March 1, 2019 as a corporate venture capital entity that will assist in funding companies that are developing innovative products and technologies that may be synergistic to those of the Company. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 7 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments, lease liabilities, right-of use assets and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying financial statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities. As discussed in Note 8, effective January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases . At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities and the long-term portion is included in non-current other liabilities. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in this assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. 8 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. These agreements are combined and the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. Total contract consideration includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees as well as estimates of material fees and royalties to be earned. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process and related amounts to be charged. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis through performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which includes reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs in relation to its government contracts. Revenues are recognized proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved, and are included in contract research services in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights 9 under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company suppl ies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. The Company records taxes billed to customers and remitted to various governmental entities on a gross basis in both revenues and cost of material sales in the consolidated statements of income. The amounts of these pass through taxes reflected in revenues and cost of material sales were $ 17,000 and $ 55,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, respectively, and $ 23,000 and $ 29,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. All sales transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years. See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the consolidated statements of income from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation 10 adjustments in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the consolidated statements of income the grant-date fair value of equity based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which addresses the classification and recognition of lease assets and liabilities formerly classified as operating leases under generally accepted accounting principles. The guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition and measurement, and quantitative and qualitative aspects of presentation and disclosure. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the standard beginning January 1, 2019 using the “modified retrospective” approach, meaning the standard was applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements and have applied all practical expedients related to leases existing at the date of initial application including the exception for short-term leases. Adoption of the new standard resulted in an increase in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of $ 8.3 million based on the present value of the future minimum rental payments for existing operating leases. The Company has no leases that qualify as financing arrangements. See Note 8 for additional information. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2017-04 may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government and corporate bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the 11 purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value June 30, 2019 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 85,749 $ — $ — $ 85,749 Money market accounts 8,917 — — 8,917 U.S. Government bonds 229,576 35 — 229,611 $ 324,242 $ 35 $ — $ 324,277 December 31, 2018 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 71,217 $ — $ — $ 71,217 Money market accounts 11,014 — — 11,014 U.S. Government bonds 128,782 9 — 128,791 $ 211,013 $ 9 $ — $ 211,022 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value June 30, 2019 Certificates of deposit $ 950 $ — $ — $ 950 U.S. Government bonds 227,376 108 — 227,484 $ 228,326 $ 108 $ — $ 228,434 December 31, 2018 Certificates of deposit $ 500 $ — $ ( 1 ) $ 499 Corporate bonds 114,678 1 ( 19 ) 114,660 U.S. Government bonds 189,202 5 ( 43 ) 189,164 $ 304,380 $ 6 $ ( 63 ) $ 304,323 Minority Investments The Company’s portfolio of minority investments consists of investments in privately held early stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company does not obtain representation on the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had one minority investment with a carrying value of $ 5.0 million accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2019 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total carrying value as of June 30, 2019 Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 238,528 $ 238,528 $ — $ — Short-term investments 228,434 228,434 — — 12 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 201 8 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total carrying value as of December 31, 2018 Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 139,805 $ 139,805 $ — $ — Short-term investments 304,323 304,323 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income. If a decline in fair value of an investment is deemed to be other than temporary, the cost of the Company’s investment will be written down by the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment with a resulting charge to net income. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments as of June 30, 2019 or December 31, 2018. 5. INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Raw materials $ 31,700 $ 31,203 Work-in-process 5,709 781 Finished goods 22,729 38,016 Inventory $ 60,138 $ 70,000 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $ 3.9 million and $ 183,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 4.2 million and $ 183,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. 6. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment, net consist of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Land $ 2,642 $ 1,006 Building and improvements 46,623 39,285 Office and lab equipment 62,388 55,333 Furniture, fixtures and computer related assets 7,331 6,941 Construction-in-progress 15,353 12,117 134,337 114,682 Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 50,742 ) ( 44,943 ) Property and equipment, net $ 83,595 $ 69,739 Depreciation expense was $ 3.0 million and $ 2.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 5.8 million and $ 4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company purchased property in Ewing, New Jersey, adjacent to its headquarters, as part of its plan to expand operations. The new facilities added approximately 88,000 square feet at a cost of $ 8.2 million and will allow for the expansion of research and development activities, manufacturing logistics and other corporate functions. 13 7 . GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of acquired technology and other intangible assets that include trade names, customer relationships and developed IP processes. Acquired Technology Acquired technology consists of acquired license rights for patents and know-how obtained from PD-LD, Inc., Motorola, BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm. These intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): June 30, 2019 PD-LD, Inc. $ 1,481 Motorola 15,909 BASF 95,989 Fujifilm 109,462 Other 401 223,242 Less: Accumulated amortization ( 122,179 ) Acquired technology, net $ 101,063 Amortization expense related to acquired technology was $ 5.1 million for both three month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and $ 10.3 million for both six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the consolidated statements of income and is expected to be $ 20.6 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2019 through 2021, $ 15.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2022, $ 9.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2023 and $ 24.1 million thereafter. Fujifilm Patent Acquisition On July 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Patent Sale Agreement with Fujifilm. Under the agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $ 105.0 million, plus costs incurred in connection with the purchase. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The agreement permitted the Company to assign all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to its affiliates, and the Company assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement, its rights and obligations to UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. The Company recorded the $ 105.0 million plus $ 4.5 million of purchase costs as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition of, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of € 86.8 million ($ 95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of € 86.8 million ($ 95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $ 217,000 as acquired technology which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. 14 Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $ 16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $ 10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $ 4.8 million of internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $ 1.5 million assigned to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years. At June 30, 2019, these other intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Customer relationships $ 10,520 $ ( 2,682 ) $ 7,838 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 ( 947 ) 3,873 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 ( 442 ) 1,058 Total identifiable intangible assets $ 16,840 $ ( 4,071 ) $ 12,769 Amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $ 345,000 for both three month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and $ 687,000 for both six month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in the amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 1.4 million for each of the next five fiscal years (2019-2023) and $ 6.5 million thereafter. 8. LEASES: The Company has entered operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of June 30, 2019, the Company did not have any finance leases and had one operating lease that had not yet commenced, related to the expansion of office space in New York City for UDC Ventures LLC. As stated in Note 2, effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842 using the modified retrospective transition method. As such, the Company did not restate financial statement or lease disclosure data for periods prior to January 1, 2019, which was prepared in accordance with ASC Topic 840 – Leases . The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 430 $ 860 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ — $ 8,273 As of June 30, 2019, current operating leases had remaining terms between 1 and 9 years with options to extend the lease terms and the Company had operating lease right-of-use assets of $ 7.6 million, current operating lease liabilities of $ 1.3 million and long-term operating lease liabilities of $ 6.3 million. Operating lease cost was $ 1.7 million in 2018. The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: June 30, 2019 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.2 Weighted average discount rate 5.5 % 15 Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of June 30, 2019, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2019 (1) $ 826 2020 1,513 2021 833 2022 833 2023 833 Thereafter 4,687 Total lease payments 9,525 Less imputed interest ( 1,891 ) Present value of lease payments $ 7,634 (1) Scheduled maturities of lease liabilities represent the time-period of July 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2018, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were expected to be as follows (in thousands): Total Minimum Lease Payments 2019 $ 1,652 2020 1,512 2021 833 2022 833 2023 833 Thereafter 4,721 Total lease payments $ 10,384 9 . RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company funded OLED technology research at Princeton University and, on a subcontractor basis, at the University of Southern California for 10 years under a Research Agreement executed with Princeton University in August 1997 (the 1997 Research Agreement). The principal investigator conducting work under the 1997 Research Agreement transferred to the University of Michigan in January 2006. Following this transfer, the 1997 Research Agreement was allowed to expire on July 31, 2007. As a result of the transfer, the Company entered into a new Sponsored Research Agreement with the University of Southern California to sponsor OLED technology research and, on a subcontractor basis, with the University of Michigan. This new Sponsored Research Agreement (as amended, the 2006 Research Agreement) was effective as of May 1, 2006 and had an original term of three years . On May 1, 2009, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years . The 2006 Research Agreement superseded the 1997 Research Agreement with respect to all work being performed at the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan. Payments under the 2006 Research Agreement were made to the University of Southern California on a quarterly basis as actual expenses were incurred. The Company incurred a total of $ 5.0 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement during the extended term, which ended on April 30, 2013. Effective June 1, 2013, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years . The Company incurred a total of $ 4.6 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement during the extended term. Effective May 1, 2017, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement once again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional three years . As of June 30, 2019, in connection with this amendment, the Company was obligated to pay the University of Southern California up to $ 2.3 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term, which expires April 30, 2020. From May 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019, the Company incurred $ 2.1 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. 16 On October 9, 1997, the Company, Princeton University and the University of Southern California entered into an Amended License Agreement (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement) under which Princeton University and the University of Southern California granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed by Princeton University and the University of Southern California under the 1997 Research Agreement. Under this 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to pay Princeton University royalties for licensed products sold by the Company or its sublicensees. For licensed products sold by the Company, the Company is required to pay Princeton University 3 % of the net sales price of these products. For licensed products sold by the Company’s sublicensees, the Company is required to pay Princeton 3 % of the revenues received by the Company from these sublicensees. These royalty rates are subject to renegotiation for products not reasonably conceivable as arising out of the 1997 Research Agreement if Princeton University reasonably determines that the royalty rates payable with respect to these products are not fair and competitive. The Company is obligated, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to pay to Princeton University minimum annual royalties. The minimum royalty payment is $ 100,000 per year. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 3.5 million and $ 1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 6.0 million and $ 2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company also is required, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring the licensed OLED technology to market. However, this requirement is deemed satisfied if the Company invests a minimum of $ 800,000 per year in research, development, commercialization or patenting efforts respecting the patent rights licensed to the Company. In connection with entering into the 2006 Research Agreement, the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include the University of Michigan as a party to that agreement effective as of January 1, 2006. Under this amendment, Princeton University, the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan have granted the Company a worldwide exclusive license, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. The financial terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement were not impacted by this amendment. 10 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG Industries effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2019. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG Industries continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG Industries on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG Industries is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG Industries in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three or six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG Industries for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. The Company recorded a research and development expense of $ 288,000 and a credit of $ 161,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and expense of $ 362,000 and $ 200,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG Industries, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 17 1 1 . SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Common and Preferred Stock The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock and 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had issued 48,831,512 shares of common stock, of which 47,465,864 were outstanding and had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased no shares of common stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased 4,011 and 3,774 shares, respectively, of common stock, now held as treasury stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 649,000 and $ 477,000 , respectively. Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company granted a total of 1,960 and 2,456 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value of shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both six-month periods. Dividends During the three months ended June 30, 2019, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.10 per common share, or $ 4.7 million, and during the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.20 per common share, or $ 9.4 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On July 30, 2019 , the Company’s Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $ 0.10 per common share to be paid on September 30, 2019 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2019. All future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. 1 2 .

(2) Refer to Note 14: Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . 1 3 . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company recognizes in the statements of income the grant-date fair value of equity based awards, such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved, and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through June 30, 2019, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024. As of June 30, 2019, there were 2,327,687 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Stock Awards Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company granted 51,079 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $ 8.4 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 2.5 million and $ 1.9 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 631,000 and $ 509,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 269,000 and $ 186,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 4.9 million and $ 3.5 million, respectively, research and development expense of $ 1.2 million and $ 934,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 496,000 and $ 347,000 , respectively In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 52,611 and 52,874 shares, with aggregate fair values of $ 8.7 million and $ 5.2 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 78,342 and 80,147 shares, with aggregate fair values of $ 12.5 million and $ 8.6 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations. 19 For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, research and development expense of $ 131,000 and $ 41,000 , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, research and development expense of $ 413,000 and $ 116,000 , respectively. Board of Directors Compensation The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 237,000 and $ 1.1 million, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 471,000 and $ 2.1 million, respectively In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued 5,180 and 12,500 shares, during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Performance Unit Awards During the six months ended June 30, 2019, the Company granted 10,096 performance units, of which 5,050 are subject to a performance-based vesting and 5,046 are subject to a market-based vesting requirement and will vest over the terms described below. Total fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 2.0 million on the date of grant. Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's cumulative revenue growth or total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 11,000 and $ 519,000 , respectively, research and development expense of $ 3,000 and $ 128,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of none and $ 56,000 , respectively, related to performance units. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 277,000 and $ 945,000 , respectively, research and development expense of $ 68,000 and $ 232,000 , respectively, and cost of sales of $ 30,000 and $ 100,000 , respectively, related to performance units. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, 16,668 and 25,208 shares with an aggregate fair value of $ 2.6 million and $ 2.9 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. 20 Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued 4,360 and 5,532 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 445,000 and $ 434,000 , respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded charges of $ 25,000 and $ 24,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 33,000 and $ 33,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 18,000 and $ 19,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded charges of $ 47,000 and $ 41,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 64,000 and $ 56,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, and $ 38,000 and $ 33,000 , respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 1 4 . SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), effective as of April 1, 2010. On March 3, 2015, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors amended the SERP to include salary and bonus as part of the plan. Prior to this amendment, the SERP benefit did not take into account any bonuses. This change increased the liability for certain participants in the SERP. The purpose of the SERP, which is unfunded, is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental retirement benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of June 30, 2019, there were seven participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Service cost $ 227 $ 325 $ 515 $ 650 Interest cost 403 262 806 524 Amortization of prior service cost 399 421 798 842 Amortization of loss 410 118 821 236 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,439 $ 1,126 $ 2,940 $ 2,252 1 5 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 9 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 9 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and one employee which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment in connection with a change in control of the Company. If the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the officer and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. 21 In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 10) that allows PPG Industries to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 14.3 million and $ 15.9 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below are summaries of certain active proceedings that have been commenced against issued patents that are either exclusively licensed to the Company or which are now assigned to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceedings would have a material impact on the Company’s materials sales or licensing business or on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, including its consolidated statements of income, as a whole. However, as noted within the descriptions, some of the following proceedings involve issued patents that relate to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize the proceedings to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. The entry marked with an ""*"" relates to the Company’s UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technology, some of which may be commercialized by the Company. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The EPO combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under EPC Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and has appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid, and that all or a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. Opposition to European Patent No. 1933395* On February 24 and 27, 2012, Sumitomo, Merck Patent GmbH and BASF SE filed oppositions to the Company's European Patent No. 1933395 (the EP '395 patent). The EP ‘395 patent is a counterpart to the EP ‘637 patent, and, in part, to U.S. Patents 22 7,001,536, 6,902,830, and 6,830,828, and to JP patents 4358168 and 4357781. This patent is exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. At an Oral Hearing on October 14, 2013, the EPO panel issued a decision that affirmed the basic invention and broad patent coverage in the EP '395 patent, but narrowed the scope of the original claims. On February 26, 2014, the Company appealed the ruling to reinstate a broader set of claims. In the appeal proceedings of March 12, 2019, the appeal board remitted the case to the EPO Opposition Division with the order to maintain the patent claims as submitted via the Main Request during the appeal proceedings. The Opposition Division confirmed maintenance of the patent with claims as submitted via the Main Request during the appeal proceedings. These claims are now final, and the proceedings have been concluded. In addition to the above proceedings and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely utilized in the marketplace. 1 6 . CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Revenues for the Three months ended June 30, % of Revenues for the Six Months Ended June 30, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2019 2018 2019 2018 June 30, 2019 A 39 % 33 % 39 % 26 % $ 15,041 B 24 % 9 % 19 % 9 % $ 17,088 C 23 % 42 % 26 % 48 % $ 16,701 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97 % and 93 % of consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 97 % and 94 % of consolidated revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Country 2019 2018 2019 2018 South Korea $ 58,762 $ 42,132 $ 120,261 $ 72,906 China 54,972 8,479 75,750 17,331 Japan 818 686 2,665 1,561 Other non-U.S. locations 597 1,061 1,179 1,622 Total non-U.S. locations $ 115,149 $ 52,358 $ 199,855 $ 93,420 United States 3,019 3,791 6,078 6,301 Total revenue $ 118,168 $ 56,149 $ 205,933 $ 99,721 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 United States $ 78,115 $ 64,560 Other 5,480 5,179 Total long-lived assets $ 83,595 $ 69,739 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 10. 1 7 . INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 16.2 % and 14.6 % for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 16.1 % and 8.9 % for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $ 8.4 million and $ 1.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 14.4 million and $ 1.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09 of $ 1.4 million and $ 448,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $ 2.8 million and $ 1.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 23 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowances that relate to the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-US Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, the Company has decided to immediately litigate the Korean withholding taxes paid or withheld on the 2018 and 2019 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of June 30, 2019, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 20.2 million representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a tax expense of $ 2.1 million representing the allocation of withholding on Korean registered patents. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and R&D credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 balance sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) concluded a tax audit with LG Display (LGD) that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. As a result, a petition has been filed with the Tax Tribunal. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The above estimates may change in the future and ultimately upon settlement of these uncertain tax positions. 1 8 . REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Management is using the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded 98 % and 93 % of its revenue from sales of materials and 2 % and 7 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded 97 % and 94 % of its revenue from sales of materials and 3 % and 6 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): 24 As of June 30, 2019 Accounts receivable $ 66,952 Short-term unbilled receivables 730 Long-term unbilled receivables 575 Short-term deferred revenue 82,472 Long-term deferred revenue 44,651 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred revenue balance at June 30, 2019 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. The significant customer contracts (individually representing greater than 10% of revenue) expire in 2022 . As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $ 9.0 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances during the period are as follows (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 Unbilled Receivables Increase (Decrease) Deferred Revenue (Increase) Decrease Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ ( 122,567 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 63,337 Increases due to cash received — ( 68,213 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 320 Unbilled receivables recognized 1,064 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 779 ) — Net change 285 ( 4,556 ) Balance at June 30, 2019 $ 1,305 $ ( 127,123 ) 1 9 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share (""ASC 260""), which requires earnings per share for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholder’s proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP. 25 The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 43,440 $ 10,814 $ 74,914 $ 16,773 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 321 ) ( 122 ) ( 663 ) ( 217 ) Adjusted net income $ 43,119 $ 10,692 $ 74,251 $ 16,556 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 46,967,005 46,868,999 46,930,165 46,826,314 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 495 709 994 1,237 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 29,202 31,390 35,013 45,558 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 46,996,702 46,901,098 46,966,172 46,873,109 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.92 $ 0.23 $ 1.58 $ 0.35 Diluted $ 0.92 $ 0.23 $ 1.58 $ 0.35 For the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of none and 7,513 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of none and 3,541 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. The impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP, which was not significant, was excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 26 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions.

As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the section entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as supplemented by disclosures, if any, in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode, or OLED, technologies and materials for use in displays for mobile phones, televisions, tablets, wearables, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been exclusively engaged, and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • contract research services in the areas of organic and organometallic materials synthesis research, development and commercialization; and • technology development and support, including government contract work and support provided to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in 27 quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the term of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display's sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co. Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of June 30, 2019, Adesis employed a team of 95 research scientists, chemists, engineers, and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries providing contract research services to those third party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customer s. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which include reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur in relation to our government contracts. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. 28 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 118,168 $ 56,149 $ 62,019 COST OF SALES 24,072 11,635 12,437 Gross margin 94,096 44,514 49,582 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 18,833 12,949 5,884 Selling, general and administrative 15,939 11,562 4,377 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,490 5,495 (5 ) Patent costs 1,716 2,029 (313 ) Royalty and license expense 3,454 1,568 1,886 Total operating expenses 45,432 33,603 11,829 OPERATING INCOME 48,664 10,911 37,753 Interest income, net 2,757 1,766 991 Other income (expense), net 405 (12 ) 417 Interest and other income, net 3,162 1,754 1,408 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 51,826 12,665 39,161 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (8,386 ) (1,851 ) (6,535 ) NET INCOME $ 43,440 $ 10,814 $ 32,626 Revenue During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we recognized revenue of $118.2 million, an increase of $62.0 million from $56.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in revenue was due to higher material sales as a result of stronger demand in the OLED display market, as compared to that experienced during the three months ended June 30, 2018, as well as increased demand resulting from the impact of potential U.S. and China trade related concerns. We believe that certain of our customers located in China accelerated emitter purchases during the three months ended June 30, 2019 to mitigate this impact. We estimate that these pre-purchases increased revenue by $15 million to $20 million in the current quarter, pulled-in from the second half of 2019. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 98% of total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 93% for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Contract research services include revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which performs organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $12.4 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, was an increase in inventory reserve of $3.9 million and $183,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in material sales, gross margin for the three months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $49.6 million as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018 with gross margin as a percentage of revenue increasing to 80% from 79%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $18.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $12.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $15.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $11.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. 29 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Patent costs Patent costs decreased to $1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $3.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to the increase in available-for-sale investments held in the current quarter over amounts held in the comparable period in 2018. Other income (expense), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $405,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to other expense, net of $12,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2018. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 16.2% and 14.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $8.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09. Without the $1.4 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, for the three months ended June 30, 2019, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 18.9% and $9.8 million, respectively, and for the three months ended June 30, 2018, without the $448,000 benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 18.2% and $2.3 million, respectively.

The increase in revenue was due to higher material sales as a result of stronger demand in the OLED display market, as compared to that experienced during the six months ended June 30, 2018, as well as increased demand resulting from the impact of potential U.S. and China trade related concerns. We believe that certain of our customers located in China accelerated emitter purchases during the six months ended June 30, 2019 to mitigate this impact. We estimate that these pre-purchases increased revenue by $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter of 2019, pulled-in from the second half of 2019. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 97% of total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 94% for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Contract research services include revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which performs organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $20.8 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, was an increase in inventory reserve of $4.2 million and $183,000, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in material sales, gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2019 increased by $85.4 million as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018 with gross margin as a percentage of revenue remaining stable at 81%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $34.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $25.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $27.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $22.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $11.0 million for both of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. Patent costs Patent costs decreased to $3.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $3.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $6.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $3.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to the increase in available-for-sale investments held in the current year over amounts held in the comparable period in 2018. Other income (expense), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $687,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to other expense, net of $59,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2018. 31 Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 16.1% and 8.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $14.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09. Without the $2.8 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, for the six months ended June 30, 2019, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 19.3% and $17.2 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2018, without the $1.7 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 18.1% and $3.3 million, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $324.3 million and short-term investments of $228.4 million, for a total of $552.7 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $211.0 million and short-term investments of $304.3, for a total of $515.3 million, as of December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was $83.9 million resulting from $74.9 million of net income and $45.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $36.4 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $68.2 million, an increase in other liabilities of $6.1 million and a reduction of inventory of $5.7 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $23.8 million, an increase in other assets of $8.7 million, and a reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $2.1 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $50.0 million resulting from $16.8 million of net income, $19.6 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, and a $13.6 million increase due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, deferred income taxes and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $64.4 million, an increase in other liabilities of $18.3 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $16.8 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $19.8 million, an increase in other assets of $47.0 million, and a reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $13.1 million. Cash provided by investing activities was $53.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to cash used in investing of $62.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in cash provided by investing activities of $115.8 million was primarily due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales of $74.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to net purchases of $48.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, partially offset by an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $7.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2019 was primarily due to the purchase of additional property in Ewing, New Jersey as part of our plan to expand operations. Cash used in financing activities was $24.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to $16.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $7.4 million was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $3.8 million, an increase in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $3.4 million and an increase in the repurchase of common stock of $172,000, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $9,000. Working capital was $549.0 million as of June 30, 2019, compared to $501.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments and inventory, and an increase in other current liabilities. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. It should be noted, 32 however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of June 30, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2019. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 33 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of our goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and as our patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below are summaries of certain active proceedings that have been commenced against issued patents that are either exclusively licensed to us or which are now assigned to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceedings would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our consolidated financial statements, including our consolidated statements of income, as a whole. However, as noted within the descriptions, some of the following proceedings involve issued patents that relate to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize the proceedings to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. The entry marked with an ""*"" relates to our UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technology, some of which may be commercialized by us. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (EP '962 patent), which relates to our white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The EPO combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under EPC Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and we have appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. This patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid, and that all or a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. Opposition to European Patent No. 1933395* On February 24 and 27, 2012, Sumitomo, Merck Patent GmbH and BASF SE filed oppositions to our European Patent No. 1933395 (the EP '395 patent). The EP ‘395 patent is a counterpart patent to the EP ‘637 patent, and, in part, to the U.S. Patents 7,001,536, 6,902,830 and 6,830,828 and to JP patents 4358168 and 4357781. This patent is exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. 34 At an Oral Hearing on October 14, 2013, the EPO panel issued a decision that affirmed the basic invention and broad patent coverage in the EP '395 patent, but narrowed the scope of the original claims. On February 26, 2014, we appealed the ruling to reinstate a broader set of claims. In the appeal proceedings of March 12, 2019, the appeal board remitted the case to the EPO Opposition Division with the order to maintain the patent claims as submitted via the Main Request during the appeal proceedings. The Opposition Division confirmed maintenance of the patent with claims as submitted via the Main Request during the appeal proceedings. These claims are now final, and the proceedings have been concluded. In addition to the above proceedings and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely utilized in the marketplace.

SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company's technology leadership and intellectual property position should enable it to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they enter mainstream consumer and other markets. The Company's primary business strategy is to (1) further develop and license its proprietary OLED technologies to manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, tablets, wearables, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to those product manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining its relationships with world-class partners such as Princeton University (Princeton), the University of Southern California (USC), the University of Michigan (Michigan) and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG Industries). The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under its patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies who are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Interim Financial Information In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2019 and results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. While management believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in the Company’s latest year-end financial statements, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The results of the Company’s operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any other interim period or for the full year. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited, Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd. Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) and UDC Ventures LLC. UDC Ventures LLC was formed on March 1, 2019 as a corporate venture capital entity that will assist in funding companies that are developing innovative products and technologies that may be synergistic to those of the Company. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 6 Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments, lease liabilities, right-of use assets and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying financial statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities. As discussed in Note 8, effective January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases . At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities and the long-term portion is included in non-current other liabilities. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Minority Equity Investments The cost method of accounting is used for investments in companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value in which the Company holds an interest of less than 20% and over which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in this assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had no minority equity investments. 7 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. These agreements are combined and the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. Total contract consideration includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees as well as estimates of material fees and royalties to be earned. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process and related amounts to be charged. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis through performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which includes reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs in relation to its government contracts. Revenues are recognized proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved, and are included in contract research services in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights 8 under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additio nally, the Company suppl ies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company expects to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. The Company records taxes billed to customers and remitted to various governmental entities on a gross basis in both revenues and cost of material sales in the consolidated statements of income. The amounts of these pass through taxes reflected in revenues and cost of material sales were $38,000 and $6,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All sales transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years. See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the consolidated statements of income from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. 9 Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50%. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the consolidated statements of income the grant-date fair value of equity based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which addresses the classification and recognition of lease assets and liabilities formerly classified as operating leases under generally accepted accounting principles. The guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition and measurement, and quantitative and qualitative aspects of presentation and disclosure. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the standard beginning January 1, 2019 using the “modified retrospective” approach, meaning the standard was applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements and have applied all practical expedients related to leases existing at the date of initial application including the exception for short-term leases. Adoption of the new standard resulted in an increase in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of $8.3 million based on the present value of the future minimum rental payments for existing operating leases. The Company has no leases that qualify as financing arrangements. See Note 8 for additional information. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2017-04 may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 10 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Investments as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 consisted of the following (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Investment Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value March 31, 2019 Certificates of deposit $ 1,100 $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 1,100 U.S. Government bonds 437,132 21 (9 ) 437,144 $ 438,232 $ 22 $ (10 ) $ 438,244 December 31, 2018 Certificates of deposit $ 500 $ — $ (1 ) $ 499 Corporate bonds 114,678 1 (19 ) 114,660 U.S. Government bonds 317,984 14 (43 ) 317,955 $ 433,162 $ 15 $ (63 ) $ 433,114 As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, there was $136.7 million and $128.8 million of U.S. Government bonds included in cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2019 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total carrying value as of March 31, 2019 Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 145,230 $ 145,230 $ — $ — Short-term investments 301,549 301,549 — — The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total carrying value as of December 31, 2018 Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 139,805 $ 139,805 $ — $ — Short-term investments 304,323 304,323 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income. If a decline in fair value of an investment is deemed to be other than temporary, the cost of the Company’s investment will be written down by the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment with a resulting charge to net income. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments as of March 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018. 11 5. INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Raw materials $ 34,600 $ 31,203 Work-in-process 205 781 Finished goods 33,236 38,016 Inventory $ 68,041 $ 70,000 For the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $224,000 due to excess inventory levels in certain products. No change in inventory reserve was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2018. 6. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment, net consist of the following (in thousands): March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Land $ 2,642 $ 1,006 Building and improvements 46,304 39,285 Office and lab equipment 57,753 55,333 Furniture, fixtures and computer related assets 6,983 6,941 Construction-in-progress 14,634 12,117 128,316 114,682 Less: Accumulated depreciation (47,701 ) (44,943 ) Property and equipment, net $ 80,615 $ 69,739 Depreciation expense was $2.8 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company purchased property in Ewing, New Jersey, adjacent to its headquarters, as part of its plan to expand operations. The new facilities added approximately 88,000 square feet at a cost of $8.2 million and will allow for the expansion of research and development activities, manufacturing logistics and other corporate functions. 7 . GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of acquired technology and other intangible assets that include trade names, customer relationships and developed IP processes. Acquired Technology Acquired technology consists of acquired license rights for patents and know-how obtained from PD-LD, Inc., Motorola, BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm. These intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): March 31, 2019 PD-LD, Inc. $ 1,481 Motorola 15,909 BASF 95,989 Fujifilm 109,462 Other 401 223,242 Less: Accumulated amortization (117,034 ) Acquired technology, net $ 106,208 Amortization expense related to acquired technology was $5.1 million for both three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the consolidated statements of income and is expected to be $20.6 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2019 through 2021, $15.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2022, $9.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2023 and $24.1 million thereafter. 12 Motorola Patent Acquisition In 2000, the Company entered into a royalty-bearing license agreement with Motorola whereby Motorola granted the Company perpetual license rights to what are now 74 issued U.S. patents relating to Motorola’s OLED technologies, together with foreign counterparts in various countries. The last of the issued U.S. patents expired in 2018. On March 9, 2011, the Company purchased these patents from Motorola, including all existing and future claims and causes of action for any infringement of the patents, pursuant to a Patent Purchase Agreement. The Patent Purchase Agreement effectively terminated the Company’s license agreement with Motorola, including any obligation to make royalty payments to Motorola. The technology acquired from Motorola is being amortized over a period of 7.5 years. Fujifilm Patent Acquisition On July 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Patent Sale Agreement with Fujifilm. Under the agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $105.0 million, plus costs incurred in connection with the purchase. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The agreement permitted the Company to assign all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to its affiliates, and the Company assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement, its rights and obligations to UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. The Company recorded the $105.0 million plus $4.5 million of purchase costs as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition of, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $217,000 as acquired technology which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $4.8 million of internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $1.5 million assigned to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years. At March 31, 2019, these other intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Customer relationships $ 10,520 $ (2,454 ) $ 8,066 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 (867 ) 3,953 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 (405 ) 1,095 Total identifiable intangible assets $ 16,840 $ (3,726 ) $ 13,114 Amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $342,000 for both three month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in the amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $1.4 million for each of the next five fiscal years (2019-2023) and $6.5 million thereafter. 8. LEASES: The Company has entered operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing operations and research and development facilities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not 13 readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present v alue of the lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date . Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of March 31, 2019, the Company d id not have any financ e leases and no additional operating leases that ha d not yet commenced. As stated in Note 2, effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842 using the modified retrospective transition method. As such, the Company did not restate financial statement or lease disclosure data for periods prior to January 1, 2019, which was prepared in accordance with ASC Topic 840 – Leases . The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 430 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations 8,273 As of March 31, 2019, current operating leases had remaining terms between 1 and 9 years with options to extend the lease terms and the Company had operating lease right-of-use assets of $8.0 million, current operating lease liabilities of $1.3 million and long-term operating lease liabilities of $6.7 million. The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: March 31, 2019 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.3 Weighted average discount rate 5.5 % Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of March 31, 2019, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2019 (1) $ 1,222 2020 1,512 2021 833 2022 833 2023 833 Thereafter 4,721 Total lease payments 9,954 Less imputed interest (1,998 ) Present value of lease payments $ 7,956 (1) Scheduled maturities of lease liabilities represent the time-period of April 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2018, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were expected to be as follows (in thousands): Total Minimum Lease Payments 2019 $ 1,652 2020 1,512 2021 833 2022 833 2023 833 Thereafter 4,721 Total lease payments $ 10,384 Operating lease cost was $1.7 million in 2018. 14 9 . RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company funded OLED technology research at Princeton University and, on a subcontractor basis, at the University of Southern California for 10 years under a Research Agreement executed with Princeton University in August 1997 (the 1997 Research Agreement). The principal investigator conducting work under the 1997 Research Agreement transferred to the University of Michigan in January 2006. Following this transfer, the 1997 Research Agreement was allowed to expire on July 31, 2007. As a result of the transfer, the Company entered into a new Sponsored Research Agreement with the University of Southern California to sponsor OLED technology research and, on a subcontractor basis, with the University of Michigan. This new Sponsored Research Agreement (as amended, the 2006 Research Agreement) was effective as of May 1, 2006 and had an original term of three years. On May 1, 2009, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years. The 2006 Research Agreement superseded the 1997 Research Agreement with respect to all work being performed at the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan. Payments under the 2006 Research Agreement were made to the University of Southern California on a quarterly basis as actual expenses were incurred. The Company incurred a total of $5.0 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement during the extended term, which ended on April 30, 2013. Effective June 1, 2013, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years. The Company incurred a total of $4.6 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement during the extended term. Effective May 1, 2017, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement once again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional three years. As of March 31, 2019, in connection with this amendment, the Company was obligated to pay the University of Southern California up to $3.9 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term, which expires April 30, 2020. From May 1, 2017 through March 31, 2019, the Company incurred $1.8 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. On October 9, 1997, the Company, Princeton University and the University of Southern California entered into an Amended License Agreement (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement) under which Princeton University and the University of Southern California granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed by Princeton University and the University of Southern California under the 1997 Research Agreement. Under this 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to pay Princeton University royalties for licensed products sold by the Company or its sublicensees. For licensed products sold by the Company, the Company is required to pay Princeton University 3% of the net sales price of these products. For licensed products sold by the Company’s sublicensees, the Company is required to pay Princeton 3% of the revenues received by the Company from these sublicensees. These royalty rates are subject to renegotiation for products not reasonably conceivable as arising out of the 1997 Research Agreement if Princeton University reasonably determines that the royalty rates payable with respect to these products are not fair and competitive. The Company is obligated, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to pay to Princeton University minimum annual royalties. The minimum royalty payment is $100,000 per year. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $2.5 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company also is required, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring the licensed OLED technology to market. However, this requirement is deemed satisfied if the Company invests a minimum of $800,000 per year in research, development, commercialization or patenting efforts respecting the patent rights licensed to the Company. In connection with entering into the 2006 Research Agreement, the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include the University of Michigan as a party to that agreement effective as of January 1, 2006. Under this amendment, Princeton University, the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan have granted the Company a worldwide exclusive license, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. The financial terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement were not impacted by this amendment. 15 10 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG Industries effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2019. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG Industries continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG Industries on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50% of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG Industries is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $20.00, the Company is required to compensate PPG Industries in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the three months ended March 31, 2019 or 2018. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG Industries for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. The Company recorded research and development expense of $74,000 and $361,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG Industries, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 1 1 . SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY: Common and Preferred Stock The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value common stock and 5,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had issued 48,760,311 shares of common stock, of which 47,394,663 were outstanding and had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 4,011 shares of common stock, now held as treasury stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $649,000. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 3,774 shares of common stock, now held as treasury stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $477,000. Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company granted a total of 1,960 and 2,456 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value of shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $300,000 for both three-month periods. Dividends During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $0.10 per common share, or $4.7 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On April 30, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.10 per common share to be paid on June 28, 2019. All future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. 16 1 2 . ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS: Amounts related to the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows (in thousands): Unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale-securities Net unrealized gain (loss) on retirement plan (2) Change in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment Total Affected line items in the consolidated statements of operations Balance December 31, 2018, net of tax $ 10 $ (16,198 ) $ (46 ) $ (16,234 ) Other comprehensive gain (loss) before reclassification 47 — 33 80 Reclassification to net income (1) — 634 — 634 Selling, general and administrative, research and development, and cost of sales Change during period 47 634 33 714 Balance March 31, 2019, net of tax $ 57 $ (15,564 ) $ (13 ) $ (15,520 ) Unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale-securities Net unrealized gain (loss) on retirement plan (2) Change in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment Total Affected line items in the consolidated statements of operations Balance December 31, 2017, net of tax $ (258 ) $ (11,169 ) $ (37 ) $ (11,464 ) Other comprehensive gain (loss) before reclassification 54 — 20 74 Reclassification to net income (1) — 422 — 422 Selling, general and administrative, research and development, and cost of sales Change during period 54 422 20 496 Balance March 31, 2018, net of tax $ (204 ) $ (10,747 ) $ (17 ) $ (10,968 ) (1) The Company reclassified amortization of prior service cost and actuarial loss for its retirement plan from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income of $634,000 and $422,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (2) Refer to Note 14: Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. 1 3 . STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company recognizes in the statements of income the grant-date fair value of equity based awards, such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved, and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through March 31, 2019, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity 17 Compensation Plan to 10,500,000, and have extended the term of the plan through 2024 . As of March 31 , 201 9 , there were 2,346,225 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Stock Awards Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company granted 32,041 shares of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees and non-employees, which had a total fair value of $4.9 million on the respective dates of grant, and will vest over three to five years from the date of grant, provided that the grantee is still an employee of the Company or is still providing services to the Company on the applicable vesting date. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $2.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, research and development expense of $546,000 and $426,000, respectively, and cost of sales of $227,000 and $160,000, respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, 25,731 and 27,273 shares, with aggregate fair values of $3.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, research and development expense of $282,000 and credit of $157,000, respectively. Board of Directors Compensation The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $234,000 and $1.1 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued 2,590 and 6,250 shares, during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Performance Unit Awards During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Company granted 10,096 performance units, of which 5,046 are subject to a performance-based vesting and 5,050 are subject to a market-based vesting requirement and will vest over the terms described below. Total fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $2.0 million on the date of grant. Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's cumulative revenue growth or total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. 18 For the thr ee months ended March 31 , 201 9 and 201 8 , the Company recorded selling, general and administrative expense of $ 266 , 000 and $ 4 25 ,000 , respectively, research and development expense of $ 65 , 000 and $ 1 0 5 ,000, respectively, and cost of sales of $ 29 , 000 and $ 44 ,000, respectively, related to performance units. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, 16,668 and 25,208 shares with an aggregate fair value of $2.6 million and $2.9 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85% of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10% of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued 2,571 and 2,345 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $204,000 and $201,000, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded charges of $22,000 and $17,000, respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $32,000 and $22,000, respectively, to research and development expense, and $19,000 and $13,000, respectively, to cost of sales related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 1 4 . SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN: On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), effective as of April 1, 2010. On March 3, 2015, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors amended the SERP to include salary and bonus as part of the plan. Prior to this amendment, the SERP benefit did not take into account any bonuses. This change increased the liability for certain participants in the SERP. The purpose of the SERP, which is unfunded, is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental retirement benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of March 31, 2019, there were seven participants in the SERP. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Service cost $ 288 $ 325 Interest cost 403 262 Amortization of prior service cost 399 421 Amortization of loss 411 118 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 1,501 $ 1,126 19 1 5 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 9 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 9 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and one employee which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment in connection with a change in control of the Company. If the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the officer and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 10) that allows PPG Industries to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $17.6 million and $15.9 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below are summaries of certain active proceedings that have been commenced against issued patents that are either exclusively licensed to the Company or which are now assigned to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceedings would have a material impact on the Company’s materials sales or licensing business or on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, including its consolidated statements of income, as a whole. However, as noted within the descriptions, some of the following proceedings involve issued patents that relate to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize the proceedings to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. The entries marked with an ""*"" relate to the Company’s UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technology, some of which may be commercialized by the Company. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 20 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,3 38 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The EPO combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under EPC Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and has appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid, and that all or a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. Opposition to European Patent No. 1933395* On February 24 and 27, 2012, Sumitomo, Merck Patent GmbH and BASF SE filed oppositions to the Company's European Patent No. 1933395 (the EP '395 patent). The EP ‘395 patent is a counterpart to the EP ‘637 patent, and, in part, to U.S. Patents 7,001,536, 6,902,830, and 6,830,828, and to JP patents 4358168 and 4357781. This patent is exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. At an Oral Hearing on October 14, 2013, the EPO panel issued a decision that affirmed the basic invention and broad patent coverage in the EP '395 patent, but narrowed the scope of the original claims. On February 26, 2014, the Company appealed the ruling to reinstate a broader set of claims. In the appeal proceedings of March 12, 2019, the appeal board remitted the case to the EPO Opposition Division with the order to maintain the patent claims as submitted via the Main Request during the appeal proceedings. These claims are now final. In addition to the above proceedings and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely utilized in the marketplace. 1 6 . CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Revenues and accounts receivable from the Company's largest customers were as follows (in thousands): % of Revenues for the three months ended March 31, Accounts Receivable as of Customer 2019 2018 March 31, 2019 A 40% 16% $ 12,012 B 30% 55% $ 25,042 C 13% 11% $ 7,383 Revenues from outside of North America represented approximately 97% and 94% of consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenues by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, Country 2019 2018 South Korea $ 61,499 $ 30,774 China 20,778 8,852 Japan 1,846 875 Other non-U.S. locations 583 561 Total non-U.S. locations $ 84,706 $ 41,062 United States 3,059 2,510 Total revenue $ 87,765 $ 43,572 The Company attributes revenue to different geographic areas on the basis of the location of the customer. 21 Long-lived assets (net), by geographic area are as follows (in thousands): March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 United States $ 75,160 $ 64,560 Other 5,455 5,179 Total long-lived assets $ 80,615 $ 69,739 Substantially all chemical materials were purchased from one supplier. See Note 10. 1 7 . INCOME TAXES: The Company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 16.0% and a benefit of 3.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $6.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and an income tax benefit of $216,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09 of $1.5 million and $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowances that relate to the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-US Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this recent decision, the Company has decided to immediately litigate the Korean withholding on the 2018 and 2019 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $17.0 million representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a tax expense of $1.6 million representing the allocation of withholding on Korean registered patents. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the MAP which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term receivable of $36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and R&D credits of $20.7 million has been recorded on the December 31, 2018 balance sheet for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) concluded a tax audit with LG Display (LGD) that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. As a result, a petition has been filed with the Tax Tribunal. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of December 31, 2018. The above estimates may change in the future and ultimately upon settlement of these uncertain tax positions 1 8 . REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined 22 agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consid eration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Management is using the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded 97% and 94% of its revenue from sales of materials and 3% and 6% from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of March 31, 2019 Accounts receivable $ 52,124 Short-term unbilled receivables 241 Long-term unbilled receivables — Short-term deferred revenue 86,296 Long-term deferred revenue 41,596 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred revenue balance at March 31, 2019 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. The significant customer contracts (individually representing greater than 10% of revenue) expire in 2022. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had $7.1 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances during the period are as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Unbilled Receivables Increase (Decrease) Deferred Revenue (Increase) Decrease Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ (122,567 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 27,596 Increases due to cash received — (33,080 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 159 Unbilled receivables recognized — — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables (779 ) — Net change (779 ) (5,325 ) Balance at March 31, 2019 $ 241 $ (127,892 ) 1 9 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share (""ASC 260""), which requires earnings per share for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholder’s proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. 23 For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to in clude the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 31,474 $ 5,959 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders (325 ) (87 ) Adjusted net income $ 31,149 $ 5,872 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 46,892,914 46,783,158 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 800 837 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 38,285 64,803 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 46,931,999 46,848,798 Net income per common share: Basic $ 0.66 $ 0.13 Diluted $ 0.66 $ 0.13 For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 1,157 and none, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. The impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP, which was not significant, was excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 24 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes above. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This discussion and analysis contains some “forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements concern possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategies and customer relationships. These statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “seek,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry, as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors that we believe are appropriate in these circumstances. As you read and consider this discussion and analysis, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that these statements involve substantial risk and uncertainty and are not guarantees of future performance or results. They depend on many factors that are discussed further in the section entitled (Risk Factors) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as supplemented by disclosures, if any, in Item 1A of Part II below. Changes or developments in any of these areas could affect our financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be. We do not undertake any duty to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode, or OLED, technologies and materials for use in displays for mobile phones, televisions, tablets, wearables, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been exclusively engaged, and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • contract research services in the areas of organic and organometallic materials synthesis research, development and commercialization; and • technology development and support, including government contract work and support provided to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in 25 quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's i ntellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the term of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display's sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co. Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company expects to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organ ization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of March 31, 2019, Adesis employed a team of 89 research scientists, chemists, engineers, and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries providing contract research services to those third party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customer s. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which include reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur in relation to our government contracts. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. 26 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 87,765 $ 43,572 $ 44,193 COST OF SALES 15,814 7,458 8,356 Gross margin 71,951 36,114 35,837 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 15,829 12,357 3,472 Selling, general and administrative 11,969 10,791 1,178 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 5,486 5,491 (5 ) Patent costs 1,770 1,725 45 Royalty and license expense 2,537 1,231 1,306 Total operating expenses 37,591 31,595 5,996 OPERATING INCOME 34,360 4,519 29,841 Interest income, net 2,831 1,271 1,560 Other income (expense), net 282 (47 ) 329 Interest and other income, net 3,113 1,224 1,889 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 37,473 5,743 31,730 INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT (5,999 ) 216 (6,215 ) NET INCOME $ 31,474 $ 5,959 $ 25,515 Revenue During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recognized revenue of $87.8 million, an increase of $44.2 million from $43.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in revenue was due to higher material sales as a result of stronger demand in the OLED display market, as compared to the weakness experienced in the mobile display market segment during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 97% of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to 94% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Contract research services include revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which performs organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customers. Cost of sales Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased by $8.4 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was an excess and obsolete charge of $224,000 due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in material sales, gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased by $35.8 million as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018 with gross margin as a percentage of sales decreasing to 82% from 83%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $15.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $12.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $12.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $10.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $5.5 million for both of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. 27 Patent costs Patent costs increased to $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $1.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income (expense), net Interest income, net was $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to the increase in available-for-sale investments held in the current quarter over amounts held in the comparable period in 2018. Other income (expense), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $282,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to other expense, net of $47,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Income tax (expense) benefit We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 16.0% and a benefit of 3.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $6.0 million and income tax benefit of $216,000, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09. Without the $1.5 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, for the three months ended March 31, 2019, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 20.0% and $7.5 million, respectively, and for the three months ended March 31, 2018, without the $1.3 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 19.0% and $1.1 million, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our investments. As of March 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $225.0 million and short-term investments of $301.6 million, for a total of $526.6 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $211.0 million and short-term investments of $304.3, for a total of $515.3 million, as of December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $34.1 million resulting from $31.5 million of net income and $17.8 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $15.2 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $33.1 million and a reduction of inventory of $1.7 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $9.0 million, a reduction of accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $5.2 million and an increase in other assets of $2.8 million Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $38.8 million resulting from $6.0 million of net income, $33.9 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $1.1 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $30.3 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $29.6 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $17.4 million, an increase in other assets of $4.2 million, and a reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.4 million. 28 Cash used in investing activities was $ 9 . 1 million for the three months ended March 3 1 , 201 9 , as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $ 14 . 5 million for the three months ended March 31 , 201 8 . The in crease in cash used by investing activities of $ 23. 5 million was primarily due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales of $ 4.6 million for the three months ended March 31 , 201 9 , as compared to net sales of $ 2 3. 2 million for the three months ended March 31 , 201 8 , and a n in crease in purchases of intangibles and pro perty, plant and equipment of $ 5 . 0 million f or the three months ended March 31 , 201 9 compa r ed to the three months ended March 31 , 2018 . The in cr ease in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2019 was primarily due to the purchase of additional property in Ewing, N ew J ersey as part of our plan to expand operations. Cash used in financing activities was $10.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, as compared to $8.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $2.0 million was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $1.9 million and an increase in the repurchase of common stock of $172,000, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $75,000 and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $3,000. Working capital was $520.6 million as of March 31, 2019, compared to $501.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue and other current liabilities. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories, and income taxes are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies. Contractual Obligations Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a discussion of our contractual obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of March 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 29 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2019. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II – OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of our goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and as our patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below are summaries of certain active proceedings that have been commenced against issued patents that are either exclusively licensed to us or which are now assigned to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceedings would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our consolidated financial statements, including our consolidated statements of income, as a whole. However, as noted within the descriptions, some of the following proceedings involve issued patents that relate to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize the proceedings to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the 30 patented invention fr om any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. The entries marked with an ""*"" relate to our UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technology, some of whi ch may b e commercialized by us. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (EP '962 patent), which relates to our white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The EPO combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under EPC Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and we have appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. This patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid, and that all or a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. Opposition to European Patent No. 1933395* On February 24 and 27, 2012, Sumitomo, Merck Patent GmbH and BASF SE filed oppositions to our European Patent No. 1933395 (the EP '395 patent). The EP ‘395 patent is a counterpart patent to the EP ‘637 patent, and, in part, to the U.S. Patents 7,001,536, 6,902,830 and 6,830,828 and to JP patents 4358168 and 4357781. This patent is exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. At an Oral Hearing on October 14, 2013, the EPO panel issued a decision that affirmed the basic invention and broad patent coverage in the EP '395 patent, but narrowed the scope of the original claims. On February 26, 2014, we appealed the ruling to reinstate a broader set of claims. In the appeal proceedings of March 12, 2019, the appeal board remitted the case to the EPO Opposition Division with the order to maintain the patent claims as submitted via the Main Request during the appeal proceedings. These claims are now final. In addition to the above proceedings and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely utilized in the marketplace.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. (“Novanta” or the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in precision medicine and manufacturing, medical solutions, and robotics and automation with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company changed the names of its reportable segments from “Photonics” to “Precision Medicine and Manufacturing”, from “Vision” to “Medical Solutions”, and from “Precision Motion” to “Robotics and Automation”, respectively. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the compositions of the Company's segments and therefore did not result in any change to historical results. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-06, “Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative.” ASU 2023-06 clarifies or improves disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of topics, which allow users to easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements and align the requirements in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification with the SEC’s regulations. The effective date for each amendment in ASU 2023-06 will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-06 on its consolidated financial statements. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 (Unaudited) 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time. As the Company’s right to payment from a customer is based on the value of engineering services performed, the Company recognizes revenue based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Revenue from engineering services aggregated to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The standard warranty periods for the Company’s products are typically 12 months to 36 months . The Company recognizes estimated liabilities associated with standard warranty periods for its products in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liabilities and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liabilities. A provision for the estimated cost related to standard warranties is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of the costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities are recorded at that time, with offsetting adjustments to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the expected amortization period is typically one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 (Unaudited) Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of September 29, 2023 and December 31, 2022, contract liabilities were $ 6.8 million and $ 8.4 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 is primarily due to $ 6.2 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2022, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 15 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Loss Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2022 $ ( 32,009 ) $ ( 24,427 ) $ ( 7,582 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 2,068 ) ( 1,980 ) ( 88 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 764 — 764 Balance at September 29, 2023 $ ( 33,313 ) $ ( 26,407 ) $ ( 6,906 ) The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 4. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. The dilutive effects of outstanding common share equivalents, including outstanding service-based restricted stock units, stock options and performance-based restricted stock units, are determined using the treasury stock method. Performance-based restricted stock units are considered contingently issuable shares, the vesting of which may be based on achievement of specified company performance conditions (“attainment-based PSUs”), certain market conditions (“market-based PSUs”) or a hybrid of company performance conditions and market conditions (“hybrid PSUs”). The dilutive effects of market-based PSUs are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. The dilutive effects of attainment-based and hybrid PSUs are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets only when the performance targets have been achieved as of the end of the reporting period. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 (Unaudited) The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 29, September 30, September 29, September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 21,223 $ 22,490 $ 60,367 $ 58,789 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,856 35,729 35,839 35,625 Dilutive potential common shares 185 199 185 256 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 36,041 35,928 36,024 35,881 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 49 73 101 104 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.59 $ 0.63 $ 1.68 $ 1.65 Diluted $ 0.59 $ 0.63 $ 1.68 $ 1.64 For both the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 , 143 thousand shares of performance-based restricted stock units were excluded from the calculation of the denominator because they were attainment-based and hybrid contingently issuable shares and the related performance targets had not been achieved as of September 29, 2023. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , 124 thousand shares of performance-based restricted stock units were excluded from the calculation of the denominator because they were attainment-based contingently issuable shares and the related performance targets had not been achieved as of September 30, 2022 . 5. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 (Unaudited) Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES ”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). During 2021, the Company made the first installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2021 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 3.3 million ($ 3.8 million) as of December 31, 2021. During 2022, the Company made the second installment payment of € 0.3 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2022 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million). During the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the Company made the third installment payment of € 0.1 million ($ 0.1 million). The installment payments have been reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections as of September 29, 2023, the Company did no t make any adjustments to the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration during the nine months ended September 29, 2023.

Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures and are included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of September 29, 2023, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 163.5 million and a net gain of $ 0.2 million, respective ly. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 117.1 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net loss of $ 0.2 million and aggregate net gain of $ 2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net loss of $ 0.8 million and $ 2.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively . 11 NOVANTA INC.

The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 10. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2023 and 2036 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to ten years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewal options to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms.

Preferred and Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Preferred Shares In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares, fix the rights, preferences and designation, as deemed necessary or advisable, relating to the preferred shares, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share . As of September 29, 2023 , no preferred shares had been issued and outstanding. Common Share Repurchases In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of $ 50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , the Company repurchased 4 thousand shares under the 2020 Repurchase Plan for an aggregate purchase price of $ 0.5 million and an average price of $ 116.95 per share. During the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of September 29, 2023 , the Company had $ 49.5 million available for future share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 29, September 30, September 29, September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Selling, general and administrative $ 5,229 $ 4,649 $ 15,631 $ 13,906 Research and development and engineering 510 586 1,495 1,780 Cost of revenue 298 719 1,252 2,123 Total share-based compensation expense $ 6,037 $ 5,954 $ 18,378 $ 17,809 Share-based compensation expense reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 1.2 million and $ 1.1 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis 17 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 (Unaudited) over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. Outstanding DSUs are converted into common shares upon Board members' resignation or retirement from the Board. There were 41 thousand and 38 thousand DSUs outstanding as of September 29, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Outstanding DSUs are included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 29, 2023: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2022 238 $ 128.26 Granted 91 $ 156.47 Vested ( 102 ) $ 122.48 Forfeited ( 24 ) $ 139.50 Unvested at September 29, 2023 203 $ 142.72 Expected to vest as of September 29, 2023 185 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 was $ 15.2 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants performance-based restricted stock unit awards (“PSUs”) that are based on the Company's financial metrics, market conditions, or a hybrid of financial metrics and market conditions. These performance stock unit awards generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the specified performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of attainment-based PSUs is determined based on the Company’s financial metrics over the specified performance period against the targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the specified performance period. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of market-based PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the specified performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the market-based PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the specified performance period. Compensation expense on market-based PSUs will not be affected by the number of shares that will ultimately vest at the end of the specified performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of PSU awards that are based on the achievement of a hybrid of financial metrics and market conditions (“Hybrid PSUs”) is determined based on the Company's financial metrics achieved over the specified performance period against the targets established by the Company's Board of Directors at the time of grant with a market condition multiplier and will be in the range of zero to 260 % of the target number of shares. The Company determines the fair value of these Hybrid PSUs using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the Hybrid PSUs ratably over the performance period based on the fair value of the PSUs as of the grant date and the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the specified performance period. The probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. 18 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 29, 2023: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2022 216 $ 144.16 Granted 57 $ 179.15 Performance adjustments (1) 20 $ 122.24 Vested ( 70 ) $ 116.56 Forfeited ( 16 ) $ 168.97 Unvested at September 29, 2023 207 $ 160.40 Expected to vest as of September 29, 2023 246 (1) The amount shown represents performance adjustments related to the performance-based awards granted on February 20, 2020. These performance-based awards vested at a blended payout of 142 % during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions, respectively, over the performance period of fiscal years 2020 through 2022. The unvested PSUs are shown at target payout levels in the table above. As of September 29, 2023 , the maximum number of common shares that could be earned under these PSU grants was approximately 369 thousand shares. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 was $ 9.9 million based on the market price of the underlying common shares on the date of vesting. The grant-date fair value of the hybrid PSUs granted during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method with the following assumptions: Nine Months Ended September 29, 2023 Grant-date stock price $ 156.72 Expected volatility 35.89 % Risk-free interest rate 4.44 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 181.45 Stock Options In February 2023, the Company granted 48 thousand nonqualified stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a strike price equal to the closing market price on the date of grant. The stock options vest ratably over three years on the anniversary of the date of grant and expire on the seven th anniversary of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in the consolidated statement of operations. 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes the activities relating to stock options issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 29, 2023: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 84 $ 72.18 Granted 48 $ 156.72 Exercised — $ — Forfeited or expired — $ — Outstanding as of September 29, 2023 132 $ 102.86 Exercisable as of September 29, 2023 57 Expected to vest as of September 29, 2023 75 The aggregate Black-Scholes fair value of $ 3.0 million for the stock options granted during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 was estimated using the following assumptions as of the grant date: Nine Months Ended September 29, 2023 Expected option term in years 4.5 Expected volatility 40.7 % Risk-free interest rate 4.00 % Expected annual dividend yield — The expected option term was calculated using the simplified method permitted under Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins Topic 14, “Share-Based Payment”. The expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common shares over the expected option term. The risk-free interest rate was based on treasury instrument whose term was six months longer than the expected option term. The expected annual dividend yield is zero as the Company does not have plans to issue dividends. 12. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the period in which the changes are determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses, credits and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are not more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of adding a new or additional valuation allowance or releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. The Company’s effective tax rate of 7.7 % for the three months ended September 29, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and tax benefits of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2023 (Unaudited) The Company’s effective tax rate of 11.2 % for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and tax benefits of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. For the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the tax benefits of share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 4.5 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of 16.0 % for the three months ended September 30, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and R&D tax credits, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. The Company’s effective tax rate of 13.8 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and tax benefits of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the tax benefits of share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 0.2 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. 13.

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2022. Business Interruption Insurance Recoveries The Company made an insurance claim to recover lost margin and additional costs incurred in connection with a fire at a key supplier that caused business interruption in the second half of 2022. During the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023, the Company received insurance recovery payments of $ 4.4 million and $ 5.0 million, respectively, which have been recorded as a reduction to cost of revenue. The insurance claim was fully settled as of September 29, 2023. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is considered reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the potential loss or a range of potential losses, if such an estimate can be reasonably made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of outstanding claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products, and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director or officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding by reason of their relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors and officers liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 15. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes certain financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.

(the “Company”, “Novanta”, “we”, “us”, “our”) are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, except for the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Business Overview We are a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in precision medicine and manufacturing, medical solutions, and robotics and automation with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. During the first quarter of 2023, we changed the names of our reportable segments from “Photonics” to “Precision Medicine and Manufacturing”, from “Vision” to “Medical Solutions”, and from “Precision Motion” to “Robotics and Automation”, respectively. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the compositions of our segments and therefore did not result in any change to historical results. Reportable Segments We operate in three reportable segments: Precision Medicine and Manufacturing, Medical Solutions, and Robotics and Automation. The reportable segments and their principal activities are summarized below. Precision Medicine and Manufacturing Our Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures, particularly ophthalmology applications. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Medical Solutions Our Medical Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless technologies, video recorder and video integration technologies for operating room integrations; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies; and embedded touch screen solutions. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Robotics and Automation Our Robotics and Automation segment designs, manufactures and markets optical and inductive encoders, precision motors, servo drives and motion control solutions, integrated stepper motors, intelligent robotic end-of-arm technology solutions, air bearings, and air bearing spindles to customers worldwide. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the medical market accounted for approximately 54% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes 28 in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 46% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by several factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial conditions of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the PMI on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: Significant Events and Updates Business Environment Global Supply Chain Disruptions Over the past three years, we experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers could further challenge our ability to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of supply chain interruptions, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising quality and performance, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays for obtaining raw materials from suppliers. Our supply chain disruptions and customer orders to secure supply caused 29 significantly elevated customer order backlog levels in the last two years. Although we have seen some decrease in our backlog coverage levels throughout the year, they are still higher than average historical levels and we anticipate that our customers will continue to gradually shorten their order lead times as supply chain disruptions ease further in the near future. Inflationary Pressures The COVID-19 pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for raw materials and components as well as increases in the costs of labor. We continue to experience higher than normal inflation of raw materials and components prices and labor costs. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity cost reduction initiatives, as well as increasing our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers. However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Additionally, the inflationary pressures have given rise to significant increases in interest rates as various governments used monetary policy to reduce inflation. As a result, our weighted average interest rate increased from approximately 2.7% as of September 30, 2022 to approximately 6.1% as of September 29, 2023. Geopolitical Conflicts In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the U.S., the European Union (“EU”), and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the U.S., the EU, and several other countries. Our historical sales to Russia were not material. We also do not have any assets, employees or third-party contractors in Russia or Ukraine. However, the duration of the conflict and further sanctions could have further impact on the global economy and inflation. Due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, the impacts of these longer-term factors to our business are unknown. In early October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas after the Palestinian militant group launched a surprise cross-boarder raid in Israel. We are monitoring the social, political and economic environment in Israel and in the region for any impact on our businesses. Our historical sales to Israel were around 1% of our total sales. We do not have any assets, employees, or third-party contractors in Israel. Due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, future impacts are unknown to our businesses. Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 29, 2023 Compared with the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Overview of Financial Results Total revenue of $221.5 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023 decreased $1.5 million, or 0.7%, from the prior year period primarily due to decreased demand in the advanced industrial markets, partially offset by increased demand in the medical markets and revenue from a prior year acquisition.

SG&A expenses were $122.8 million, or 18.3% of revenue, during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus $120.2 million, or 18.7% of revenue, during the prior year period. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to increases in compensation related expenses and discretionary spending. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding amortization of developed technologies which is included in cost of revenue, was $5.1 million, or 2.3% of revenue, during the three months ended September 29, 2023, versus $6.5 million, or 2.9% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2022. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding amortization of developed technologies which is included in cost of revenue, was $15.3 million, or 2.3% of revenue, during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus $21.0 million, or 3.3% of 33 revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2022. Restructuring, Acquisition, and Related Costs We recorded restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $4.5 million during the three months ended September 29, 2023, versus $1.6 million during the prior year period. During the three months ended September 29, 2023, the restructuring costs increased $2.6 million primarily related to impairment of assets and an increase in severance and related costs. We recorded restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $8.2 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus $2.7 million during the prior year period. The restructuring costs increased $4.9 million primarily related to an increase in severance and related costs.

Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment operating income was $54.8 million, or 25.5% of revenue, during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus $45.8 million, or 22.5% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $12.8 million, partially offset by an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $3.0 million and an increase in SG&A expenses of $1.0 million. Medical Solutions Medical Solutions segment operating income was $11.0 million, or 13.3% of revenue, during the three months ended September 29, 2023, versus $8.7 million, or 11.9% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $5.8 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses of $2.1 million and an increase in SG&A expenses of $1.5 million. Medical Solutions segment operating income was $31.0 million, or 12.7% of revenue, during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus $20.8 million, or 10.4% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $20.2 million and a decrease in amortization expense of $0.8 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses of $6.4 million and an increase in SG&A expenses of $4.3 million. Robotics and Automation Robotics and Automation segment operating income was $12.2 million, or 18.3% of revenue, during the three months ended September 29, 2023, versus $15.8 million, or 20.0% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $4.2 million and an increase restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $2.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in R&D expenses of $1.1 million and a decrease in amortization expense of $1.1 million due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2022. 34 Robotics and Automation segment operating income was $39.5 million, or 18.7% of revenue, during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus $48.2 million, or 20.2% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $13.5 million and an increase of restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $2.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense of $4.7 million due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2022, a decrease in R&D expenses of $1.5 million and a decrease in SG&A expenses of $0.9 million. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition costs. These costs for the three months ended September 29, 2023 decreased $2.8 million versus the prior year period. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to disciplined cost control and lower variable compensation costs. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 decreased $2.2 million versus the prior year period. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to disciplined cost control and lower variable compensation costs. Other Income and Expense Items The following table sets forth other income and expense items for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 29, September 30, September 29, September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Interest income (expense), net $ (6,756 ) $ (4,062 ) $ (19,898 ) $ (9,928 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net (370 ) 2,086 (373 ) 2,307 Other income (expense), net (189 ) 87 (546 ) (390 ) Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $6.8 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023, versus $4.1 million for the prior year period. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 6.68% during the three months ended September 29, 2023, versus 3.37% during the prior year period. Net interest expense was $19.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus $9.9 million for the prior year period. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 6.12% during the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus 2.72% during the prior year period. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $(0.4) million net loss for the three months ended September 29, 2023, versus $2.1 million net gain in the prior year period. The prior period net gain was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Euro. Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $(0.4) million net loss for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus $2.3 million net gain in the prior year period. The prior period net gain was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Euro. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal for both the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 29, 2023 was 7.7%, versus 16.0% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 7.7% for the three months ended September 29, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% 35 primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and tax benefits of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. Our effective tax rate of 16.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, was 11.2%, versus 13.8% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 11.2% for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and tax benefits of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. For the nine months ended September 29, 2023, the tax benefits of stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 4.5% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of 13.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits and tax benefits of share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the tax benefits of stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 0.2% on our effective tax rate. On December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the Pillar Two Model Rules developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) with an effective date of January 2024. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. These rules will impose a global corporate minimum income tax rate of 15%. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on these rules. The Company is analyzing the potential impact and will continue to monitor the related developments. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $350.0 million by exercising the accordion option under our revolving credit agreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of global pandemics and geopolitical conflicts, monetary policy changes in the U.S. and other countries and their impact on the global financial markets, supply chain disruptions and electronics and other material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and other market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Our cash requirements primarily consist of principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below), operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, and pension obligations. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Through September 29, 2023, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2022. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the operating income and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, as local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict 36 certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us, there is no assurance that our subsidiaries will be permitted to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of September 29, 2023, $49.9 million of our $76.0 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. Approximately $124.6 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, originally consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities had an original maturity date of December 2024 and included an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $200 million to $350 million. As of September 29, 2023, we had $77.2 million term loan and $279.4 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Term SOFR Loans, Alternative Currency Loans, and Letters of Credit Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75% and 1.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.30% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of September 29, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $124.6 million and $232.0 million, respectively. The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of September 29, 2023: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.50 1.68 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 5.03 37 Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $50.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the nine months ended September 29, 2023. As of September 29, 2023, we had $49.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 29, September 30, 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 81,083 $ 50,167 Net cash used in investing activities $ (13,741 ) $ (38,283 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (92,783 ) $ (36,669 ) September 29, December 31, 2023 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 75,961 $ 100,105 Unused and available funds under the revolving credit facility $ 415,577 $ 336,587 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $81.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, versus $50.2 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 increased from the prior year period primarily as a result of less cash outflows from changes in net working capital, partially offset by higher income tax payments, higher interest payments, and higher incentive compensation payments. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $13.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, all related to capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $38.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by the $22.4 million of cash consideration (net of cash acquired) paid for the acquisition of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O.(“MPH”). We also paid for capital expenditures of $15.4 million and contingent consideration of $1.5 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $22 million to $24 million in 2023 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses, which includes a significant one-time buildout project in the U.K. for our Solid State and Ultrafast Lasers products. 38 Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $92.8 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023, primarily due to $82.0 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments and $10.1 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards. Cash used in financing activities was $36.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to $46.3 million of contingent consideration payments related to prior year acquisitions, $37.8 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments, $10.0 million of repurchases of common stock, $9.6 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, and $2.5 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Fifth Amendment, partially offset by $69.9 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the contingent consideration paid for the acquisition of ATI Industrial Automation Inc. and cash consideration paid for the MPH acquisition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through September 29, 2023 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3. Quant itative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity. During the three months ended September 29, 2023, there have been no material changes to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. I tem 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 29, 2023, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 29, 2023. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 39 P ART II—OTHER INFORMATION I tem 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. I tem 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. The risk factors set forth below update, and should be read together with, the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses, capital expenditures and levels of business activities. A large portion of our product sales are dependent on our customers’ need for increased capacity, productivity and cost saving initiatives, improved product quality and performance, and new investments. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A severe and/or prolonged overall economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could lead to weaknesses in our end markets and adversely affect our customers’ financial condition and the timing or levels of our customers’ capital expenditures or business activities. We have experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations in the past. For example, diminished growth expectations, economic and political uncertainty in regions across the globe and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our customers’ financial condition and ability to maintain product order levels and reduced the demand for our products in 2020. In addition, certain sub-segments of the advanced industrial market that we serve, including the microelectronics and industrial capital equipment sectors, are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment in which many of our products are used. It is difficult to predict the timing, length and severity of these downturns and their impact on our business. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market demand for our products. We have also faced increases in inflationary conditions in materials and components as well as labor costs, and we expect these inflationary conditions to continue at least for the remainder of 2023. These inflationary conditions have caused us to increase prices; however, such price increases may not be accepted by our customers or may not adequately offset the increases in our costs, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions, including inflationary conditions, could also shift market demand to products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages. This could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changes in economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected. Adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or other third parties, or concerns or rumors about these events, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Uncertainty may remain over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, and there may be unpredictable impacts to our business and our industry. I tem 2.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. (“Novanta” or the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in precision medicine and manufacturing, medical solutions, and robotics and automation with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company changed the names of its reportable segments from “Photonics” to “Precision Medicine and Manufacturing”, from “Vision” to “Medical Solutions”, and from “Precision Motion” to “Robotics and Automation”, respectively. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the compositions of the Company's segments and therefore did not result in any change to historical results. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements None 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time. As the Company’s right to payment from a customer is based on the value of engineering services performed, the Company recognizes revenue based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Revenue from engineering services aggregated to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The standard warranty periods for the Company’s products are typically 12 months to 36 months . The Company recognizes estimated liabilities associated with standard warranty periods for its products in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liabilities and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liabilities. A provision for the estimated cost related to standard warranties is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of the costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities are recorded at that time, with offsetting adjustments to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the expected amortization period is typically one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, contract liabilities were $ 6.6 million and $ 8.4 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the six months ended June 30, 2023 is primarily due to $ 5.3 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2022, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 15 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 7 NOVANTA INC.

Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. The dilutive effects of outstanding common share equivalents, including outstanding service-based restricted stock units, stock options and performance-based restricted stock units, are determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. The dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets only when the performance targets have been achieved as of the end of the reporting period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, July 1, June 30, July 1, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 20,879 $ 17,479 $ 39,144 $ 36,299 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,851 35,609 35,830 35,573 Dilutive potential common shares 181 324 185 284 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 36,032 35,933 36,015 35,857 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 141 146 127 120 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.58 $ 0.49 $ 1.09 $ 1.02 Diluted $ 0.58 $ 0.49 $ 1.09 $ 1.01 For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, 148 thousand shares of performance-based restricted stock units were considered attainment-based contingently issuable shares that were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the performance targets had not been achieved as of June 30, 2023. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) For both the three and six months ended July 1, 2022, 125 thousand shares of performance-based restricted stock units were considered attainment-based contingently issuable shares that were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the performance targets had not been achieved as of July 1, 2022 . 5. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES ”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). During 2021, the Company made the first installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2021 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 3.3 million ($ 3.8 million) as of December 31, 2021. During 2022, the Company made the second installment payment of € 0.3 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2022 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million). The installment payments have been reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections as of June 30, 2023, the Company did no t make any adjustments to the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 9 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) 6. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures and are included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of June 30, 2023, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 142.4 million and a net gain of $ 0.1 million, respective ly. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 117.1 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively.

The Company recognized an aggregate net loss of $ 1.4 million and $ 1.5 million for the three and six months ended July 1, 2022, respectively . 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist.

The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through March 2027 . The Company made principal payments of € 2.3 million ($ 2.4 million) towards its term loan and $ 28.1 million towards its revolving credit facility during the six months ended June 30, 2023. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 200.0 million, from $ 495.0 million to $ 695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $ 200 million to $ 350 million. In connection with the Fifth Amendment, the Company capitalized $ 2.5 million deferred financing costs and recorded a $ 0.6 million loss from the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2023.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Fair Value of Debt As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 10. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2023 and 2036 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to ten years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewal options to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms.

Preferred and Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Preferred Shares In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares, fix the rights, preferences and designation, as deemed necessary or advisable, relating to the preferred shares, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share . As of June 30, 2023 , no preferred shares had been issued and outstanding. Common Share Repurchases In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of $ 50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the six months ended July 1, 2022, the Company repurchased 4 thousand shares under the 2020 Repurchase Plan for an aggregate purchase price of $ 0.5 million and an average price of $ 116.95 per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of June 30, 2023 , the Company had $ 49.5 million available for future share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, July 1, June 30, July 1, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Selling, general and administrative $ 4,871 $ 4,056 $ 10,402 $ 9,257 Research and development and engineering 542 494 985 1,194 Cost of revenue 462 531 954 1,404 Total share-based compensation expense $ 5,875 $ 5,081 $ 12,341 $ 11,855 Share-based compensation expense reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 0.9 million and $ 1.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022, respectively. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis 17 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. Outstanding DSUs are converted into common shares upon Board members' resignation or retirement from the Board. There were 41 thousand and 38 thousand DSUs outstanding as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Outstanding DSUs are included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended June 30, 2023: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2022 238 $ 128.26 Granted 87 $ 155.65 Vested ( 97 ) $ 120.96 Forfeited ( 17 ) $ 138.06 Unvested at June 30, 2023 211 $ 142.37 Expected to vest as of June 30, 2023 190 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $ 15.1 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants performance-based restricted stock unit awards (“PSUs”) that are based on the Company's financial metrics, market conditions, or a hybrid of financial metrics and market conditions. These performance stock unit awards generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the specified performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the Company's financial metrics attainment-based PSUs (“attainment-based PSUs”) is determined based on the Company’s financial metrics over the specified performance period against the targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the specified performance period. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the market condition-based PSUs (“market-based PSUs”) is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the specified performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the market-based PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the specified performance period. Compensation expense on market-based PSUs will not be affected by the number of shares that will ultimately vest at the end of the specified performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the PSU awards that are based on achievement of a hybrid of financial metrics and market conditions (“Hybrid PSUs”) is determined based on the Company's financial metrics achieved over the specified performance period against the targets established by the Company's Board of Directors at the time of grant with a market condition multiplier and will be in the range of zero to 260 % of the target number of shares. The Company determines the fair value of these Hybrid PSUs using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the Hybrid PSUs ratably over the performance period based on the fair value of the PSUs as of the grant date and the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the specified performance 18 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) period. The probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended June 30, 2023: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2022 216 $ 144.16 Granted 57 $ 179.15 Performance adjustments (1) 20 $ 122.24 Vested ( 70 ) $ 116.56 Forfeited ( 12 ) $ 166.77 Unvested at June 30, 2023 211 $ 160.70 Expected to vest as of June 30, 2023 251 (1) The amount shown represents performance adjustments related to the performance-based awards granted on February 20, 2020. These units vested at a blended payout of 142 % during the six months ended June 30, 2023 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions, respectively, over the performance period of fiscal years 2020 through 2022. The unvested PSUs are shown at target payout levels in the table above. As of June 30, 2023 , the maximum number of common shares that could be earned under these PSU grants was approximately 374 thousand shares. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $ 9.9 million based on the market price of the underlying common shares on the date of vesting. The grant-date fair value of the Hybrid PSUs granted during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method with the following assumptions: Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Grant-date stock price $ 156.72 Expected volatility 35.89 % Risk-free interest rate 4.44 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 181.45 Stock Options In February 2023, the Company granted 48 thousand nonqualified stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a strike price equal to the closing market price on the date of grant. The stock options vest ratably over three years on the anniversary of the date of grant and expire on the seven th anniversary of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in the consolidated statement of operations. 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes the activities relating to stock options issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended June 30, 2023: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 84 $ 72.18 Granted 48 $ 135.86 Exercised — $ — Forfeited or expired — $ — Outstanding as of June 30, 2023 132 $ 102.86 Exercisable as of June 30, 2023 57 Expected to vest as of June 30, 2023 75 The aggregate Black-Scholes fair value of $ 3.0 million for the stock options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was estimated using the following assumptions as of the grant date: Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Expected option term in years 4.5 Expected volatility 40.7 % Risk-free interest rate 4.00 % Expected annual dividend yield — The expected option term was calculated using the simplified method permitted under Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins Topic 14, “Share-Based Payment”. The expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common shares over the expected option term. The risk-free interest rate was based on treasury instrument whose term was six months longer than the expected option term. The expected annual dividend yield is zero as the Company does not have plans to issue dividends. 12. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the period in which the changes are determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses, credits and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are not more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of adding a new or additional valuation allowance or releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. The Company’s effective tax rate of 17.4 % for the three months ended June 30, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and R&D tax credits, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals . 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) The Company’s effective tax rate of 13.0 % for the six months ended June 30, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 4.0 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of 15.8 % for the three months ended July 1, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, and R&D tax credits, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. The Company’s effective tax rate of 12.4 % for the six months ended July 1, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period, partially offset by disallowed compensation deductions and uncertain tax position accruals. For the six months ended July 1, 2022, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 1.4 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. 13.

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2022. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to 22 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2023 (Unaudited) whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is considered reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the potential loss or a range of potential losses, if such an estimate can be reasonably made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of outstanding claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products, and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director or officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding by reason of their relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors and officers liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 15. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes certain financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit.

The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the medical market accounted for approximately 53% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in 27 technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 47% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by several factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial conditions of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the PMI on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: Significant Events and Updates Business Environment Global Supply Chain Disruptions Over the past three years, we experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers could further challenge our ability to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of supply chain interruptions, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising quality and performance, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays for obtaining raw materials from suppliers. Our supply chain disruptions and customer orders to secure supply caused 28 significantly elevated customer order backlog levels in the last two years. While our backlog coverage level remains comparable to year-end 2022, we anticipate that our customers will gradually shorten their order lead times as supply chain disruptions ease over time in the near future. Inflationary Pressures The COVID-19 pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for raw materials and components as well as increases in the costs of labor. We continue to experience higher than normal inflation of raw materials and components prices and labor costs. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity cost reduction initiatives, as well as increasing our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers. However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Additionally, the inflationary pressures have given rise to significant increases in interest rates as various governments used monetary policy to reduce inflation. As a result, our weighted average interest rate increased from approximately 2.4% as of July 1, 2022 to approximately 5.8% as of June 30, 2023. Russia Ukraine Conflict In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the U.S., the European Union (“EU”), and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the U.S., the EU, and several other countries. Our historical sales to Russia were not material. We also do not have any assets, employees or third-party contractors in Russia or Ukraine. However, the duration of the conflict and further sanctions could have further impact on the global economy and inflation. Due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, these longer-term factors are unknown to our business.

The OECD continues to release additional guidance on these rules. The Company is analyzing the potential impact and will continue to monitor the related developments. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $350.0 million by exercising the accordion option under our revolving credit agreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of global pandemics and geo-political conflicts, monetary policy changes in the U.S. and other countries and their impact on the global financial markets, supply chain disruptions and electronics and other material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and other market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Our cash requirements primarily consist of principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below), operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, and pension obligations. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Through June 30, 2023, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2022. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the operating income and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, as local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us, there is no assurance that our subsidiaries will be permitted to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of June 30, 2023, $51.2 million of our $91.3 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. Approximately $135.8 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. 35 Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, originally consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities had an original maturity date of December 2024 and included an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $200 million to $350 million. As of June 30, 2023, we had $81.2 million term loan and $331.6 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Term SOFR Loans, Alternative Currency Loans, and Letters of Credit Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75% and 1.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.30% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of June 30, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $135.8 million and $277.0 million, respectively. The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of June 30, 2023: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.50 2.00 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 5.63 Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $50.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to 36 Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the six months ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, we had $49.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, July 1, 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 36,442 $ 35,408 Net cash used in investing activities $ (6,946 ) $ (12,616 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (40,819 ) $ (35,473 ) June 30, December 31, 2023 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 91,330 $ 100,105 Unused and available funds under the revolving credit facility $ 363,415 $ 336,587 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $36.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, versus $35.4 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 increased from the prior year period primarily due to higher operating income and less cash outflow from net working capital, partially offset by higher income tax payment, higher interest payments, and higher incentive compensation payments. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $6.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, all related to capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $12.6 million for the six months ended July 1, 2022, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $12.1 million and a contingent consideration payment of $1.5 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $25 million to $30 million in 2023 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses, which includes a significant one-time buildout project in the U.K. for our Solid State and Ultrafast Lasers products. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $40.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to $30.5 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments and $10.0 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards. Cash used in financing activities was $35.5 million for the six months ended July 1, 2022, primarily due to $10 million of repurchases of common stock, $9.5 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $12.8 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments, and $2.5 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Fifth Amendment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through June 30, 2023 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. 37 Recent Accounting Pronouncements None. Item 3. Quant itative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, there have been no material changes to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. I tem 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2023, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2023. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 38 P ART II—OTHER INFORMATION I tem 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. I tem 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. The risk factors set forth below update, and should be read together with, the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses, capital expenditures and levels of business activities. A large portion of our product sales are dependent on our customers’ need for increased capacity, productivity and cost saving initiatives, improved product quality and performance, and new investments. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A severe and/or prolonged overall economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could lead to weaknesses in our end markets and adversely affect our customers’ financial condition and the timing or levels of our customers’ capital expenditures or business activities. We have experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations in the past. For example, diminished growth expectations, economic and political uncertainty in regions across the globe and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our customers’ financial condition and ability to maintain product order levels and reduced the demand for our products in 2020. In addition, certain sub-segments of the advanced industrial market that we serve, including the microelectronics and industrial capital equipment sectors, are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment in which many of our products are used. It is difficult to predict the timing, length and severity of these downturns and their impact on our business. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market demand for our products. We have also faced increases in inflationary conditions in materials and components as well as labor costs, and we expect these inflationary conditions to continue at least for the remainder of 2023. These inflationary conditions have caused us to increase prices; however, such price increases may not be accepted by our customers or may not adequately offset the increases in our costs, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions, including inflationary conditions, could also shift market demand to products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages. This could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changes in economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected. Adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or other third parties, or concerns or rumors about these events, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Uncertainty may remain over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, and there may be unpredictable impacts to our business and our industry. I tem 2.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. (“Novanta” or the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in precision medicine and manufacturing, medical solutions, and robotics and automation with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company changed the names of its reportable segments from “Photonics” to “Precision Medicine and Manufacturing”, from “Vision” to “Medical Solutions”, and from “Precision Motion” to “Robotics and Automation”, respectively. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the compositions of the Company's segments and therefore did not result in any change to historical results. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements None 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time. As the Company’s right to payment from a customer is based on the value of engineering services performed, the Company recognizes revenue based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Revenue from engineering services aggregated to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The standard warranty periods for the Company’s products are typically 12 months to 36 months . The Company recognizes estimated liabilities associated with standard warranty periods for its products in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liabilities and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liabilities. A provision for the estimated cost related to standard warranties is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of the costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities are recorded at that time, with offsetting adjustments to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the expected amortization period is typically one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, contract liabilities were $ 7.2 million and $ 8.4 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the three months ended March 31, 2023 is primarily due to $ 4.1 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2022, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 15 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 7 NOVANTA INC.

Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. The dilutive effects of outstanding common share equivalents, including outstanding service-based restricted stock units, stock options and performance-based restricted stock units, are determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. The dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation only when the performance targets have been achieved based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets as of the end of the reporting period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended March 31, April 1, 2023 2022 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 18,265 $ 18,820 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,810 35,538 Dilutive potential common shares 189 243 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,999 35,781 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 113 93 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.51 $ 0.53 Diluted $ 0.51 $ 0.53 For the three months ended March 31, 2023, 151 thousand shares of performance based restricted stock units were considered attainment-based contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of March 31, 2023. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) For the three months ended April 1, 2022 , 128 thousand shares of performance based restricted stock units and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders were considered attainment-based contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of April 1, 2022 . 5. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES ”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). During 2021, the Company made the first installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2021 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 3.3 million ($ 3.8 million) as of December 31, 2021. During 2022, the Company made the second installment payment of € 0.3 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2022 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million). The installment payments have been reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections as of March 31, 2023, the Company did no t make any adjustments to the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration during the three months ended March 31, 2023. 9 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) 6. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of March 31, 2023, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 122.5 million and a net gain of $ 0.1 million, respective ly. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 117.1 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net gain of $ 0.6 million and an aggregate net loss of $ 0.1 million for th e three months ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022 and noted no impairment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Senior Credit Facilities On December 31, 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) with existing lenders for an aggregate credit facility of $ 450.0 million, consisting of a $ 100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately € 90.2 million) 5 -year term loan facility and a $ 350.0 million 5 -year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). As amended, the Senior Credit Facilities mature in March 2027 and include an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 350.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through March 2027 . The Company made principal payments of € 1.1 million ($ 1.2 million) towards its term loan and $ 14.1 million towards its revolving credit facility during the three months ended March 31, 2023. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 200.0 million, from $ 495.0 million to $ 695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $ 200 million to $ 350 million. In connection with the Fifth Amendment, the Company capitalized $ 2.5 million deferred financing costs and recorded a $ 0.6 million loss from the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of March 31, 2023. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. Fair Value of Debt As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 10. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2023 and 2036 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewal options to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms. 14 NOVANTA INC.

Preferred and Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Preferred Shares In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares, fix the rights, preferences and designation, as deemed necessary or advisable, relating to the preferred shares, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share . As of March 31, 2023 , no preferred shares had been issued and outstanding. Common Share Repurchases In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of $ 50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the three months ended July 1, 2022, the Company repurchased 4 thousand shares under the 2020 Repurchase Plan for an aggregate purchase price of $ 0.5 million and an average price of $ 116.95 per share. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had $ 49.5 million available for future share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, April 1, 2023 2022 Selling, general and administrative $ 5,531 $ 5,201 Research and development and engineering 443 700 Cost of revenue 492 873 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs — — Total share-based compensation expense $ 6,466 $ 6,774 Share-based compensation expense reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 0.9 million and $ 1.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis 16 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. Outstanding DSUs are converted into common shares upon Board members' resignation or retirement from the Board. There were 41 thousand and 38 thousand DSUs outstanding as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Outstanding DSUs are included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended March 31, 2023: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2022 238 $ 128.26 Granted 81 $ 155.12 Vested ( 89 ) $ 121.47 Forfeited ( 9 ) $ 132.87 Unvested at March 31, 2023 221 $ 140.82 Expected to vest as of March 31, 2023 196 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $ 13.8 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants performance-based restricted stock unit awards (“PSUs”) that are based on the Company's financial metrics, market conditions, or a hybrid of financial metrics and market conditions. These performance stock unit awards generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the specified performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the Company's financial metrics attainment-based PSUs (“attainment-based PSUs”) is determined based on the Company’s financial metrics over the specified performance period against the targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the specified performance period. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the market condition-based PSUs (“market-based PSUs”) is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the specified performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the market-based PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the specified performance period. Compensation expense on market-based PSUs will not be affected by the number of shares that will ultimately vest at the end of the specified performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the PSU awards that are based on achievement of a hybrid of financial metrics and market conditions (“Hybrid PSUs”) is determined based on the Company's financial metrics achieved over the specified performance period against the targets established by the Company's Board of Directors at the time of grant with a market condition multiplier and will be in the range of zero to 260 % of the target number of shares. The Company determines the fair value of the market condition multiplier using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the Hybrid PSUs ratably over the specified performance period based on the fair value of the PSUs as of the grant date and the number of shares expected to be earned. The probability assessment is 17 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended March 31, 2023: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2022 216 $ 144.16 Granted 57 $ 179.15 Performance adjustments (1) 20 $ 122.24 Vested ( 70 ) $ 116.56 Forfeited ( 7 ) $ 167.06 Unvested at March 31, 2023 216 $ 160.81 Expected to vest as of March 31, 2023 241 (1) The amount shown represents performance adjustments related to the performance-based awards granted on February 20, 2020. These units vested at a blended payout of 142 % during the three months ended March 31, 2023 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions, respectively, over the performance period of fiscal years 2020 through 2022. The unvested PSUs are shown at target payout levels in the table above. As of March 31, 2023 , the maximum number of common shares that could be earned under these PSU grants was approximately 381 thousand shares. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $ 9.9 million based on the market price of the underlying common shares on the date of vesting. The grant-date fair value of the Hybrid PSUs granted during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method with the following assumptions: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Grant-date stock price $ 156.72 Expected volatility 35.89 % Risk-free interest rate 4.44 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 181.45 Stock Options In February 2023, the Company granted 48 thousand nonqualified stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a strike price equal to the closing market price on the date of grant. The stock options vest ratably over three years on the anniversary of the date of grant and expire on the seven th anniversary of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in the consolidated statement of operations. 18 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes the activities relating to stock options issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended March 31, 2023: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 84 $ 72.18 Granted 48 $ 135.86 Exercised — $ — Forfeited or expired — $ — Outstanding as of March 31, 2023 132 $ 102.86 Exercisable as of March 31, 2023 57 Expected to vest as of March 31, 2023 75 The aggregate Black-Scholes fair value of $ 3.0 million for the stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was estimated using the following assumptions as of the grant date: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Expected option term in years 4.5 Expected volatility 40.7 % Risk-free interest rate 4.00 % Expected annual dividend yield — The expected option term was calculated using the simplified method permitted under Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins Topic 14, “Share-Based Payment”. The expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common shares over the expected option term. The risk-free interest rate was based on treasury instrument whose term was six months longer than the expected option term. The expected annual dividend yield is zero as the Company does not have plans to issue dividends. 12. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the period in which the changes are determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses, credits and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are not more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of adding a new or additional valuation allowance or releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. The Company’s effective tax rate of 7.5 % for the three months ended March 31, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 8.2 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) The Company’s effective tax rate of 9.1 % for the three months ended April 1, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. For the three months ended April 1, 2022, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 3 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. 13. Restructuring, Acquisition, and Related Costs The following table summarizes restructuring, acquisition, and related costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, April 1, 2023 2022 2022 restructuring $ 2,197 $ — 2020 restructuring 274 622 Total restructuring charges 2,471 622 Acquisition and related charges 5 ( 2,252 ) Total restructuring, acquisition, and related costs $ 2,476 $ ( 1,630 ) 2022 Restructuring As a result of the Company’s ongoing evaluations and efforts to reduce its operating costs, while improving efficiency and effectiveness, the Company initiated the 2022 restructuring program in the third quarter of 2022.

During the three months ended April 1, 2022 , the Company recognized $ 2.3 million reduction in the fair value of certain prior-year acquisition contingent considerations. The majority of acquisition and related costs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were included in the Company’s Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services reportable segment. The majority of acquisition and related costs for the three months ended April 1, 2022 were included in the Company’s Precision Medicine and Manufacturing and Robotics and Automation reportable segments. 14. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2022. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is considered reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the potential loss or a range of potential losses, if such an estimate can be reasonably made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 21 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2023 (Unaudited) Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products, and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director or officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding by reason of their relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors and officers liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 15. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product is impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers. Based upon the information provided to the CODM, the Company has determined that it operates in three reportable segments: Precision Medicine and Manufacturing, Medical Solutions, and Robotics and Automation. The reportable segments and their principal activities are described below.

(the “Company”, “Novanta”, “we”, “us”, “our”) are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, except for the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Business Overview We are a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in precision medicine and manufacturing, medical solutions, and robotics and automation with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. During the first quarter of 2023, we changed the names of our reportable segments from “Photonics” to “Precision Medicine and Manufacturing”, from “Vision” to “Medical Solutions”, and from “Precision Motion” to “Robotics and Automation”, respectively. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the compositions of our segments and therefore did not result in any change to historical results. Reportable Segments We operate in three reportable segments: Precision Medicine and Manufacturing, Medical Solutions, and Robotics and Automation. The reportable segments and their principal activities are summarized below. Precision Medicine and Manufacturing Our Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures, particularly ophthalmology applications. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Medical Solutions Our Medical Solutions segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless technologies, video recorder and video integration technologies for operating room integrations; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies; and embedded touch screen solutions. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Robotics and Automation Our Robotics and Automation segment designs, manufactures and markets optical and inductive encoders, precision motors, servo drives and motion control solutions, integrated stepper motors, intelligent robotic end-of-arm technology solutions, air bearings, and air bearing spindles to customers worldwide. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the medical market accounted for approximately 54% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes 26 in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 46% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by several factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial conditions of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the PMI on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: Significant Events and Updates Business Environment Global Supply Chain Disruptions Over the past three years, we experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers could further challenge our ability to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of supply chain interruptions, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising quality and performance, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays for obtaining raw materials from suppliers. Our supply chain disruptions and customer orders to secure supply caused 27 significantly elevated customer order backlog levels in the last two years. As of March 31, 2023, our backlog was almost double our average pre-COVID pandemic backlog levels due to longer customer lead times. We anticipate that our customers will gradually shorten their order lead times as supply chain disruptions ease over time in the near future. Inflationary Pressures The COVID-19 pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for raw materials and components as well increases in the costs of labor. We continue to experience higher than normal inflation of raw materials and components prices as well as labor costs. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity cost reduction initiatives, as well as increasing our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers. However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Additionally, the inflationary pressures have given rise to significant increases in interest rates as various governments used monetary policy to reduce inflation. As a result, our weighted average interest rate increased from approximately 2.5% as of April 1, 2022 to approximately 5.6% as of March 31, 2023. Russia Ukraine Conflict In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the U.S., the European Union (“EU”), and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the U.S., the EU, and several other countries. Our sales to Russia have not been material. We also do not have any assets, employees or third-party contractors in Russia or Ukraine. The duration of the conflict and further sanctions could have further impact on the global economy and inflation. Due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, these longer-term factors are unknown to our business. Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared with the Three Months Ended April 1, 2022 Overview of Financial Results Total revenue of $219.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $14.9 million, or 7.3%, from the prior year period primarily due to increased demand in the advanced industrial and medical markets and revenue from a prior year acquisition. The effect of our prior year acquisition resulted in an increase in revenue of $3.5 million, or 1.7%. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by $5.8 million, or 2.8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Operating income of $26.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $2.0 million, or 8.4%, from the prior year period. This increase was attributable to an increase in gross profit of $7.4 million primarily attributable to higher revenue, an increase in gross profit margin, and a decrease in amortization expense of $2.3 million, partially offset by an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $4.1 million, an increase in research and development and engineering expenses of $1.9 million, and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.6 million. Basic earnings per common share (“Basic EPS”) of $0.51 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased $0.02 from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per common share (“Diluted EPS”) of $0.51 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased $0.02 from the prior year period. The decreases were primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in operating income.

Robotics and Automation segment gross profit margin was 45.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus a gross profit margin of 48.1% for the prior year 29 period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to inefficient factory utilization due to a decrease in demand in the microelectronics market. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments. These costs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased by $0.1 million versus the prior year period. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expenses for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, April 1, 2023 2022 Research and development and engineering $ 22,828 $ 20,929 Selling, general and administrative 40,923 39,352 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 5,089 7,342 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs 2,476 (1,630 ) Total $ 71,316 $ 65,993 Research and Development and Engineering Expenses Research and Development and Engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. R&D expenses were $22.8 million, or 10.4% of revenue, during the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus $20.9 million, or 10.2% of revenue, during the prior year period. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, primarily due to higher compensation related expenses as a result of higher headcount. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems, and executive management functions. SG&A expenses were $40.9 million, or 18.7% of revenue, during the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus $39.4 million, or 19.3% of revenue, during the prior year period. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to increases in compensation related expenses and discretionary spending. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $5.1 million, or 2.3% of revenue, during the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus $7.3 million, or 3.6% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was primarily due to certain intangibles being fully amortized in 2022. Restructuring, Acquisition, and Related Costs We recorded restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $2.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus $(1.6) million during the prior year period. During the three months ended April 1, 2022, the Company recognized $2.3 million reduction in the fair value of certain prior-year acquisition contingent consideration. The restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased $1.8 million primarily due to increased expenses related to the 2022 restructuring plan. 30 Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, April 1, 2023 2022 Operating Income (Loss) Precision Medicine and Manufacturing $ 16,684 $ 13,435 Medical Solutions 9,841 5,042 Robotics and Automation 12,000 18,338 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (12,213 ) (12,532 ) Total $ 26,312 $ 24,283 Precision Medicine and Manufacturing Precision Medicine and Manufacturing segment operating income was $16.7 million, or 24.0% of revenue, during the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus $13.4 million, or 21.4% of revenue, during the prior year period.

Robotics and Automation Robotics and Automation segment operating income was $12.0 million, or 16.7% of revenue, during the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus $18.3 million, or 23.1% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $5.3 million, an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $1.9 million, and an increase in SG&A expenses of $1.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense of $1.8 million due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in 2022. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition costs. These costs for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased by $0.3 million versus the prior year period. Other Income and Expense Items The following table sets forth other income and expense items for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, April 1, 2023 2022 Interest income (expense), net $ (6,332 ) $ (3,109 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net $ (77 ) $ 69 Other income (expense), net $ (166 ) $ (545 ) Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $6.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus $3.1 million in the prior year period. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 5.55% during the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus 2.49% during the prior year period. 31 Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were nominal for both the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the three months ended April 1, 2022. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal for both the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the three months ended April 1, 2022. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 7.5%, versus 9.1% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 7.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 8.2% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of 9.1% for the three months ended April 1, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. For the three months ended April 1, 2022, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 3% on our effective tax rate. On December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Pillar Two Model Rules to be effective as of January 2024. These rules will impose a global corporate minimum income tax rate of 15%. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on these rules. The Company is analyzing the potential impact and will continue to monitor the related developments. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $350.0 million by exercising the accordion option under our revolving credit agreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of global pandemics and geo-political conflicts, monetary policy changes in the U.S. and other countries and their impact on the global financial markets, supply chain disruptions and electronics and other material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and other market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Our cash requirements primarily consist of principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below), operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, and pension obligations. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Through March 31, 2023, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2022. 32 Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the operating income and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, as local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us, there is no assurance that our subsidiaries will be permitted to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of March 31, 2023, $56.0 million of our $82.7 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. Approximately $143.0 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, originally consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities had an original maturity date of December 2024 and included an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $200 million to $350 million. As of March 31, 2023, we had $82.4 million term loan and $345.6 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Term SOFR Loans, Alternative Currency Loans, and Letters of Credit Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75% and 1.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.30% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of March 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $143.0 million and $285.0 million, respectively. The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of March 31, 2023: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.50 2.14 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 6.74 33 Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, we had $49.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 and April 1, 2022 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31, April 1, 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,245 $ 11,347 Net cash used in investing activities $ (3,620 ) $ (6,821 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (25,066 ) $ (22,029 ) March 31, December 31, 2023 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 82,676 $ 100,105 Unused and available funds under the revolving credit facility $ 349,410 $ 336,587 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus $11.3 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to higher incentive compensation payments, partially offset by better net working capital performance versus the prior year period. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, all related to capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $6.8 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $6.3 million and a contingent consideration payment of $1.5 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $25 million to $30 million in 2023 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses, which includes a significant one-time buildout project in the U.K. for our Solid State and Ultrafast Lasers products. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $25.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to $15.3 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments and $9.6 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards. 34 Cash used in financing activities was $22.0 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022, primarily due to $11.6 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments, $7.7 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, and $2.1 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Fifth Amendment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through March 31, 2023 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Recent Accounting Pronouncements None. Item 3. Quant itative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, there have been no material changes to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. I tem 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2023, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2023. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 35 P ART II—OTHER INFORMATION I tem 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. I tem 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. The risk factors set forth below update, and should be read together with, the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses, capital expenditures and levels of business activities. A large portion of our product sales are dependent on our customers’ need for increased capacity, productivity and cost saving initiatives, improved product quality and performance, and new investments. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A severe and/or prolonged overall economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could lead to weaknesses in our end markets and adversely affect our customers’ financial condition and the timing or levels of our customers’ capital expenditures or business activities. We have experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations in the past. For example, diminished growth expectations, economic and political uncertainty in regions across the globe and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our customers’ financial condition and ability to maintain product order levels and reduced the demand for our products in 2020. In addition, certain sub-segments of the advanced industrial market that we serve, including the microelectronics and industrial capital equipment sectors, are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment in which many of our products are used. It is difficult to predict the timing, length and severity of these downturns and their impact on our business. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market demand for our products. We have also faced increases in inflationary conditions in materials and components as well as labor costs, and we expect these inflationary conditions to continue in 2023. These inflationary conditions have caused us to increase prices; however, such price increases may not be accepted by our customers or may not adequately offset the increases in our costs, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions, including inflationary conditions, could also shift market demand to products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages. This could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changes in economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected. Adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or other third parties, or concerns or rumors about these events, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Uncertainty may remain over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, and there may be unpredictable impacts to our business and our industry. I tem 2.

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. Adoption of ASU 2020-04 is elective. In March 2022, the Company amended the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and replaced LIBOR with SOFR as the new reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings. The ASU did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2021-08 requires that entities recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. ASU 2021-08 also applies to contract assets or liabilities from other contracts to which the provisions of ASC 606 apply. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 do not affect the accounting for other assets or liabilities that may arise from revenue contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606, such as refund liabilities, or in a business combination, such as customer-related intangible assets and contract-based intangible assets. January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 as of January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not have any material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time. As the Company’s right to payment from a customer is based on the value of engineering services performed, the Company recognizes revenue based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Revenue from engineering services aggregated to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The standard warranty periods for the Company’s products are typically 12 months to 36 months . The Company recognizes estimated liabilities associated with standard warranty periods for its products in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liabilities and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liabilities. A provision for the estimated cost related to standard warranties is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of the costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities are recorded at that time, with offsetting adjustments to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the r emaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, contract liabilities were $ 6.9 million and $ 7.3 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 is primarily due to $ 4.4 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2021, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 16 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) 3. Business Combinations On August 11, 2022 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. (""MPH""), a Czech Republic-based manufacturer of medical consumables with plastics specialization in making disposable tub-set-like products, for a total purchase price of € 21.8 million ($ 22.4 million) , net of cash acquired. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The addition of MPH is expected to expand the Company's capacity and capabilities in the medical disposable tube set products within the Vision reportable segment. Allocation of Purchase Price The acquisition of MPH has been accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price is allocated based upon a valuation of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the acquired tangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill for the acquisition. The Company's estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as a result of additional information obtained with regard to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. MPH Based upon preliminary valuation, the total purchase price for MPH was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 182 Accounts receivable 1,658 Inventories 957 Property, plant and equipment 12,094 Goodwill 9,863 Other assets 163 Total assets acquired 24,917 Accounts payable 562 Deferred tax liabilities 1,124 Other liabilities 664 Total liabilities assumed 2,350 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 22,567 Less: cash acquired 182 Purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 22,385 The purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Company is in the process of collecting additional information for the valuation of inventories, property plant and equipment, other liabilities, and unrecognized tax benefits. The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 9.9 million of goodwill. As the MPH acquisition was structured as a stock acquisition, the goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated future benefits from the expansion of the Company's manufacturing capacity and capabilities for the medical disposal tube set products. The operating results of MPH were included in the Company's results of operations beginning on August 12, 2022. MPH contributed revenues of $ 2.1 million and a profit before income taxes of $ 0.2 million to the Company's operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs are included in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs for MPH were $ 0.8 million and $ 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , respectively. 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) 4. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Loss Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2021 $ ( 12,866 ) $ ( 5,753 ) $ ( 7,113 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 36,363 ) ( 37,672 ) 1,309 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 302 — 302 Balance at September 30, 2022 $ ( 48,927 ) $ ( 43,425 ) $ ( 5,502 ) The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 5. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. The dilutive effects of outstanding common share equivalents, including outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”) and other performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), are determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares from the TSR-PSUs are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. The dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares from other PSUs are included in the weighted average common share calculation only when the performance targets have been achieved based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets as of the end of the reporting period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, October 1, September 30, October 1, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 22,490 $ 13,603 $ 58,789 $ 36,577 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,729 35,447 35,625 35,366 Dilutive potential common shares 199 317 256 405 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,928 35,764 35,881 35,771 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 73 1 104 18 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.63 $ 0.38 $ 1.65 $ 1.03 Diluted $ 0.63 $ 0.38 $ 1.64 $ 1.02 For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , 36 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and 37 thousand operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”) granted to certain members of the executive management team, and 51 thousand performance-based restricted stock units granted to ATI Industrial Automation employees (“ATI-PSUs”) are considered attainment-based contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of September 30, 2022. 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) For both the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021 , 45 thousand EPS-PSUs and 37 thousand OCF-PSUs granted to certain members of the executive management team, and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders were considered attainment-based contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of October 1, 2021 . 6. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On August 30, 2021, the Company acquired ATI Industrial Automation Inc. (“ATI”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ATI acquisition, the former shareholders of ATI (the “Sellers”) are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on ATI’s fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement. The contingent consideration would be payable in 2022 after the Sellers and the Company agree on the final amount for the Adjusted EBITDA. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. The fair value of the contingent consideration was $ 44.0 million as of December 31, 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to $ 45.0 million based on the final determination of ATI’s 2021 Adjusted EBITDA. The Company made the contingent consideration payment of $ 45.0 million in August 2022. The estimated fair value of $ 44.0 million included in the determination of the purchase price is reported as a cash outflow from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 while the remaining $ 1.0 million payment is reported as a cash outflow from operating activities. On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES ”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). During 2021, the Company made the first 11 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2021 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 3.3 million ($ 3.8 million) as of December 31, 2021. During 2022, the Company made the second installment payment of € 0.3 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2022. The installment payments are reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections as of September 30, 2022 , the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million). On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million ($ 9.0 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million) in May 2020 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 2.3 million ($ 2.9 million) as of the end of the year. During 2021, the Company made the second installment payment of € 1.2 million ($ 1.4 million) in May 2021 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 1.5 million ($ 1.7 million) as of the end of the year. During the three months ended July 1, 2022, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 1.8 million ($ 1.9 million). The Company made the final installment of € 1.8 million ($ 1.9 million) in July 2022. The installment payments are reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and are amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. Based on revenue achievements against the target through the end of 2021, the Company recognized an aggregate fair value of € 5.5 million ($ 6.3 million) for the acquired intangible assets. The Company made the first installment payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million) in February 2020, the second installment payment of € 1.8 million ($ 2.2 million) in February 2021, and the final installment payment of € 1.3 million ($ 1.5 million) in March 2022. The installment payments have been reported as cash outflows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 12 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) 7. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of September 30, 2022 , the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 87.3 million and a net gain of $ 0.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 50.0 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net lo ss of $ 0.8 million and $ 2.3 million for t he three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 , respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net gain of $ 0.3 million and of $ 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021 , respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022 and noted no impairment.

The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and include an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through March 2027 . The Company made principal payments of € 3.4 million ($ 3.5 million) towards its term loan and $ 34.3 million towards its revolving credit facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 200.0 million, from $ 495.0 million to $ 695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $ 200 million to $ 350 million. In connection with the Fifth Amendment, the Company capitalized $ 2.5 million deferred financing costs and recorded a $ 0.6 million loss from the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2022. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. 17 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Fair Value of Debt As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 11. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2022 and 2036 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewal options to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms.

Preferred and Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Preferred Shares In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares, fix the rights, preferences and designation, as deemed necessary or advisable, relating to the preferred shares, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share . As of September 30, 2022 , no preferred shares had been issued and outstanding. Common Share Repurchases In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the three months ended July 1, 2022, the Company completed the 2018 Repurchase Plan and repurchased 80 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 9.5 million at an average price of $ 118.97 per share. Since the inception of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, the Company has repurchased a cumulative total of 264 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 25.0 million at an average price of $ 94.57 per share. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the three months ended July 1, 2022, the Company repurchased 4 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 0.5 million at an average price of $ 116.95 per share under the 2020 Repurchase Plan.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) Share-based compensation expense reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directo rs of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, respectively. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors (the ""Board""). Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. Outstanding DSUs are converted into common shares upon Board members' resignation or retirement from the Board. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , 52 thousand shares of outstanding DSUs were converted into common shares upon the retirement or resignation of certain Board members. There were 38 thousand and 91 thousand DSUs o utstanding as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Outstanding DSUs are included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2022: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2021 292 $ 115.42 Granted 118 $ 136.41 Vested ( 135 ) $ 114.12 Forfeited ( 13 ) $ 126.79 Unvested at September 30, 2022 262 $ 124.72 Expected to vest as of September 30, 2022 242 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $ 18.1 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based stock awards, EPS-PSUs and TSR-PSUs, to certain members of the executive management team on an annual basis. Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following the vesting of EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following the vesting of TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte Carlo valuation method as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will ultimately vest at the end of the three-year performance period. 21 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) In January 2022, the Company granted ATI-PSUs to ATI employees. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting is determined based on a performance matrix for a four-year performance period against certain performance targets and will be in the range of zero to 100 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the four-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2022: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2021 162 $ 122.26 Granted 107 $ 159.00 Vested ( 41 ) $ 108.58 Forfeited ( 10 ) $ 156.62 Unvested at September 30, 2022 218 $ 144.40 Expected to vest as of September 30, 2022 230 The unvested PSUs are shown at target in the table above. As of September 30, 2022 , the maximum number of common shares to be earned under these PSU grants was approximately 343 thousand shares. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $ 7.2 million based on the market price of the underlying common shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method with the following assumptions: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Grant-date stock price $ 137.29 Expected volatility 40.33 % Risk-free interest rate 1.81 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 144.38 Stock Options In February 2022, the Company granted 40 thousand stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a strike price equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant. The stock options vest ratably over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire on the seven th anniversary of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in the consolidated statement of operations. 22 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes activities relating to stock options issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2022: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 60 $ 14.13 Granted 40 $ 135.86 Exercised — $ — Forfeited or expired — $ — Outstanding as of September 30, 2022 100 $ 62.77 Exercisable as of September 30, 2022 60 Expected to vest as of September 30, 2022 40 The aggregate Black-Scholes fair value of $ 1.9 million for the stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was estimated using the following assumptions as of the grant date: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Expected option term in years 4.5 Expected volatility 39.3 % Risk-free interest rate 1.83 % Expected annual dividend yield — The expected option term was calculated using the simplified method permitted under Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins Topic 14, “Share-Based Payment”. The expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common shares over the expected option term. Risk-free interest rate was based upon treasury instrument whose term was six months longer than the expected option term. The expected annual dividend yield is zero as the Company does not have plans to issue dividends. 13. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the period in which the changes are determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are not more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of adding a new or additional valuation allowance or releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. The Company's effective tax rate of 16.0 % for the three months ended September 30, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, and R&D tax credits, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. 23 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 (Unaudited) The Company's effective tax rate of 13.8 % for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 0.2 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. Beginn ing in January 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires that research and development (“R&D”) expenditures be capitalized and amortized for income tax purposes over five years for domestic research and fifteen years for foreign research, rather than being deducted as incurred. This has the effect of increasing the Company’s cash taxes and deferred tax assets. Since January 2022, the Company has recognized deferred tax assets of $ 9.2 million for the relevant R&D expenditures. This provision also has an indirect benefit of 3.8 % on the Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as the Company’s estimated Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction has increased as a result of increased U.S. taxable income. The provision for income taxes for both the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2022 reflects the impact of the TCJA. The Company’s effective tax rate of ( 0.6 %) for the three months ended October 1, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances. The Company’s effective tax rate of 2.0 % for the nine months ended October 1, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, a release of uncertain tax position reserves, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the U.K. corporate tax rate change and an increase in valuation allowances during the period. For the nine months ended October 1, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 14.5 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. 14.

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2021. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the potential loss or a range of potential losses, if such an estimate can be reasonably made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 26 NOVANTA INC.

The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures, particularly ophthalmology applications. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Vision Our Vision segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless technologies, video recorder and video integration technologies for operating room integrations; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies; and embedded touch screen solutions. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Precision Motion Our Precision Motion segment designs, manufactures and markets optical and inductive encoders, precision motors, servo drives and motion control solutions, integrated stepper motors, intelligent robotic end-of-arm technology solutions, air bearings, and air bearing spindles to customers worldwide. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the medical market accounted for approximately 48% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. 31 Advanced Industrial Market For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 52% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by several factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial conditions of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: Significant Events and Updates Acquisition of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. On August 11, 2022, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. (""MPH""), a Czech Republic-based manufacturer of medical consumables with plastics specialization in making disposable tub-set-like products, for a total purchase price of €21.8 million ($22.4 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The addition of MPH is expected to expand the Company's manufacturing capacity and capabilities in the medical disposable tube set products within the Vision reportable segment. Amendment to Credit Agreement On March 10, 2022, we entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2019 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Fifth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $200 million to $350 million. 32 Impact of COVID-19 and Supply Chain Disruptions on Our Business In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our major facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities and have adapted our COVID-19 safety measures as the pandemic and related government mandates evolved over the past two years. We expect to continue some of these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment, weekly testing of unvaccinated employees for COVID-19 at certain locations and rearranging some of our facilities to accommodate social distancing and flexible post-pandemic work environment. Infection rates and the corresponding public health restrictions varied across the countries in which we operate. Some governmental authorities have continued to implement numerous evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, masking recommendations and mandates, vaccine recommendations and mandates, limitations on gatherings, mandatory quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. While COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed in the U.S. and Europe, in response to outbreaks of infection in various locations within China, governmental authorities have implemented lockdown orders in some areas, significantly slowing economic and business activities. Our manufacturing and distribution operations in China have been impacted to a limited degree by these lockdowns. The extent to which government lockdowns in China or any other country will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Through September 30, 2022, we have experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers caused by these events could further challenge our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs where feasible to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising quality, performance or other requirements, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Despite our mitigation actions, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key part or component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs, and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for certain of our parts and primary raw materials as well as increases in the costs of labor, freight, packaging, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Russia Ukraine Conflict In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the United States, the European Union, and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the United States, the European Union, and several other countries. Our sales to Russia are not material. We continue to assess the conflict and related global sanctions and take steps to attempt to mitigate the potential negative impact on our business. Any longer-term impact to our business is currently unknown due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, any further global sanctions and their broader impact on the global economy and inflation. 33 Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Compared with the Three and Nine Months Ended October 1, 2021 Overview of Financial Results Total revenue of $223.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased $45.2 million, or 25.5%, from the prior year period primarily due to revenue from prior year acquisitions and increased demand in the advanced industrial and medical markets.

Our effective tax rate of (0.6%) for the three months ended October 1, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and a release of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of statutes of limitation, partially offset by an increase in our valuation allowance. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 13.8%, versus 2.0% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 13.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation expenses and uncertain tax position accruals. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 0.2% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of 2.0% for the nine months ended October 1, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, a release of uncertain tax positions reserves, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the U.K. corporate tax rate change during the period and an increase in our valuation allowances. For the nine months ended October 1, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 14.5% on our effective tax rate. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the ""IRA"") was passed into law on August 16, 2022. The provisions of the IRA will be effective beginning with fiscal year 2023, with certain exceptions. The IRA has several new provisions including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (""CAMT"") for certain large corporations that have at least an average of $1.0 billion of adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive three-tax-year period. The IRA also introduced a 1% excise tax imposed on certain stock 39 repurchases by publicly traded U.S. corporations made after December 31, 2022. Based on our initial evaluation, we do not believe the IRA will have a material impact on our income tax provision and cash taxes. We continue to monitor the changes in tax laws and regulations to evaluate their potential impact on our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $350.0 million by exercising the accordion option under our revolving credit agreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, worsening supply chain disruptions and electronics and other material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, higher interest rates in the U.S. and Europe, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Our cash requirements primarily consist of the principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, pension obligations, contingent considerations and earn-outs. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Through September 30, 2022, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2021. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of September 30, 2022, $57.7 million of our $84.6 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below). Approximately $137.9 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. We deferred certain U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. We paid $1.4 million of such deferred payroll tax payments in December 2021. As permitted under the CARES Act, we expect to pay the remaining $1.4 million of deferred U.S. Payroll taxes by December 31, 2022. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated 5-year term loan facility (approximately €90.2 million) and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. 40 In March 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $200 million to $350 million. As of September 30, 2022, we had $75.7 million term loan and $372.3 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75% and 1.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.30% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $137.9 million and $310.0 million, respectively. The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of September 30, 2022: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.50 2.33 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 8.89 Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We completed the 2018 Repurchase Plan in the second quarter of 2022 and repurchased 80 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $9.5 million at an average price of $118.97 per share. Since the inception of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, we have repurchased a cumulative total of 264 thousand shares at an average price of $94.57 per share. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased 4 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $0.5 million at an average price of $116.95 per share under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. As of September 30, 2022, we had $49.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. 41 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, October 1, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 50,167 $ 65,912 Net cash used in investing activities $ (38,283 ) $ (302,140 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (36,669 ) $ 214,290 September 30, December 31, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 84,580 $ 117,393 Unused and available funds under the revolving credit facility $ 322,713 $ 348,421 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $50.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, versus $65.9 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to a $46.6 million increase in inventories driven by increased customer demand and higher critical raw material purchases, a $34.4 million increase in accounts receivable primarily driven by increased revenue, and a bonus payout in 2022 of $8.4 million compared to no bonus payout in 2021 as a result of the elimination of our 2020 annual bonus plan, partially offset by an increase in profit before tax from higher revenue. Beginning in January 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires R&D expenditures be capitalized and amortized for income tax purposes over five years for domestic research and fifteen years for foreign research, rather than being deducted as incurred. This has the effect of increasing our cash taxes and deferred tax assets. If this provision under the TCJA is not deferred, modified, or repealed with retroactive effect going back to January 1, 2022, our operating cash flows are expected to decrease by approximately $9.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2022. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $38.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by the MPH acquisition. We paid cash consideration of $22.4 million, net of cash acquired. We also paid capital expenditures of $15.4 million and a contingent consideration payment of $1.5 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Cash used in investing activities was $302.1 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2021, primarily driven by the ATI and SEM acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid cash consideration of $285.2 million (net of cash acquired of $14.6 million) during the nine months ended October 1, 2021. We also paid capital expenditures of $14.8 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.2 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies during the nine months ended October 1, 2021. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $20 million to $25 million in 2022 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $36.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to $46.3 million of contingent consideration payments related to prior year acquisitions, $37.8 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments, $10.0 million of repurchases of common stock, $9.6 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, and $2.5 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Fifth Amendment, partially offset by $69.9 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the contingent consideration paid for the ATI acquisition and cash consideration paid for the MPH acquisition. Cash provided by financing activities was $214.3 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2021, primarily due to $280.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the cash considerations paid for the ATI and SEM acquisitions, partially offset by $30.7 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $24.0 million of term loan 42 and revolver credit facility repayments, $8.7 million payment for the purchase of a building under a finance lease agreement, and $1.8 million of contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions.

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. Adoption of ASU 2020-04 is elective. In March 2022, the Company amended the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and replaced LIBOR with SOFR as the new reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings. The ASU did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2021-08 requires that entities recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. ASU 2021-08 also applies to contract assets or liabilities from other contracts to which the provisions of ASC 606 apply. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 do not affect the accounting for other assets or liabilities that may arise from revenue contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606, such as refund liabilities, or in a business combination, such as customer-related intangible assets and contract-based intangible assets. January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 as of January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not have any material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time. As the Company’s right to payment from a customer is based on the value of engineering services performed, the Company recognizes revenue based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Revenue from engineering services aggregated to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue during the six months ended July 1, 2022 and July 2, 2021. 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The standard warranty periods for the Company’s products are typically 12 months to 36 months . The Company recognizes estimated liabilities associated with standard warranty periods for its products in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liabilities and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liabilities. A provision for the estimated cost related to standard warranties is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of the costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities are recorded at that time, with offsetting adjustments to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred because the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of July 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, contract liabilities were $ 7.9 million and $ 7.3 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the six months ended July 1, 2022 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, partially offset by $ 3.6 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2021. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 15 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Loss Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2021 $ ( 12,866 ) $ ( 5,753 ) $ ( 7,113 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 18,009 ) ( 18,699 ) 690 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 210 — 210 Balance at July 1, 2022 $ ( 30,665 ) $ ( 24,452 ) $ ( 6,213 ) The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 4. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three and six months ended July 1, 2022 and July 2, 2021, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per common share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”) and certain other performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares from the TSR-PSUs are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. The dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares from other PSUs are included in the weighted average common share calculation only when the performance targets have been achieved based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets as of the end of the reporting period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 1, July 2, July 1, July 2, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 17,479 $ 11,664 $ 36,299 $ 22,974 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,609 35,374 35,573 35,326 Dilutive potential common shares 324 389 284 449 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,933 35,763 35,857 35,775 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 146 25 120 23 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.49 $ 0.33 $ 1.02 $ 0.65 Diluted $ 0.49 $ 0.33 $ 1.01 $ 0.64 For both the three and six months ended July 1, 2022, 35 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and 37 thousand operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”) granted to certain members of the executive management team, and 53 thousand performance-based restricted stock units granted to ATI Industrial 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) Automation employees (“ ATI-PSUs ”) are considered attainment-based contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of July 1 , 202 2 . For both the three and six months ended July 2, 2021, 46 thousand EPS-PSUs and 37 thousand OCF-PSUs granted to certain members of the executive management team, and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders were considered attainment-based contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of July 2, 2021. 5. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On August 30, 2021, the Company acquired ATI Industrial Automation Inc. (“ATI”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ATI acquisition, the former shareholders of ATI (the “Sellers”) are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on ATI’s fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement. The contingent consideration will be payable in the third quarter of 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. The fair value of the contingent consideration was $ 44.0 million as of December 31, 2021. During the three months ended July 1, 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to $ 45.0 million based on the final determination of ATI’s 2021 Adjusted EBITDA between the Company and the Sellers. On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). During 2021, the Company made the first 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2021 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 3.3 million ($ 3.8 million) as of December 31, 2021 . During 2022, the Company made the second installment payment of € 0.3 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2022 . The installment payments are reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projection as of April 1, 2022 , the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 1.4 million ($ 1.4 million). There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three and six months ended July 1 , 202 2 . On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million ($ 9.0 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million) in May 2020 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 2.3 million ($ 2.9 million) as of the end of the year. During 2021, the Company made the second installment payment of € 1.2 million ($ 1.4 million) in May 2021 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 1.5 million ($ 1.7 million) as of the end of the year. The installment payments are reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. During the six months ended July 1, 2022, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 1.8 million ($ 1.9 million), which is expected to be paid during the three months ending October 1, 2022. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and are amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. Based on revenue achievements against the target, the Company had recognized an aggregate fair value of € 5.5 million ($ 6.3 million) of the acquired intangible assets as of July 1, 2022. The Company made the first installment payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million) in February 2020, the second installment payment of € 1.8 million ($ 2.2 million) in February 2021, and the final installment payment of € 1.3 million ($ 1.5 million) in March 2022. The installment payments have been reported as cash outflows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three and six month ended July 1, 2022. 11 NOVANTA INC.

See Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt. 6. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of July 1, 2022, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 58.7 million and a net gain of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 50.0 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net loss of $ 1.4 million and $ 1.5 million for the three and six months ended July 1, 2022, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net loss of $ 0.1 million and an aggregate net gain of $ 0.6 million for the three and six months ended July 2, 2021, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022 and noted no impairment. 13 NOVANTA INC.

The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and includes an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through March 2027 . The Company made principal payments of € 2.3 million ($ 2.4 million) towards its term loan and $ 10.4 million towards its revolving credit facility during the six months ended July 1, 2022. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 200.0 million, from $ 495.0 million to $ 695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. 16 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U .

In connection with the Fifth Amendment, t he Company capitalized $ 2.5 million deferred financing costs and recorded a $ 0.6 million loss from the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs . The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of July 1, 2022. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. Fair Value of Debt As of July 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 10. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2022 and 2036 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewal options to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) Share-based compensation expense reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.1 million during the six months ended July 1, 2022 and July 2, 2021, respectively. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 88 thousand and 91 thousand DSUs outstanding as of July 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Outstanding DSUs are included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended July 1, 2022: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2021 292 $ 115.42 Granted 101 $ 136.54 Vested ( 130 ) $ 115.17 Forfeited ( 10 ) $ 127.12 Unvested at July 1, 2022 253 $ 123.71 Expected to vest as of July 1, 2022 231 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the six months ended July 1, 2022 was $ 17.4 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based stock awards, EPS-PSUs and TSR-PSUs, to certain members of the executive management team on an annual basis. Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following the vesting of EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following the vesting of TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte Carlo valuation method as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will ultimately vest at the end of the three-year performance period. 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) In January 2022, the Company granted ATI-PSU s to ATI employees. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting is determined based on a performance matrix for a four-year performance period against certain performance targets and will be in the range of zero to 100 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the four-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement s of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended July 1, 2022: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2021 162 $ 122.26 Granted 102 $ 158.55 Vested ( 41 ) $ 108.58 Forfeited ( 8 ) $ 153.47 Unvested at July 1, 2022 215 $ 144.12 Expected to vest as of July 1, 2022 210 The unvested PSUs are shown at target in the table above. As of July 1, 2022, the maximum number of common shares to be earned under these PSU grants was approximately 337 thousand shares. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the six months ended July 1, 2022 was $ 7.2 million based on the market price of the underlying common shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method with the following assumptions: Six Months Ended July 1, 2022 Grant-date stock price $ 135.86 Expected volatility 40.70 % Risk-free interest rate 1.69 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 141.52 Stock Options In February 2022, the Company granted 40 thousand stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a strike price equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant. The stock options vest ratably over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire on the seventh anniversary of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in the consolidated statement of operations. 21 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes activities relating to stock options issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended July 1, 2022: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 60 $ 14.13 Granted 40 $ 135.86 Exercised — $ — Forfeited or expired — $ — Outstanding as of July 1, 2022 100 $ 62.77 Exercisable as of July 1, 2022 60 Expected to vest as of July 1, 2022 40 The aggregate Black-Scholes fair value of $ 1.9 million for the stock options granted during the six months ended July 1, 2022 was estimated using the following assumptions as of the grant date: Six Months Ended July 1, 2022 Expected option term in year 4.5 Expected volatility 39.3 % Risk-free interest rate 1.83 % Expected annual dividend yield — The expected option term was calculated using the simplified method permitted under Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins Topic 14, “Share-Based Payment”. The expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common shares over the expected option term. Risk-free interest rate was based upon treasury instrument whose term was half year longer than the expected option term. The expected annual dividend yield is zero as the Company does not have plans to issue dividends. 12. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the period in which the changes are determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are not more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of adding a new or additional valuation allowance or releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. The Company’s effective tax rate of 15.8 % for the three months ended July 1, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, and R&D tax credits, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. 22 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) The Company’s effective tax rate of 12.4 % for the six months ended July 1, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals . For the six months ended July 1, 2022 , the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 1.4 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. Beginning in January 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires research and development (“R&D”) expenditures be capitalized and amortized for income tax purposes over five years for domestic research and fifteen years for foreign research, rather than being deducted as incurred. This has the effect of increasing the Company’s cash taxes and deferred tax assets. Since January 2022, the Company has recognized deferred tax assets of $ 6.3 million for the relevant R&D expenditures. This provision also has an indirect benefit of 3 % on the Company’s effective tax rate for the six months ended July 1, 2022, as the Company’s estimated Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction has increased as a result of increased US taxable income. The provision for income taxes for both the three months and the six months ended July 1, 2022 reflects the impact of the TCJA. The Company’s effective tax rate of 19.2 % for the three months ended July 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and a release of uncertain tax position reserves, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the U.K. corporate tax rate change. The Company’s effective tax rate of 3.5 % for the six months ended July 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, a release of uncertain tax position reserves, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the U.K. corporate tax rate change during the period. For the six months ended July 2, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 14.7 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. 13. Restructuring, Acquisition, and Related Costs The following table summarizes restructuring, acquisition, and related costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 1, July 2, July 1, July 2, 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 restructuring $ 610 $ 1,165 $ 1,232 $ 2,503 2019 restructuring — — — 208 Total restructuring charges 610 1,165 1,232 2,711 Acquisition and related charges 2,045 3,469 ( 207 ) 5,654 Total restructuring, acquisition, and related costs $ 2,655 $ 4,634 $ 1,025 $ 8,365 2020 Restructuring As a result of the Company’s ongoing evaluations and efforts to reduce its operating costs, while improving efficiency and effectiveness, the Company initiated the 2020 restructuring program in the third quarter of 2020. This program is focused on reducing operating complexity in the Company, including reducing infrastructure costs and streamlining the Company’s operating model to better serve its customers. In addition, the program is focused on cost reduction actions that improve gross margins for the overall company. During the three and six months ended July 1, 2022, the Company recorded $ 0.6 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively, in severance and other costs in connection with the 2020 restructuring program. As of July 1, 2022, the Company had incurred cumulative costs related to this restructuring plan totaling $ 9.3 million. The Company anticipates substantially completing the 2020 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2022 and expects to incur additional restructuring charges of $ 3.0 million to $ 3.5 million related to the 2020 restructuring program. 23 NOVANTA INC.

The majority of acquisition and related costs for the three and six months ended July 2, 2021 were included in the Company’s Precision Motion, Vision, and Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services reportable segments. 14. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2021. 24 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 1, 2022 (Unaudited) Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the potential loss or a range of potential losses, if such an estimate can be reasonably made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director or officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding by reason of their relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors and officers liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 15. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers. Based upon the information provided to the CODM, the Company has determined that it operates in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities are described below.

End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the six months ended July 1, 2022, the medical market accounted for approximately 47% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. 29 Advanced Industrial Market For the six months ended July 1, 2022, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 53% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by several factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial conditions of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing components and sub-systems to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, intelligent end-of-arm robotic technology solutions, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On March 10, 2022, we entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the third amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 31, 2019 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Fifth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $200 million to $350 million. Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our major facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities and have adapted our COVID-19 safety measures as the pandemic and related government mandates evolved over the past 30 two years. We expect to continue some of these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment, weekly testing of unvaccinated employees for COVID-19 at certain locations and rearranging some of our facilities to accommodate social distancing and flexible post-pandemic work environment. Infection rates and the corresponding public health restrictions vary across the countries in which we operate. Many governmental authorities have continued to implement numerous evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, masking recommendations and mandates, vaccine recommendations and mandates, limitations on gatherings, mandatory quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. While COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed in the U.S. and Europe, in response to outbreaks of infection in various locations within China, governmental authorities have implemented lockdown orders in some areas, significantly slowing economic and business activities. Our manufacturing and distribution operations in Suzhou, China have been impacted to a limited degree by these recent lockdowns. The extent to which government lockdowns in China or any other country will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Through July 1, 2022 , we have experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers caused by these events could further challenge our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs where feasible to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising quality, performance or other requirements, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Despite our mitigation actions, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key part or component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs, and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for certain of our parts and primary raw materials as well as increases in the costs of labor, freight, packaging, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Russia Ukraine Conflict In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the United States, the European Union, and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the United States, the European Union, and several other countries. Our sales to Russia are not material. We continue to assess the conflict and related global sanctions and take steps to attempt to mitigate the potential negative impact on our business. Any longer-term impact to our business is currently unknown due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, any further global sanctions and their broader impact on the global economy and inflation. 31 Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended July 1, 2022 Compared with the Three and Six Months Ended July 2, 2021 The following table sets forth our unaudited results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 1, July 2, July 1, July 2, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 55.8 56.8 55.8 57.2 Gross profit 44.2 43.2 44.2 42.8 Operating expenses: Research and development and engineering 10.0 10.1 10.1 10.8 Selling, general and administrative 18.8 18.6 19.0 19.1 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 3.3 2.1 3.5 2.2 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs 1.2 2.8 0.2 2.5 Total operating expenses 33.4 33.7 32.9 34.6 Operating income 10.8 9.5 11.3 8.2 Interest income (expense), net (1.3 ) (0.8 ) (1.4 ) (0.8 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net 0.1 (0.0 ) 0.1 (0.1 ) Other income (expense), net 0.0 (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Income before income taxes 9.6 8.6 9.9 7.2 Income tax provision (benefit) 1.5 1.7 1.2 0.3 Consolidated net income 8.1 % 7.0 % 8.7 % 7.0 % Overview of Financial Results Total revenue of $215.4 million for the three months ended July 1, 2022 increased $47.8 million, or 28.6%, from the prior year period primarily due to revenue from prior year acquisitions and increased demand in the advanced industrial and medical markets.

Our effective tax rate of 19.2% for the three months ended July 2, 2021, differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and a release of uncertain tax position reserves, offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the U.K. corporate tax rate change. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended July 1, 2022 was 12.4%, versus 3.5% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 12.4% for the six months ended July 1, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, R&D tax credits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. For the six months ended July 1, 2022, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 1.4% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of 3.5% for the six months ended July 2, 2021, differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, a release of uncertain tax positions reserves, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the U.K. corporate tax rate change during the period. For the six months ended July 2, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 14.7% on our effective tax rate. Beginning in January 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires R&D expenditures be capitalized and amortized for income tax purposes over five years for domestic research and fifteen years for foreign research, rather than being deducted as incurred. This has the effect of increasing our cash taxes and deferred tax assets. Since January 2022, the Company has recognized deferred tax assets of $6.3 million for the relevant R&D expenditures. This provision also has an indirect benefit of 3% on our effective tax rate for the six months ended July 1, 2022, as our estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income has increased as a result of increased U.S. taxable income. The provision for income taxes for both the three months and the six months ended July 1, 2022 reflects the impact of the TCJA. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $350.0 million by exercising the accordion option under our revolving credit agreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening supply chain disruptions and electronics and other material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, higher interest rates in the U.S. and Europe, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. 38 Our cash requirements primarily consist of the principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, pension obligations, contingent considerations and earn-outs. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. T hrough July 1, 2022 , we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 20 21 . Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of July 1, 2022, $72.5 million of our $100.5 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below). Approximately $144.8 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the U.S. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. We deferred certain U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. We paid $1.4 million of such deferred payroll tax payments in December 2021. As permitted under the CARES Act, we expect to pay the remaining $1.4 million deferred U.S. Payroll taxes by December 31, 2022. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated 5-year term loan facility (approximately €90.2 million) and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. In March 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $200 million to $350 million. As of July 1, 2022, we had $82.2 million term loan and $330.6 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75% and 1.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.30% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of July 1, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $144.8 million and $268.0 million, respectively. 39 The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenant s and our compliance therewith as of July 1 , 202 2 : Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.50 2.23 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 9.83 (1) Maximum consolidated leverage ratio shall be increased to 4.00 for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition, as defined in the Fifth Amendment. Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the six months ended July 1, 2022, we repurchased 80 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $9.5 million at an average price of $118.97 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. As of July 1, 2022, we had repurchased a cumulative total of 264 thousand shares under the 2018 Repurchase Plan for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million at an average price of $94.57 per share. As of July 1, 2022, we had completed the 2018 Repurchase Plan. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the six months ended July 1, 2022, we repurchased 4 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $0.5 million at an average price of $116.95 per share under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. As of July 1, 2022, we had $49.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended July 1, 2022 and July 2, 2021 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Six Months Ended July 1, July 2, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 35,408 $ 52,014 Net cash used in investing activities $ (12,616 ) $ (10,843 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (35,473 ) $ (31,994 ) July 1, December 31, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 100,489 $ 117,393 Unused and available funds under the revolving credit facility $ 364,441 $ 348,421 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $35.4 million for the six months ended July 1, 2022, versus $52.0 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended July 1, 2022 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to a $33.5 million increase in inventories driven by increased customer demand and higher critical raw material 40 purchases , and a bonus payout in 2022 of $8.4 million compared to no bonus payout in 2021 as a result of the elimination of our 2020 annual bonus plan, partially offset by an increase in profit before tax from higher revenue . Beginning in January 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires R&D expenditures be capitalized and amortized for income tax purposes over five years for domestic research and fifteen years for foreign research, rather than being deducted as incurred. This has the effect of increasing our cash taxes and deferred tax assets. If this provision under the TCJA is not deferred, modified, or repealed with retroactive effect going back to January 1, 2022, our operating cash flows are expected to decrease by approximately $10.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2022. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $12.6 million for the six months ended July 1, 2022, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $12.1 million and a contingent consideration payment of $1.5 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. Cash used in investing activities was $10.8 million for the six months ended July 2, 2021, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $8.6 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.2 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $25 million to $30 million in 2022 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $35.5 million for the six months ended July 1, 2022, primarily due to $10 million of repurchase of common stock, $9.5 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $12.8 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments, and $2.5 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Fifth Amendment. Cash used in financing activities was $32.0 million for the six months ended July 2, 2021, primarily due to $18.4 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, an $8.7 million payment for the purchase of a building under a finance lease agreement, $2.7 million of term loan repayments, and $1.8 million of contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through July 1, 2022 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 1 , 202 2 . Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended July 1, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 42 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. Adoption of ASU 2020-04 is elective. In March 2022, the Company amended the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and replaced LIBOR with SOFR as the new reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings. The ASU did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2021-08 requires that entities recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. ASU 2021-08 also applies to contract assets or liabilities from other contracts to which the provisions of ASC 606 apply. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 do not affect the accounting for other assets or liabilities that may arise from revenue contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606, such as refund liabilities, or in a business combination, such as customer-related intangible assets and contract-based intangible assets. January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 as of January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not have any material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time. As the Company’s right to payment from a customer is based on the value of engineering services performed, the Company recognizes revenue based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Revenue from engineering services aggregated to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue during the three months ended April 1, 2022 and April 2, 2021. 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 36 months . The Company recognizes liabilities associated with standard warranty periods for its products in accordance with the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liabilities and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liabilities. A provision for the estimated cost related to standard warranties is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of the costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities are recorded at that time, with offsetting adjustments to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, contract liabilities were $ 7.5 million and $ 7.3 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the three months ended April 1, 2022 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, partially offset by $ 3.2 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance as of December 31, 2021. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 15 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Loss Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2021 $ ( 12,866 ) $ ( 5,753 ) $ ( 7,113 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 4,568 ) ( 4,772 ) 204 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 109 — 109 Balance at April 1, 2022 $ ( 17,325 ) $ ( 10,525 ) $ ( 6,800 ) The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 4. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three months ended April 1, 2022 and April 2, 2021, respectively, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per common share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”), determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”) noncontrolling interest shareholders, non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”), operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”), and performance-based restricted stock units granted to the ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. (“ATI”) employees (“ATI-PSUs”) are included in the weighted average common share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets as of the end of each reporting period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended April 1, April 2, 2022 2021 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 18,820 $ 11,310 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,538 35,279 Dilutive potential common shares 243 510 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,781 35,789 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 93 27 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.53 $ 0.32 Diluted $ 0.53 $ 0.32 For the three months ended April 1, 2022, 36 thousand EPS-PSUs and 37 thousand OCF-PSUs granted to certain members of the executive management team, 55 thousand ATI-PSUs, and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) Quantum non-controlling interest share holders are considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of April 1 , 202 2 . For the three months ended April 2, 2021, 46 thousand EPS-PSUs and 37 thousand OCF-PSUs granted to certain members of the executive management team, and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of April 2, 2021. 5. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On August 30, 2021, the Company acquired ATI. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ATI acquisition, the former shareholders of ATI are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on ATI’s fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement. The contingent consideration will be payable in 2022. The preliminary fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Once the fair value of the contingent consideration is finalized, subsequent changes in the estimated fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. The fair value of the contingent consideration was $ 44.0 million as of December 31, 2021. There were no changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three months ended April 1, 2022. On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). During 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 3.3 million ($ 3.8 million). The Company made the first installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) million) in March 2021 and the second installment payment of € 0.3 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2022 . These installment payments are reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections as of April 1, 2022, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 1.4 million ($ 1.5 million). There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three months ended April 1 , 202 2 . On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million ($ 9.0 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 2.3 million ($ 2.9 million). During 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 1.5 million ($ 1.7 million).The Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million) in May 2020 and the second installment payment of € 1.2 million ($ 1.4 million) in May 2021. These installment payments are reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. Based on the revenue performance as of April 1, 2022, the end of the relevant performance period, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 1.1 million ($ 1.2 million). There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three month ended April 1, 2022. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. Based on revenue achievements against the target, the Company had recognized an aggregate fair value of € 5.5 million ($ 6.3 million) of the acquired intangible assets as of April 1, 2022.

See Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt. 6. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of April 1, 2022, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 40.6 million and a net gain of $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 50.0 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net loss of $ 0.1 million and an aggregate net gain of $ 0.7 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022 and April 2, 2021, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021 and noted no impairment. 13 NOVANTA INC.

The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and includes an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through March 2027 . The Company made principal payments of € 1.1 million ($ 1.2 million) towards its term loan and $ 10.4 million towards its revolving credit facility during the three months ended April 1, 2022. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 200.0 million, from $ 495.0 million to $ 695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for US dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $ 200 million to $ 350 million. In connection with the Fifth Amendment, the Company capitalized $ 2.5 million deferred financing costs and recorded a $ 0.6 million loss from the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs. 16 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of April 1 , 202 2 . Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. Fair Value of Debt As of April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 10. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2022 and 2036 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewal options to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms.

Preferred and Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Preferred Shares In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares, fix the rights, preferences and designation, as deemed necessary or advisable, relating to the preferred shares, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share . As of April 1, 2022, no preferred shares had been issued and outstanding. Common Share Repurchases In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. As of April 1, 2022, the Company had $ 59.5 million available for future share repurchases under these share repurchase plans. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 1, April 2, 2022 2021 Selling, general and administrative $ 5,201 $ 4,929 Research and development and engineering 700 727 Cost of revenue 873 988 Total share-based compensation expense $ 6,774 $ 6,644 Share-based compensation expense reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 1.0 million and $ 1.1 million during the three months ended April 1, 2022 and April 2, 2021, respectively. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on an ticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 90 thousand and 91 thousand DSUs outstanding as of April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Outstanding DSUs are included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended April 1, 2022: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2021 292 $ 115.42 Granted 81 $ 139.46 Vested ( 95 ) $ 108.01 Forfeited ( 1 ) $ 127.39 Unvested at April 1, 2022 277 $ 124.92 Expected to vest as of April 1, 2022 254 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the three months ended April 1, 2022 was $ 12.9 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based stock awards, EPS-PSUs and TSR-PSUs, to certain members of the executive management team on an annual basis. Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte Carlo valuation method as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. In January 2022, the Company granted ATI-PSUs to ATI employees. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting is determined based on a performance matrix for a four-year performance period against certain performance targets and will be in the range of zero to 100 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the four-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made. 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended April 1, 2022: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2021 162 $ 122.26 Granted 102 $ 158.59 Vested ( 41 ) $ 108.58 Forfeited ( 1 ) $ 173.77 Unvested at April 1, 2022 222 $ 144.25 Expected to vest as of April 1, 2022 213 The unvested PSUs are shown at target in the table above. As of April 1, 2022, the maximum number of common shares to be earned under these PSU grants was approximately 350 thousand shares. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the three months ended April 1, 2022 was $ 7.2 million based on the market price of the underlying common shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method with the following assumptions: Three Months Ended April 1, 2022 Grant-date stock price $ 135.86 Expected volatility 40.70 % Risk-free interest rate 1.69 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 141.52 Stock Options In February 2022, the Company granted 40 thousand stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a strike price equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant. The stock options vest ratably over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire on the seventh anniversary of the date of grant. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to the stock options on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in the consolidated statement of operations. The table below summarizes activities relating to stock options issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended April 1, 2022: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 60 $ 14.13 Granted 40 $ 135.86 Exercised — $ — Forfeited or expired — $ — Outstanding as of April 1, 2022 100 $ 62.77 Exercisable as of April 1, 2022 60 Expected to vest as of April 1, 2022 40 21 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) The aggregate Black-Scholes fair value of $ 1.9 million for the stock options granted during the three months ended April 1, 2022 was estimated using the following assumptions as of the grant date: Three Months Ended April 1, 2022 Expected option term in year (1) 4.5 Expected volatility (2) 39.3 % Risk-free interest rate (3) 1.83 % Expected annual dividend yield (4) — (1) The expected option term was calculated using the simplified method provided by Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins Topic 14: “Share-Based Payment”. ( 2 ) The expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common shares over the expected option term. (3) Risk-free interest rate was based upon treasury instrument whose term was half year longer than the expected option term. ( 4 ) The expected annual dividend yield is zero , as the Company does not have plans to issue dividends. 12. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the period in which the changes are determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of adding a new or additional valuation allowance or releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. The Company’s effective tax rate of 9.1 % for the three months ended April 1, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. For the three months ended April 1, 2022, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 3 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of ( 20.8 %) for the three months ended April 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended April 2, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 35.9 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. 22 NOVANTA INC.

The majority of acquisition and related costs for the three months ended April 1, 2022 were included in the Company’s Precision Motion and Photonics reportable segments. The majority of acquisition and related costs for the three months ended April 2, 2021 were included in the Company’s Precision Motion and Vision reportable segments. 14. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2021. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the potential loss or a range of potential losses, if such an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, 24 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 1, 2022 (Unaudited) among other things, that the director or officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding by reason of their relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors and officers liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 15.

Business Overview We are a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. Reportable Segments We operate in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics Our Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures, particularly ophthalmology applications.

The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the three months ended April 1, 2022, the medical market accounted for approximately 47% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the three months ended April 1, 2022, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 53% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology 29 requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial condition s of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market . Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing components and sub-systems to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, intelligent end-of-arm robotic technology solutions, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On March 10, 2022, we entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the third amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 31, 2019 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). The Fifth Amendment amends the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for US dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $200 million to $350 million. Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our major facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities and have adapted our COVID-19 safety measures as the pandemic and related government mandates evolved over the past two years. We expect to continue some of these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment, weekly testing of unvaccinated employees for COVID-19 at certain locations and rearranging some of our facilities to accommodate social distancing and flexible post-pandemic work environment. 30 Infection rates and the corresponding public health restrictions vary across the countries in which we operate. Many g overnmental authorities have continued to implement numerous evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, masking recommendations and mandates, vaccine recommendations and mandates, limit ation s on gatherings, mandatory quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. While COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed in the U.S. and Europe, in response to outbreak s of infection in various locations within China , governmental authorities have implemented lockdown order s in some areas , significantly slowing economic and business activit ies . Our manufacturing and distribution operations in Suzhou, China have been impacted to a limited degree by these recent lockdowns. The extent to which government lockdowns in China or any other country will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time . Through April 1, 2022 , we have experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers caused by these events could further challenge our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs to allow for alternative components to be used where feasible without compromising quality, performance or other requirements, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Despite of our mitigation actions, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key part or component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs, and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for certain of our parts and primary raw materials as well as increases in the costs of labor, freight, packaging, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Russia Ukraine Conflict In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the United States, European Union, and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions, and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the United States, European Union, and several other countries. Our sales to Russia are not material. We continue to assess the conflict and related global sanctions and take steps to attempt to mitigate the potential negative impact on our business. Any longer-term impact to our business is currently unknown due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, any further global sanctions and their broader impact on the global economy and inflation. 31 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended April 1, 2022 Compared with the Three Months Ended April 2, 2021 The following table sets forth our unaudited results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended April 1, April 2, 2022 2021 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 55.8 57.7 Gross profit 44.2 42.3 Operating expenses: Research and development and engineering 10.2 11.5 Selling, general and administrative 19.3 19.5 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 3.6 2.2 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs (0.8 ) 2.3 Total operating expenses 32.3 35.5 Operating income 11.9 6.8 Interest income (expense), net (1.5 ) (0.9 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net 0.0 (0.2 ) Other income (expense), net (0.3 ) (0.0 ) Income before income taxes 10.1 5.7 Income tax provision (benefit) 0.9 (1.2 ) Consolidated net income 9.2 % 6.9 % Overview of Financial Results Total revenue of $204.2 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022 increased $41.6 million, or 25.6%, from the prior year period primarily due to increased demand in the advanced industrial market related to microelectronics applications and as a result of increases in industrial manufacturing spending compared to the prior year period, as well as revenue from prior year acquisitions. The effect of our prior year acquisitions resulted in an increase in revenue of $32.8 million, or 20.2%. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue by $3.3 million, or 2.0%, for the three months ended April 1, 2022. Operating income of $24.3 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022 increased $13.2 million, or 118.8%, from the prior year period. This increase was attributable to an increase in gross profit of $21.5 million primarily attributable to higher revenue, an increase in gross profit margin, and a decrease in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $5.4 million, partially offset by an increase in research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses of $2.2 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $7.7 million and an increase in amortization expense of $3.8 million. Basic earnings per common share (“Basic EPS”) of $0.53 for the three months ended April 1, 2022 increased $0.21 from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per common share (“Diluted EPS”) of $0.53 for the three months ended April 1, 2022 increased $0.21 from the prior year period. The increases were primarily attributable to an increase in operating income, partially offset by increases in interest expense and income tax provision. Revenue The following table sets forth external revenue by reportable segment for the periods noted (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 1, April 2, Increase Percentage 2022 2021 (Decrease) Change Photonics $ 62,782 $ 58,493 $ 4,289 7.3 % Vision 62,050 67,636 (5,586 ) (8.3 )% Precision Motion 79,384 36,455 42,929 117.8 % Total $ 204,216 $ 162,584 $ 41,632 25.6 % 32 Photonics Photonics segment revenue for the three months ended April 1, 2022 increased by $4.3 million, or 7.3%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to increased demand in advanced industrial and medical markets. Vision Vision segment revenue for the three months ended April 1, 2022 decreased by $5.6 million, or 8.3%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to raw materials shortage and demand dynamics resulting from continued deferrals of elective surgical procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment revenue for the three months ended April 1, 2022 increased by $42.9 million, or 117.8%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to $32.8 million of revenue contributions from 2021 acquisitions and increased demand in advanced industrial and medical markets. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin The following table sets forth the gross profit and gross profit margin for each of our reportable segments for the periods noted (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 1, April 2, 2022 2021 Gross profit: Photonics $ 28,387 $ 28,109 Vision 25,230 26,926 Precision Motion 38,150 16,077 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (1,491 ) (2,372 ) Total $ 90,276 $ 68,740 Gross profit margin: Photonics 45.2 % 48.1 % Vision 40.7 % 39.8 % Precision Motion 48.1 % 44.1 % Total 44.2 % 42.3 % Gross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, trade tariffs, freight costs, headcount, inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses. Photonics Photonics segment gross profit for the three months ended April 1, 2022 increased $0.3 million, or 1.0%, versus the prior year period, due to an increase in revenue. Photonics segment gross profit margin was 45.2% for the three months ended April 1, 2022 versus a gross profit margin of 48.1% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to supply chain disruptions and overall raw material cost inflation. Vision Vision segment gross profit for the three months ended April 1, 2022 decreased $1.7 million, or 6.3%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in revenue. Vision segment gross profit margin was 40.7% for the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus a gross profit margin of 39.8% for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to improved factory efficiency. 33 Precision Motion Precision Motion segment gross profit for the three months ended April 1, 2022 increased $22.1 million, or 137.3%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in both revenue and gross profit margin. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 48.1% for the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus a gross profit margin of 44.1% for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to improved factory efficiency and utilization. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments. These costs for the three months ended April 1, 2022 decreased by $0.9 million versus the prior year period primarily due to reduced COVID-19 testing costs for employees of $1.3 million. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expenses for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 1, April 2, 2022 2021 Research and development and engineering $ 20,929 $ 18,682 Selling, general and administrative 39,352 31,653 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 7,342 3,575 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs (1,630 ) 3,731 Total $ 65,993 $ 57,641 Research and Development and Engineering Expenses R&D expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. R&D expenses were $20.9 million, or 10.2% of revenue, during the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $18.7 million, or 11.5% of revenue, during the prior year period. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to expenses related to 2021 acquisitions. R&D expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to leverage from higher sales. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems, and executive management functions. SG&A expenses were $39.4 million, or 19.3% of revenue, during the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $31.7 million, or 19.5% of revenue, during the prior year period. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to SG&A expenses related to 2021 acquisitions and increases in variable compensation and discretionary spending. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $7.3 million, or 3.6% of revenue, during the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $3.6 million, or 2.2% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was the result of more acquired intangible assets from 2021 acquisitions. Restructuring, Acquisition, and Related Costs We recorded restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $(1.6) million during the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $3.7 million during the prior year period. The acquisition and related costs decreased primarily due to a $3.2 million reduction in earnout expenses related to prior year acquisitions and a $0.9 million reduction in legal fees. The restructuring costs decreased $0.9 million related to decreased spending for the 2020 restructuring plan. 34 Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 1, April 2, 2022 2021 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 13,435 $ 12,395 Vision 5,042 3,366 Precision Motion 18,338 7,446 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (12,532 ) (12,108 ) Total $ 24,283 $ 11,099 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $13.4 million, or 21.4% of revenue, during the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $12.4 million, or 21.2% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring, acquisition and related cost of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expense of $0.6 million. Vision Vision segment operating income was $5.0 million, or 8.1% of revenue, during the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $3.4 million, or 5.0% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $1.6 million and a decrease in R&D spending of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of $1.7 million. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $18.4 million, or 23.1% of revenue, during the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $7.4 million, or 20.4% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $22.1 million and a decrease of restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $2.1 million, partially offset by increases in R&D spending of $3.6 million, SG&A expenses of $5.7 million and amortization expense of $4.0 million primarily as a result of prior year acquisitions. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition costs. These costs for the three months ended April 1, 2022 increased by $0.4 million versus the prior year period primarily due to an increase in SG&A spending of $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in costs related to COVID-19 testing for employees of $1.3 million included in cost of revenue. Other Income and Expense Items The following table sets forth other income and expense items for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 1, April 2, 2022 2021 Interest income (expense), net $ (3,109 ) $ (1,408 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net $ 69 $ (257 ) Other income (expense), net $ (545 ) $ (70 ) Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $3.1 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $1.4 million in the prior year period. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels and an increase in the weighted average interest 35 rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 2 . 49 % during the three months ended April 1 , 202 2 , versus 2 . 02 % during the prior year period. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $0.1 million of net gain for the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $(0.3) million of net losses in the prior year period. Other Income (Expense), Net Other expense was $0.5 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $0.1 million in the prior year period. The increase in other expense was primarily due to $0.6 million of loss from the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing cost as a result of the Fifth Amendment. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) Our effective tax rate for the three months ended April 1, 2022 was 9.1%, versus (20.8)% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 9.1% for the three months ended April 1, 2022 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by disallowed compensation and uncertain tax position accruals. For the three months ended April 1, 2022, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 3% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of (20.8)% for the three months ended April 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended April 2, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 35.9% on our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $350.0 million by exercising the accordion option under our revolving credit agreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening supply chain disruptions and electronics and other material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Our cash requirements primarily consist of the principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, pension obligations, contingent considerations and earn-outs. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. T hrough April 1, 2022, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2021 . 36 Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of April 1, 2022, $64.7 million of our $98.8 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below). Approximately $155.2 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. We deferred certain U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. We paid $1.4 million of such deferred payroll tax payments in December 2021. As permitted under the CARES Act, we expect to pay the remaining $1.4 million deferred U.S. Payroll taxes by December 31, 2022. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated 5-year term loan facility (approximately €90.2 million) and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. In March 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for US dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $200 million to $350 million. As of April 1, 2022, we had $88.7 million term loan and $334.5 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.00% and 0.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75% and 1.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.30% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of April 1, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $155.2 million and $268.0 million, respectively. 37 The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenant s and our compliance therewith as of April 1 , 202 2 : Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.50 2.31 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 10.86 (1) Maximum consolidated leverage ratio shall be increased to 4.00 for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition, as defined in the Fifth Amendment. Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Through April 1, 2022, we have repurchased 185 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $15.5 million under the 2018 Repurchase plan. We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of April 1, 2022. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. No shares have been repurchased under the 2020 Repurchase Plan to date. Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended April 1, 2022 and April 2, 2021 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 1, April 2, 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,347 $ 23,268 Net cash used in investing activities $ (6,821 ) $ (5,468 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (22,029 ) $ (28,935 ) April 1, December 31, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 98,805 $ 117,393 Unused and available funds under the revolving credit facility $ 360,482 $ 348,421 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $11.3 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022, versus $23.3 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended April 1, 2022 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to a $14.9 million increase in inventories driven by increased customer demand and higher critical raw material purchases, and a bonus payout in 2022 of $8.4 million compared to no bonus payout in 2021 as a result of the elimination of our 2020 annual bonus plan, partially offset by an increase in profit before tax from higher revenue and gross profit margin expansion. 38 Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended April 2, 2021 was positively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.7 at December 31, 2020 to 4.1 at April 2, 2021 and an increase in our days payables outstanding which increased from 45 days at December 31, 2020 to 51 days at April 2, 2021, offset by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased revenue. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $6.8 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $6.3 million and a contingent consideration payment of $1.5 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. Cash used in investing activities was $5.5 million for the three months ended April 2, 2021, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $3.3 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.2 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $25 million to $30 million in fiscal 2022 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $22.0 million for the three months ended April 1, 2022, primarily due to $11.6 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments, $7.7 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, and $2.1 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Fifth Amendment. Cash used in financing activities was $28.9 million for the three months ended April 2, 2021, primarily due to $18.3 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $8.7 million of payment for the purchase of a building under a finance lease, and $1.3 million of term loan repayments. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through April 1, 2022 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of April 1, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 1, 2022. 39 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 40 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, including estimated economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material change to the consolidated financial statements related to these estimates as of and for the nine months ended October 1, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Income Taxes”, including: (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (ii) the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment (or vice-versa); and (iii) the exception for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending the existing guidance. January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 during the first quarter of 2021. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. ASU 2020-04 is elective. The Company does not expect the impact of ASU 2020-04 to be material to its consolidated financial statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2021-08 requires that entities recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. ASU 2021-08 also applies to contract assets or liabilities from other contracts to which the provisions of ASC 606 apply. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 do not affect the accounting for other assets or liabilities that may arise from revenue contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606, such as refund liabilities, or in a business combination, such as customer-related intangible assets and contract-based intangible assets. January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2021-08 on its consolidated financial statements. 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time, as the Company has a right to consideration from a customer, based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Engineering services aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of October 1, 2021 and December 31, 2020, contract liabilities were $ 9.5 million and $ 6.5 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the nine months ended October 1, 2021 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations and acquired contract liabilities of $ 2.0 million from current year acquisitions, partially offset by $ 4.9 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2020. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 16 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 3. Business Combinations On August 30, 2021 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. (“ATI”), an Apex, North Carolina-based leading supplier of intelligent end-of-arm technology solutions to OEMs for advanced industrial and surgical robots for an initial cash purchase price of $ 170.0 million, net of cash acquired, and $ 51.9 million estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration will be payable in 2022 based on a multiple of actual standalone ATI Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The addition of ATI is expected to complement and add intelligent technology solutions to further expand the Company’s position in mission critical robotic applications. ATI will contribute to the Company’s operations and growth within the Precision Motion reportable segment. On August 31, 2021 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. (“SEM”), a Marlborough, Connecticut-based manufacturer of integrated stepper motors and electronic controls for automation equipment for a total purchase price of $ 115.1 million, net of cash acquired, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The addition of SEM is expected to complement and expand the Company’s presence in life science applications and solutions for industrial automation applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. Allocation of Purchase Price The acquisitions of ATI and SEM have been accounted for as business combinations. The purchase price for each acquisition is allocated based upon a valuation of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using a discounted cash flow income approach and a relief from royalty income approach, with estimates and assumptions developed by management. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill for each acquisition. The Company’s estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as a result of additional information obtained with regards to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) ATI Based upon a preliminary valuation, the total purchase price for ATI was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 10,709 Accounts receivable 12,596 Inventories 17,431 Property, plant and equipment 4,195 Intangible assets 52,400 Goodwill 143,851 Deferred tax assets 345 Other assets 11,425 Total assets acquired 252,952 Accounts payable 5,135 Deferred tax liabilities 228 Other liabilities 14,938 Total liabilities assumed 20,301 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 232,651 Less: cash acquired 10,709 Less: contingent consideration 51,900 Initial purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 170,042 The purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Company is in the process of collecting additional information for the valuation of inventories, property plant and equipment, intangible assets, other liabilities, contingent consideration and unrecognized tax benefits. The fair value of intangible assets for ATI is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 19,800 15 years Customer relationships 23,600 15 years Trademarks and trade names 5,600 15 years Backlog 3,400 1 year Total $ 52,400 The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 52.4 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 143.9 million of goodwill. Goodwill amounting to $ 143.4 million is expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) ATI’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) ATI’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of ATI’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of ATI were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on August 31, 2021. ATI contributed revenues of $ 8.7 million and a profit before income taxes of $ 0.8 million to the Company’s operating results for the nine months ended October 1, 2021. ATI’s profit before income taxes for the period from the acquisition date through October 1, 2021 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $ 0.8 million. 10 NOVANTA INC.

As the SEM acquisition was structured as a stock acquisition for income tax purposes, the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) SEM’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) SEM’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of SEM’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of SEM were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on September 1, 2021. SEM contributed revenues of $ 2.4 million and a profit before income taxes of $ 0.1 million to the Company’s operating results for the nine months ended October 1, 2021.

Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, respectively, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per common share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”) noncontrolling interest shareholders, non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units and operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units are included in the weighted average common share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets as of the end of each reporting period. 12 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 1, October 2, October 1, October 2, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 13,603 $ 8,258 $ 36,577 $ 31,865 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,447 35,142 35,366 35,144 Dilutive potential common shares 317 546 405 465 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,764 35,688 35,771 35,609 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 1 — 18 17 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.38 $ 0.23 $ 1.03 $ 0.91 Diluted $ 0.38 $ 0.23 $ 1.02 $ 0.89 For both the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021, 45 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units and 37 thousand operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team, and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders are considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of October 1, 2021. For both the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020, 73 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of October 2, 2020. 6. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. 13 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) Contingent Consideration s On August 30, 2021, the Company acquired ATI. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ATI acquisition, the former shareholders of ATI are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on ATI’s fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement. The contingent consideration will be payable in 2022. The preliminary fair value of the contingent consideration of $ 51.9 million was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Once the fair value of contingent consideration is finalized, subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. There have been no changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration since the date of the acquisition. On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). In March 2021, the Company made the first installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million), which is included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended October 1, 2021. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections as of October 1, 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 3.7 million ($ 4.3 million). There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million ($ 9.0 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 as of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 2.3 million ($ 2.9 million). Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections as of April 2, 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 2.4 million ($ 2.9 million). The Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million) in May 2020 and the second installment payment of € 1.2 million ($ 1.4 million) in May 2021. These installment payments are reported as cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. The Company made the first installment payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million) in February 2020 and the second installment payment of € 1.8 million ($ 2.2 million) in February 2021. These installment payments are reported as cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021. 14 NOVANTA INC.

See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt. 7. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of October 1, 2021, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 48.3 million and a net gain of $ 0.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 28.5 million and a net gain of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net gain of $ 0.3 million and $ 0.9 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021, respectively, and an aggregate net gain of $ 1.0 million and $ 1.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. 16 NOVANTA INC.

The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through December 2024 . The Company made principal payments of € 3.4 million ($ 4.0 million) towards its term loan and $ 20.0 million towards its revolving credit facility during the nine months ended October 1, 2021.

Fair Value of Debt As of October 1, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 11. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2021 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms.

Preferred and Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Preferred Shares In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares, fix the rights, preferences and designation, as deemed necessary or advisable, relating to the preferred shares, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share . As of October 1, 2021, no preferred shares had been issued and outstanding. Common Share Repurchases In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. As of October 1, 2021, the Company had $ 59.5 million available for future share repurchases under these share repurchase plans. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 1, October 2, October 1, October 2, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Selling, general and administrative $ 4,360 $ 4,265 $ 13,123 $ 10,225 Research and development and engineering 534 1,150 1,776 2,204 Cost of revenue 631 1,589 2,305 3,185 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs 2,965 221 2,965 458 Total share-based compensation expense $ 8,490 $ 7,225 $ 20,169 $ 16,072 Share-based compensation expense reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.0 million during the nine months ended October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, respectively. On May 13, 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan, which increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan from 4,398,613 shares to 6,148,613 shares, extended the term of the plan through May 13, 2031, and included certain provisions that reflect good corporate governance practices. 22 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 91 thousand and 162 thousand DSUs outstanding as of October 1, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Outstanding DSUs are included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended October 1, 2021: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2020 625 $ 58.79 Granted 169 $ 136.85 Vested ( 485 ) $ 51.21 Forfeited ( 20 ) $ 103.20 Unvested at October 1, 2021 289 $ 113.94 Expected to vest as of October 1, 2021 272 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the nine months ended October 1, 2021 was $ 68.0 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of annual performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte Carlo valuation method as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. In February 2021, the Company granted operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”) to certain members of the executive management team. Upon completion of the requisite service periods, the OCF-PSUs will vest in two tranches if the Company achieves the cumulative operating cash flow performance target for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 as approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee as of the date of grant. The first fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the end of the four-year service period from the date of grant and the remaining fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the 23 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) end of the five-year service period from the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period based on the expectation that 100 percent of the OCF-PSUs are deemed probable of vesting. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended October 1, 2021: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2020 142 $ 88.99 Granted 67 $ 150.89 Performance adjustment 28 $ 67.72 Vested ( 75 ) $ 64.25 Forfeited — $ — Unvested at October 1, 2021 162 $ 122.26 Expected to vest as of October 1, 2021 177 The unvested PSUs are shown at target in the table above. As of October 1, 2021, the maximum number of common shares to be earned under these PSU grants was approximately 286 thousand shares. The performance adjustment shares and vested shares shown in the table above are for performance-based awards granted on February 22, 2018. These awards vested at 160 % of target number of common shares during the nine months ended October 1, 2021 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions during the performance period of fiscal years 2018 through 2020. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the nine months ended October 1, 2021 was $ 9.3 million based on the market price of the underlying common shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method with the following assumptions: Nine Months Ended October 1, 2021 Grant-date stock price $ 138.23 Expected volatility 42.44 % Risk-free interest rate 0.22 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 166.64 Stock Options No stock options were granted during the nine months ended October 1, 2021. There were 60 thousand fully-vested stock options outstanding as of October 1, 2021. 13. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the changes are determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. 24 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of adding a new or additional valuation allowance or releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. The Company’s effective tax rate of ( 0.6 %) for the three months ended October 1, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances. The Company’s effective tax rate of 2.0 % for the nine months ended October 1, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, a release of uncertain tax position reserves, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the U.K. corporate tax rate change and an increase in valuation allowances during the period. For the nine months ended October 1, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 14.5 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of 17.6 % for the three months ended October 2, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. The Company’s effective tax rate of 5.2 % for the nine months ended October 2, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in Canada. For the nine months ended October 2, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and the valuation allowance release had a benefit of 7.9 % and 3.3 %, respectively, on the Company’s effective tax rate. 14. Restructuring, Acquisition, and Related Costs The following table summarizes restructuring, acquisition, and related costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 1, October 2, October 1, October 2, 2021 2020 2021 2020 2020 restructuring $ 5,185 $ 1,006 $ 7,688 $ 1,006 2019 restructuring — 68 208 667 2018 restructuring — — — 754 Total restructuring charges $ 5,185 $ 1,074 $ 7,896 $ 2,427 Acquisition and related charges 2,935 613 8,589 3,164 Total restructuring, acquisition, and related costs $ 8,120 $ 1,687 $ 16,485 $ 5,591 2020 Restructuring As a result of the Company’s ongoing evaluations and efforts to reduce its operating costs, while improving efficiency and effectiveness, the Company initiated the 2020 restructuring program in the third quarter of 2020. This program is focused on reducing operating complexity in the Company, including reducing infrastructure costs and streamlining the Company’s operating model to better serve its customers. In addition, the program will be focused on cost reduction actions that improve gross margins for the overall company. During the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021, the Company recorded $ 5.2 million and $ 7.7 million, respectively, in severance and other costs in connection with the 2020 restructuring program. As of October 1, 2021, the Company 25 NOVANTA INC.

As of October 2, 2021, the Company incurred cumulative costs related to this restructuring plan totaling $ 9.0 million. The 2019 restructuring program was completed in the first quarter of 2021. Rollforward of Accrued Expenses Related to Restructuring The following table summarizes the accrual activities, by component, related to the Company’s restructuring plans recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (in thousands): Total Severance Facility Other Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 1,800 $ 1,681 $ 116 $ 3 Restructuring charges 7,896 6,292 1,183 421 Cash payments ( 2,333 ) ( 1,837 ) ( 215 ) ( 281 ) Non-cash charges and other adjustments (1) ( 3,486 ) ( 2,981 ) ( 505 ) — Balance at October 1, 2021 $ 3,877 $ 3,155 $ 579 $ 143 (1) Non-cash charges included stock compensation charges amounting to $ 3.0 million associated with severance agreements for certain employees. Acquisition and Related Charges Acquisition costs in connection with business combinations, including finders’ fees, legal, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees, totaled $ 2.9 million and $ 4.7 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021, respectively, and less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020, respectively. The Company incurred $ 0.1 million and $ 1.9 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021, respectively, and $ 0.4 million and $ 1.0 million for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020, respectively, in legal costs related to a dispute involving a company that was acquired in 2019. Acquisition and related costs recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions totaled less than ($ 0.1 ) million and $ 1.9 million for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2021, respectively, and $ 0.2 million and $ 2.0 million for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020, respectively.

The majority of acquisition and related costs for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020 were included in the Company’s Precision Motion and Vision reportable segments. 26 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) 15. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments Excluding ATI’s purchase commitments, there have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2020. As of October 1, 2021, ATI had noncancellable commitments of $ 17.9 million, primarily related to inventory purchases. The majority of these purchase commitments are expected to be incurred within the next twelve months. Legal Contingencies In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before Novanta acquired it. The arbitration demand alleged breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant sought compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. During the second quarter of 2021, the arbitrator formally closed the arbitration pursuant to a settlement between the parties. No financial damages payments were made by the Company. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the potential loss or a range of potential losses, if such an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 16. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to 27 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021 (Unaudited) its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines.

The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the nine months ended October 1, 2021, the medical market accounted for approximately 53% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the nine months ended October 1, 2021, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 47% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial 32 condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market . Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing components and sub-systems to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Acquisition of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. On August 30, 2021, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. (“ATI”), an Apex, North Carolina-based leading supplier of intelligent end-of-arm technology solutions to OEMs for advanced industrial and surgical robots for an initial cash purchase price of $170.0 million, net of cash acquired, and $51.9 million estimated fair value of contingent consideration.

We expect that the addition of SEM will complement and expand our presence in life science applications and solutions for industrial automation applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. 33 Impact of COVID-19 on O ur Business In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our major facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We have provided frequent employee communications that include guidance and updates to our employees with regards to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in our facilities to perform their work, reducing travel, spreading production over more shifts, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present in our facilities. We expect to continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment and weekly testing of employees for COVID-19 at certain locations. We expect such costs to continue to be significant to our cost of operations. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially or fully, reopen, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with COVID-19 may continue to affect customer demand and restrictions may resume. Through October 1, 2021, we experienced some disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent electronics and other material shortages. We regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain. Disruptions to our suppliers or sub-suppliers caused by these events could cause further challenges in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the electronics and other material shortages, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our designs to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising quality, performance or other requirements and taking other actions to ensure our supply of raw materials. Despite of our mitigation actions, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key part or component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs, and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the recent electronics and other material shortages have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for certain of our parts and primary raw materials as well as increases in the costs of freight, packaging, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. 34 Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended October 1, 2021 Compared with the Three and Nine Months Ended October 2, 2020 The following table sets forth our unaudited results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 1, October 2, October 1, October 2, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 57.1 58.6 57.2 58.9 Gross profit 42.9 41.4 42.8 41.1 Operating expenses: Research and development and engineering 9.8 10.7 10.5 10.2 Selling, general and administrative 17.6 18.7 18.5 18.6 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 2.3 2.5 2.2 2.3 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs 4.6 1.2 3.2 1.3 Total operating expenses 34.3 33.1 34.5 32.4 Operating income 8.6 8.3 8.3 8.8 Interest income (expense), net (1.0 ) (1.2 ) (0.9 ) (1.1 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net 0.0 (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (0.0 ) Other income (expense), net (0.0 ) (0.0 ) (0.0 ) 0.0 Income before income taxes 7.6 7.0 7.4 7.6 Income tax provision (benefit) (0.0 ) 1.2 0.1 0.4 Consolidated net income 7.7 % 5.8 % 7.2 % 7.2 % Overview of Financial Results Total revenue of $177.7 million for the three months ended October 1, 2021 increased $34.8 million, or 24.3%, from the prior year period primarily due to increased demand in the advanced industrial market related to microelectronics and as a result of increases in industrial manufacturing spending as compared to the 2020 period, which was impacted by COVID-19, as well as revenue from current year acquisitions.

Net interest expense was $4.5 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2021, versus $5.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities.

Income Tax Provision (Benefit) Our effective tax rate for the three months ended October 1, 2021 was (0.6%), versus 17.6% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of (0.6%) for the three months ended October 1, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and a release of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of statutes of limitation, partially offset by an increase in our valuation allowance. 40 Our effective tax rate of 17.6 % for the three months ended October 2 , 202 0 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 1, 2021 was 2.0%, versus 5.2% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 2.0% for the nine months ended October 1, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, a release of uncertain tax positions reserves, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the U.K. corporate tax rate change during the period and an increase in our valuation allowances. For the nine months ended October 1, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 14.5% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of 5.2% for the nine months ended October 2, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in Canada. For the nine months ended October 2, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and the release of the valuation allowance had a benefit of 7.9% and 3.3%, respectively, on our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides a potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $200.0 million by exercising the accordion feature under our revolving credit agreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside our control, such as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening supply chain disruptions and electronics and material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that the applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of October 1, 2021, $69.0 million of our $102.4 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below). Approximately $171.6 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. We deferred certain U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. As of October 1, 2021, we had $2.8 million in such deferred U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. As permitted under the CARES Act, we expect to pay half of the deferred U.S. payroll tax payments by December 31, 2021 and the remaining half by December 31, 2022. 41 In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors may designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares in order to raise additional capital . As of October 1 , 2021, no preferred shares ha d been issued and outstanding. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated 5-year term loan facility (approximately €90.2 million) and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. In March 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. As of October 1, 2021, we had $95.3 million term loan and $355.3 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25% and 1.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of October 1, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $171.6 million and $279.0 million, respectively. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion feature. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of October 1, 2021: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 2.64 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 13.23 Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to 42 Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of October 1 , 202 1 . In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. No shares have been repurchased under the 2020 Repurchase Plan to date. Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Nine Months Ended October 1, October 2, 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 65,912 $ 93,686 Net cash used in investing activities $ (302,140 ) $ (9,796 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 214,290 $ (57,195 ) October 1, December 31, 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 102,395 $ 125,054 Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility $ 139,712 $ 395,239 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $65.9 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2021, versus $93.7 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 1, 2021 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories due to increases in revenue and demand, and the $8.3 million payout of an acquisition earnout recorded as compensation, partially offset by an increase in days payables outstanding and substantially no bonus payout in 2021 as a result of the elimination of our 2020 annual bonus plan. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 2, 2020 was positively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.1 at December 31, 2019 to 3.3 at October 2, 2020 and a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 53 days at December 31, 2019 to 44 days at October 2, 2020. During the nine months ended October 2, 2020, we paid the 2019 annual employee bonuses which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2019. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $302.1 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2021, primarily driven by the ATI and SEM acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid cash consideration of $285.2 million (net of cash acquired of $14.6 million) during the nine months ended October 1, 2021. We also paid capital expenditures of $14.8 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.2 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies during the nine months ended October 1, 2021. Cash used in investing activities was $9.8 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2020, primarily related to capital expenditures of $7.2 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.6 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $20 million to $22 million in fiscal 2021 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. Financing Cash Flows Cash provided by financing activities was $214.3 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2021, primarily due to $280.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the cash considerations paid for the ATI and SEM acquisitions, partially offset by $30.7 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $24.0 million of term loan 43 and revolver credit facility repayments, a $8. 7 million payment for the purchase of a building under a finance lease agreement , and $1.8 million of contingent consideration payments related to acquisition s . Cash used in financing activities was $57.2 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2020, primarily due to $34.0 million in repayments of borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, $8.3 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $5.8 million payments of deferred and escrowed purchase price related to prior year acquisitions, $5.5 million of repurchases of common shares, and $1.6 million of fees paid in connection with the First Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, pension obligations, contingent considerations and earn-outs. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the estimated contingent considerations payments and non-cancellable inventory purchase commitments from current year acquisitions, through October 1, 2021, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2020 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through October 1, 2021, we have not entered into any other off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with any unconsolidated entities or other persons. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, including estimated economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material change to the consolidated financial statements related to these estimates as of and for the six months ended July 2, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Income Taxes”, including: (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (ii) the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment (or vice-versa); and (iii) the exception for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending the existing guidance. January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 during the first quarter of 2021. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. ASU 2020-04 is elective. The Company does not expect the impact of ASU 2020-04 to be material to its consolidated financial statements. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time, as the Company has a right to consideration from a customer, based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Professional services aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of July 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, contract liabilities were $ 5.6 million and $ 6.5 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the six months ended July 2, 2021 is primarily due to $ 4.1 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2020, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Loss Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2020 $ ( 12,241 ) $ ( 2,296 ) $ ( 9,945 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 451 ) ( 353 ) ( 98 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 481 — 481 Balance at July 2, 2021 $ ( 12,211 ) $ ( 2,649 ) $ ( 9,562 ) The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 4. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three and six months ended July 2, 2021 and July 3, 2020, respectively, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per common share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”) noncontrolling interest shareholders, non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units and operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units are included in the weighted average common share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets as of the end of each reporting period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 2, July 3, July 2, July 3, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 11,664 $ 11,660 $ 22,974 $ 23,607 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,374 35,137 35,326 35,145 Dilutive potential common shares 389 442 449 425 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,763 35,579 35,775 35,570 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 25 — 23 26 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.33 $ 0.33 $ 0.65 $ 0.67 Diluted $ 0.33 $ 0.33 $ 0.64 $ 0.66 For both the three and six months ended July 2, 2021, 46 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units and 37 thousand operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team, and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) share holders are considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of July 2, 202 1 . For both the three and six months ended July 3, 2020, 71 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of July 3, 2020. 5. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). In March 2021, the Company made the first installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million), which is included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended July 2, 2021. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three and six months ended July 2, 2021. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million ($ 9.0 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring , acquisition , and related costs until the liability is fully settled. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 as of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 2.3 million ($ 2.9 million). Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections as of April 2, 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 2.4 million ($ 2.9 million). The Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million) in May 2020 and the second installment payment of €1.2 million ($ 1.4 million) in May 2021. These installment payments are reported as cash flows from financing activities in the consolidate d statement of cash flows for the respective periods . There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three and six months ended July 2, 2021. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. The Company made the first installment payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million) in February 2020 and the second installment payment of € 1.8 million ($ 2.2 million) in February 2021. These installment payments are reported as cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three and six months ended July 2, 2021.

Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of July 2, 2021, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 27.5 million and a net gain of $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 28.5 million and a net gain of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net loss of $ 0.1 million and an aggregate net gain of $ 0.6 million for the three and six months ended July 2, 2021, respectively, and an aggregate net gain of $ 0.7 million and $ 0.4 million for the three and six months ended July 3, 2020, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021 and noted no impairment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) Senior Credit Facilities On December 31, 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) with existing lenders for an aggregate credit facility of $ 450.0 million, consisting of a $ 100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately € 90.2 million) 5 -year term loan facility and a $ 350.0 million 5 -year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and includes an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through December 2024 . The Company repaid € 2.3 million ($ 2.7 million) of its term loan during the six months ended July 2, 2021. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of July 2, 2021. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. Fair Value of Debt As of July 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 10. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2021 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms. 16 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 2, July 3, July 2, July 3, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Selling, general and administrative $ 3,834 $ 3,162 $ 8,763 $ 5,960 Research and development and engineering 515 861 1,242 1,054 Cost of revenue 686 1,388 1,674 1,596 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs — 237 — 237 Total share-based compensation expense $ 5,035 $ 5,648 $ 11,679 $ 8,847 Share-based compensation expense reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 1.1 million and $ 1.0 million during the six months ended July 2, 2021 and July 3, 2020, respectively. On May 13, 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan, which increases the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan from 4,398,613 shares to 6,148,613 shares, extends the term of the plan through May 13, 2031, and includes certain provisions that reflect good corporate governance practices. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 91 thousand and 162 thousand DSUs outstanding as of July 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Outstanding DSUs are included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended July 2, 2021: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2020 625 $ 58.79 Granted 165 $ 136.60 Vested ( 286 ) $ 75.12 Forfeited ( 12 ) $ 98.78 Unvested at July 2, 2021 492 $ 74.34 Expected to vest as of July 2, 2021 469 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the six months ended July 2, 2021 was $ 40.3 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of annual performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. In February 2021, the Company granted operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”) to certain members of the executive management team. Upon completion of the requisite service periods, the OCF-PSUs will vest in two tranches if the Company achieves the cumulative operating cash flow performance target for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 as approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee as of the date of grant. The first fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the end of the four-year service period from the date of grant and the remaining fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the end of the five-year service period from the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period based on the expectation that 100 percent of the OCF-PSUs are deemed probable of vesting. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended July 2, 2021: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2020 142 $ 88.99 Granted 67 $ 150.89 Performance adjustment 28 $ 67.72 Vested ( 75 ) $ 64.25 Forfeited — $ — Unvested at July 2, 2021 162 $ 122.26 Expected to vest as of July 2, 2021 137 The unvested PSUs are shown at target in the table above. As of July 2, 2021, the maximum number of shares to be earned under these PSU grants was approximately 286 thousand shares. The performance adjustment shares and vested shares shown in the table above are for performance-based awards granted on February 22, 2018. These awards vested at 160 % of target number of shares during the six months ended July 2, 2021 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions during the performance period of fiscal years 2018 through 2020. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the six months ended July 2, 2021 was $ 9.3 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Six Months Ended July 2, 2021 Grant-date stock price $ 138.23 Expected volatility 42.44 % Risk-free interest rate 0.22 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 166.64 Stock Options No stock options were granted during the six months ended July 2, 2021. There were 60 thousand fully-vested stock options outstanding as of July 2, 2021. 12. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. The Company’s effective tax rate of 19.2 % for the three months ended July 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and a release of uncertain tax position reserves, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the UK corporate tax rate change. The Company’s effective tax rate of 3.5 % for the six months ended July 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, a release of uncertain tax position reserves, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the UK corporate tax rate change during the period. For the six months ended July 2, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 14.7 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of 0.3 % for the three months ended July 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance. For the three months ended July 3, 2020, the valuation allowance release had a benefit of 11.4 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of ( 0 %) for the six months ended July 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance. For the six months ended July 3, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and the valuation allowance release had a benefit of 11.2 % and 5.7 %, respectively, on the Company’s effective tax rate. 21 NOVANTA INC.

This program is focused on reducing operating complexity in the Company, including reducing infrastructure costs and streamlining the Company’s operating model to better serve its customers. In addition, the program will be focused on cost reduction actions that improve gross margins for the overall company. During the three and six months ended July 2, 2021, the Company recorded $ 1.2 million and $ 2.5 million, respectively, in severance and other costs in connection with the 2020 restructuring program. As of July 2, 2021, the Company had incurred cumulative costs related to this restructuring plan totaling $ 5.2 million. The Company anticipates substantially completing the 2020 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expects to incur additional restructuring charges of $ 3.0 million to $ 4.0 million related to the 2020 restructuring program in the next twelve months.

During the three and six months ended July 2, 2021, the Company incurred $ 0.8 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, in legal costs related to a dispute involving a company that was acquired in 2019. Acquisition and related costs recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions totaled $ 0.9 million and $ 1.9 million for the three and six months ended July 2, 2021, respectively, and $ 0.9 million and $ 1.8 million for the three and six months ended July 3, 2020, respectively. The majority of acquisition and related costs for the three and six months ended July 2, 2021 were included in the Company’s Precision Motion, Vision and Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services reportable segments. The majority of acquisition and related costs for the three and six months ended July 3, 2020 were included in the Company’s Precision Motion and Vision reportable segments. 14. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2020. Legal Contingencies In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before Novanta acquired it. The arbitration demand alleges breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant sought compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. During the three months ended July 2, 2021, the arbitrator formally closed the arbitration pursuant to a settlement between the parties. No financial damages payments were made by the Company. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 23 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 2, 2021 (Unaudited) Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 15. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers. Based upon the information provided to the CODM, the Company has determined that it operates in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics The Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Vision The Vision segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless, recorder and video integration technologies for operating room integrations; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies; and embedded touch screen solutions.

Business Overview We are a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. Reportable Segments We operate in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics Our Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Vision Our Vision segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless, recorder and video integration technologies for operating room integrations; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies, and embedded touch screen solutions. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Precision Motion Our Precision Motion segment designs, manufactures and markets optical and inductive encoders, precision motor and motion control sub-assemblies, servo drives, air bearings, and air bearing spindles to customers worldwide. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the six months ended July 2, 2021, the medical market accounted for approximately 53% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the six months ended July 2, 2021, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 47% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, financial 28 condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market . Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing components and sub-systems to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We have provided frequent employee communications that include guidance and updates to our employees with regards to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in our facilities to perform their work, reducing travel, spreading production over more shifts, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present in our facilities. We expect to continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment and weekly testing of unvaccinated employees for COVID-19 at certain locations. We expect such costs to continue to be significant to our cost of operations. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The spread of COVID-19 caused a global economic slowdown and a global recession. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially or fully, reopen, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with COVID-19 may continue to affect customer demand and restrictions may resume. 29 Through July 2, 2021, w e experienced limited dis ruption s to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. W e regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain . Disruption s to our suppliers or sub-suppliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent electronics and other material shortages could cause further challenges in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the electronics and other material shortages, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our designs to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising quality, performance or other requirements, and taking other actions to ensure our supply of raw materials. Although we are working to mitigate potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the electronics and other material shortages, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key part or component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. COVID-19 has caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for certain of our parts and primary raw materials as well as increases in the costs of freight, packaging, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs.

The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $9.2 million, partially offset by an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $1.5 million, and R&D spending of $1.3 million. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition costs. These costs for the three months ended July 2, 2021 increased by $9.3 million versus the prior year period primarily due to costs related to COVID-19 testing for employees of $1.5 million included in costs of revenue, an increase in SG&A spending of $5.7 million primarily related to share-based compensation and the re-establishment of 2021 bonuses, and an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $1.6 million. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for the six months ended July 2, 2021 increased by $13.5 million versus the prior year period primarily due to costs related to COVID-19 testing for employees of $2.9 million included in costs of revenue, an increase in SG&A spending of $8.1 million primarily related to share-based compensation and the re-establishment of 2021 bonuses, and an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $1.8 million. Other Income and Expense Items The following table sets forth other income and expense items for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 2, July 3, July 2, July 3, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Interest income (expense), net $ (1,378 ) $ (1,701 ) $ (2,786 ) $ (3,379 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net $ (76 ) $ (282 ) $ (333 ) $ (28 ) Other income (expense), net $ (97 ) $ (22 ) $ (167 ) $ 61 Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $1.4 million for the three months ended July 2, 2021, versus $1.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 2.04% during the three months ended July 2, 2021, versus 2.40% during the three months ended July 3, 2020. Net interest expense was $2.8 million for the six months ended July 2, 2021, versus $3.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 2.03% during the six months ended July 2, 2021, versus 2.40% during the six months ended July 3, 2020. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $(0.1) million net losses for the three months ended July 2, 2021, versus $(0.3) million net losses in the prior year period. 35 Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $ (0. 3 ) million net losses for the six months ended July 2, 2021 , versus less than $(0.1) million net losses in the prior year period . The increase in net losses was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and the Euro and lower net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal for both the three and six months ended July 2, 2021 and the three and six months ended July 3, 2020. Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rate for the three months ended July 2, 2021 was 19.2%, versus 0.3% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 19.2% for the three months ended July 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and a release of uncertain tax position reserves, offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the UK corporate tax rate change. Our effective tax rate of 0.3% for the three months ended July 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in Canada. For the three months ended July 3, 2020, the release of the valuation allowance had a benefit of 11.4% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended July 2, 2021 was 3.5%, versus (0%) for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 3.5% for the six months ended July 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, a release of uncertain tax positions reserves, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards, partially offset by the revaluation of long term deferred tax balances resulting from the UK corporate tax rate change during the period. For the six months ended July 2, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 14.7% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of (0%) for the six months ended July 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance. For the six months ended July 3, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and the release of the valuation allowance had a benefit of 11.2% and 5.7%, respectively, on our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides a sufficient source of liquidity to pay the purchase prices for our pending acquisitions of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. and Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. as well as a potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $200.0 million by exercising the accordion feature under our revolving credit agreement. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside our control, such as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes 36 in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 20 20 . Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that the applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of July 2, 2021, $87.8 million of our $133.9 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below). Approximately $177.1 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. We deferred certain U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. As of July 2, 2021, we had $2.8 million in such deferred U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. As permitted under the CARES Act, we expect to pay half of the deferred U.S. payroll tax payments by December 31, 2021 and the remaining half by December 31, 2022. In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors may designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares in order to raise additional capital. As of July 2, 2021, no preferred shares have been issued and outstanding. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated 5-year term loan facility (approximately €90.2 million) and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. In March 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. As of July 2, 2021, we had $98.9 million term loan and $97.1 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25% and 1.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of July 2, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $177.1 million and $19.0 million, respectively. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of July 2, 2021: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.29 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 11.20 37 Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of July 2, 2021. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. No shares have been repurchased under the 2020 Repurchase Plan to date. Pending Acquisitions On July 9, 2021, we signed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. (“SEM”), a Marlborough, Connecticut-based manufacturer of integrated stepper motors and electronic controls for automation equipment for a total purchase price of $115 million in cash, subject to customary closing and net working capital adjustments. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is anticipated to close in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. SEM will be included in our Precision Motion reportable segment. On July 18, 2021, we signed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire ATI Industrial Automation Inc. (“ATI”), an Apex, North Carolina-based developer and manufacturer of robotic end-of-arm tooling for an initial purchase price of $172 million upfront in cash and additional contingent cash payments associated with 2021 financial performance. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is anticipated to close in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. ATI will be included in our Precision Motion reportable segment. We expect to fund the SEM and ATI acquisitions using cash on hand and funds from drawdowns under our Senior Credit Facilities. Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended July 2, 2021 and July 3, 2020 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Six Months Ended July 2, July 3, 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 52,014 $ 51,572 Net cash used in investing activities $ (10,843 ) $ (7,272 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (31,994 ) $ (24,978 ) July 2, December 31, 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 133,853 $ 125,054 Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility $ 397,893 $ 395,239 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $52.0 million for the six months ended July 2, 2021, versus $51.6 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended July 2, 2021 increased from the prior year period primarily 38 due to an increase in our days payables outstanding which increased from 45 days at December 31, 2020 to 52 days at July 2, 2021 and substantially no bonus payout in 2021 as a result of the elimination of our 2020 annual bonus plan, offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory due to increases in revenue and demand . Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended July 3, 2020 was positively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.1 at December 31, 2019 to 3.2 at July 3, 2020 and a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 53 days at December 31, 2019 to 49 days at July 3, 2020. During the six months ended July 3, 2020, we paid the 2019 annual employee bonuses which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2019. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $10.8 million for the six months ended July 2, 2021, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $8.6 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.2 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. Cash used in investing activities was $7.3 million for the six months ended July 3, 2020, primarily related to capital expenditures of $4.6 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.6 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $21 million to $23 million in fiscal 2021 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $32.0 million for the six months ended July 2, 2021, primarily due to $18.4 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, a $8.7 million payment for the purchase of a building under a finance lease agreement, $2.7 million of term loan repayments, and $1.8 million of contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions. Cash used in financing activities was $25.0 million for the six months ended July 3, 2020, primarily due to $7.9 million of payroll tax payments on share-based compensation awards, $5.6 million of ARGES deferred purchase price payment, $5.5 million of repurchases of common shares, $2.5 million repayment of our term loan, and $1.6 million of fees paid in connection with the First Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, pension obligations, contingent considerations and earn-outs. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. As of July 2, 2021, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2020 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through July 2, 2021, we have not entered into any other off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with any unconsolidated entities or other persons. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through July 2, 2021 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. 39 Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity. During the three months ended July 2, 2021, there have been no material changes to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of July 2, 2021, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 2, 2021. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended July 2, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 40 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before Novanta acquired it. The arbitration demand alleges breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant sought compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. During the three months ended July 2, 2021, the arbitrator formally closed the arbitration pursuant to a settlement between the parties. No financial damages payments were made by the Company. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. There have been no material changes in our risk factors as included in our Annual Report. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3.

This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, including estimated economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material change to the consolidated financial statements related to these estimates as of and for the three months ended April 2, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Income Taxes”, including: (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (ii) the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment (or vice-versa); and (iii) the exception for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending the existing guidance. January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. ASU 2020-04 is elective. The Company does not expect the impact of ASU 2020-04 to be material to its consolidated financial statements. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time, as the Company has a right to consideration from a customer, based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Professional services aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of April 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, contract liabilities were $ 5.6 million and $ 6.5 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the three months ended April 2, 2021 is primarily due to $ 2.8 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2020, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 15 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Loss Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2020 $ ( 12,241 ) $ ( 2,296 ) $ ( 9,945 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 609 ) ( 489 ) ( 120 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 241 — 241 Balance at April 2, 2021 $ ( 12,609 ) $ ( 2,785 ) $ ( 9,824 ) The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 4. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three months ended April 2, 2021 and April 3, 2020, respectively, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per common share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”) noncontrolling interest shareholders, non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units and operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units are included in the weighted average common share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets as of the end of each reporting period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended April 2, April 3, 2021 2020 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 11,310 $ 11,947 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,279 35,152 Dilutive potential common shares 510 409 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,789 35,561 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 27 52 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.32 $ 0.34 Diluted $ 0.32 $ 0.34 For the three months ended April 2, 2021, 46 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units and 37 thousand operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team, and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders are 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of April 2, 202 1 . For the three months ended April 3, 2020, 71 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of April 3, 2020. 5. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. In March 2021, the Company made the first installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million), which is included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended April 2, 2021. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three months ended April 2, 2021. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million ($ 9.0 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) operations in restructuring , acquisition , and related costs until the liability is fully settled. Based on the revenue performance as of April 2, 2021 and the most recent revenue projections for fiscal years 2021 and 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 2.4 million ($ 2.9 million) as of April 2, 2021 . The Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million) during the three months ended July 3, 2020. The Company is expected to make a second installment payment of € 1.3 million ($ 1.5 million) during the three months ended July 2, 2021. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. The Company made the first installment payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million) during the three months ended April 3, 2020. In February 2021, the Company made the second installment payment of € 1.8 million ($ 2.2 million), which is included in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended April 2, 2021. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three months ended April 2, 2021.

Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of April 2, 2021, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 23.6 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 28.5 million and a net gain of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net gain of $ 0.7 million and an aggregate net loss of $ 0.3 million for the three months ended April 2, 2021 and April 3, 2020, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and noted no impairment.

The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and includes an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through December 2024 . The Company repaid € 1.1 million ($ 1.3 million) of its term loan during the three months ended April 2, 2021. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of April 2, 2021. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. Fair Value of Debt As of April 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 16 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) 10. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2021 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms. The following table summarizes the components of lease costs (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, April 3, 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 1,831 $ 2,037 Finance lease cost Amortization of right-of-use assets 150 248 Interest on lease liabilities 87 110 Variable lease cost 235 379 Total lease cost $ 2,303 $ 2,774 The following table provides additional details of balance sheet information related to the Company’s leases (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate): April 2, December 31, 2021 2020 Operating leases Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 31,642 $ 34,444 Current portion of operating lease liabilities $ 5,895 $ 6,188 Operating lease liabilities 30,934 32,802 Total operating lease liabilities $ 36,829 $ 38,990 Finance leases Property, plant and equipment, gross $ 9,583 $ 19,819 Accumulated depreciation ( 4,617 ) ( 4,934 ) Finance lease assets included in property, plant and equipment, net $ 4,966 $ 14,885 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 574 $ 9,720 Other liabilities 5,760 5,908 Total finance lease liabilities $ 6,334 $ 15,628 Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) Operating leases 9.4 9.3 Finance leases 8.3 3.5 Weighted-average discount rate Operating leases 5.49 % 5.50 % Finance leases 5.54 % 3.00 % 17 NOVANTA INC.

Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Common Share Repurchases In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. As of April 2, 2021, the Company had $ 59.5 million available for future share repurchases under the 2018 and 2020 Share Repurchase Plans. 18 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, April 3, 2021 2020 Selling, general and administrative $ 4,929 $ 2,798 Research and development and engineering 727 193 Cost of revenue 988 208 Total share-based compensation expense $ 6,644 $ 3,199 Share-based compensation expense reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 1.1 million and $ 0.9 million during the three months ended April 2, 2021 and April 3, 2020, respectively. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 171 thousand and 162 thousand DSUs outstanding as of April 2, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended April 2, 2021: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2020 625 $ 58.79 Granted 91 $ 130.76 Vested ( 283 ) $ 75.06 Forfeited ( 4 ) $ 88.18 Unvested at April 2, 2021 429 $ 63.05 Expected to vest as of April 2, 2021 405 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the three months ended April 2, 2021 was $ 39.9 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. In February 2021, the Company granted operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”) to certain members of the executive management team. Upon completion of the requisite service periods, the OCF-PSUs will vest in two tranches if the Company achieves the cumulative operating cash flow performance target for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 as approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee as of the date of grant. The first fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the end of the four-year service period from the date of grant and the remaining fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the end of the five-year service period from the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period based on the expectation that 100 percent of the OCF-PSUs are deemed probable of vesting. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended April 2, 2021: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2020 142 $ 88.99 Granted 67 $ 150.89 Performance adjustment 28 $ 67.72 Vested ( 75 ) $ 64.25 Forfeited — $ — Unvested at April 2, 2021 162 $ 122.26 Expected to vest as of April 2, 2021 136 The unvested PSUs are shown at target in the table above. As of April 2, 2021, the maximum number of shares to be earned under these PSU grants was approximately 286 thousand shares. The performance adjustment shares and vested shares shown in the table above are for performance-based awards granted on February 22, 2018. These awards vested at 160 % of target number of shares during the three months ended April 2, 2021 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions during the performance period of fiscal years 2018 through 2020. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the three months ended April 2, 2021 was $ 9.3 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Three Months Ended April 2, 2021 Grant-date stock price $ 138.23 Expected volatility 42.44 % Risk-free interest rate 0.22 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 166.64 Stock Options No stock options were granted during the three months ended April 2, 2021. There were 60 thousand fully-vested stock options outstanding as of April 2, 2021. 12. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. The Company’s effective tax rate of ( 20.8 )% for the three months ended April 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended April 2, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 35.9 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of ( 0.3 )% for the three months ended April 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended April 3, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 19.8 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. 21 NOVANTA INC.

This program is focused on reducing operating complexity in the Company, including reducing infrastructure costs and streamlining the Company’s operating model to better serve its customers. In addition, the program will be focused on cost reduction actions that improve gross margins for the overall company. During the three months ended April 2, 2021, the Company recorded $ 1.3 million in severance and other costs in connection with the 2020 restructuring program. As of April 2, 2021, the Company had incurred cumulative costs related to this restructuring plan totaling $ 4.1 million. The Company anticipates substantially completing the 2020 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expects to incur additional restructuring charges of $ 6.0 million to $ 7.0 million related to the 2020 restructuring program in the next twelve months. The following table summarizes restructuring costs associated with the 2020 restructuring program by reportable segment (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, April 3, 2021 2020 Photonics $ 295 $ — Vision 422 — Precision Motion 621 — Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services — — Total $ 1,338 $ — 2019 Restructuring During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company implemented a restructuring plan intended to realign operations, reduce costs, achieve operational efficiencies and focus resources on growth initiatives (the “2019 restructuring plan”).

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2020. Legal Contingencies In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before Novanta acquired it. The arbitration demand alleges breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and no amount has been accrued for in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 23 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 2, 2021 (Unaudited) Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 15.

Business Overview We are a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. Reportable Segments We operate in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics Our Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures.

The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the three months ended April 2, 2021, the medical market accounted for approximately 55% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the three months ended April 2, 2021, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 45% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial 28 condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market . Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing components and sub-systems to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We have provided frequent employee communications that include guidance and updates to our employees with regards to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, requiring working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in our facilities to perform their work, suspending travel, spreading production over more shifts, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present in our facilities. We expect to continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment and weekly testing for COVID-19 at certain locations. We expect such costs to continue to be significant to our cost of operations. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The spread of COVID-19 has caused a global economic slowdown and a global recession. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially or fully, reopen, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with COVID-19 may continue to affect customer demand. 29 Through April 2, 2021, w e experienced limited dis ruption s to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. W e regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain . Disruption s on our suppliers or sub-suppliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent electronics and other material shortages could cause further challenges in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and electronics and other material shortages, we are identifying alternative suppliers, sourcing raw materials from different supplier locations, modifying our designs to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising quality or performance, and taking other actions to ensure our supply of raw materials. Although we are mitigating potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and electronics and other material shortages, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key part or component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. COVID-19 has caused inflation pressures on the market prices for certain of our primary raw materials as well as increases in the costs of freight, packaging, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs. Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended April 2, 2021 Compared with the Three Months Ended April 3, 2020 The following table sets forth our unaudited results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended April 2, April 3, 2021 2020 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 57.7 58.5 Gross profit 42.3 41.5 Operating expenses: Research and development and engineering 11.5 9.9 Selling, general and administrative 19.5 19.8 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 2.2 2.2 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs 2.3 1.1 Total operating expenses 35.5 33.0 Operating income 6.8 8.5 Interest income (expense), net (0.9 ) (1.1 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net (0.2 ) 0.2 Other income (expense), net (0.0 ) 0.1 Income before income taxes 5.7 7.7 Income tax provision (1.2 ) (0.0 ) Consolidated net income 6.9 % 7.7 % 30 Overview of Financial Results Total revenue of $162.6 million for the three months ended April 2, 2021 increased $7.1 million, or 4.6%, from the prior year period primarily due to increased demand in the advanced industrial market related to microelectronics and as a result of increases in industrial manufacturing spending, partially offset by a decrease in demand in the medical market as a result of deferrals of elective surgical procedures during COVID-19 pandemic.

R&D expenses were $18.7 million, or 11.5% of revenue, during the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $15.3 million, or 9.9% of revenue, during the prior year period. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to higher compensation related expense as a result of higher headcount and higher R&D project spending. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems, and executive management functions. SG&A expenses were $31.7 million, or 19.5% of revenue, during the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $30.8 million, or 19.8% of revenue, during the prior year period. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense and higher variable compensation expense as a result of re-establishment of 2021 cash bonuses, partially offset by lower travel costs and other discretionary spending. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $3.6 million, or 2.2% of revenue, during the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $3.4 million, or 2.2% of revenue, during the prior year period. Restructuring, Acquisition, and Related Costs We recorded restructuring, acquisition, and related costs of $3.7 million during the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $1.7 million during the prior year period. The increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs versus the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in restructuring cost related to the 2020 restructuring plan and legal fees related to a dispute involving a company we acquired in 2019. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, April 3, 2021 2020 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 12,395 $ 8,915 Vision 3,366 5,634 Precision Motion 7,446 6,538 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (12,108 ) (7,837 ) Total $ 11,099 $ 13,250 33 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $12.4 million, or 21.2% of revenue, during the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $8.9 million, or 16.2% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $3.4 million and a decrease in SG&A spending of $0.9 million, offset by an increase in R&D spending of $0.7 million. Vision Vision segment operating income was $3.4 million, or 5.0% of revenue, during the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $5.6 million, or 8.2% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to an increase in R&D spending of $2.0 million, and an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $1.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A spending of $0.6 million. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $7.4 million, or 20.4% of revenue, during the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $6.5 million, or 20.9% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $2.2 million, partially offset by an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $0.7 million, and R&D spending of $0.6 million. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition costs. These costs for the three months ended April 2, 2021 increased by $4.3 million versus the prior year period primarily due to costs related to COVID-19 testing for employees of $1.4 million included in costs of goods sold, and an increase in SG&A spending of $2.4 million related to stock-based compensation and the re-establishment of 2021 cash bonuses. Other Income and Expense Items The following table sets forth other income and expense items for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, April 3, 2021 2020 Interest income (expense), net $ (1,408 ) $ (1,678 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net $ (257 ) $ 254 Other income (expense), net $ (70 ) $ 83 Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $1.4 million for the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $1.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 2.02% during the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus 2.39% during the three months ended April 3, 2020. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $(0.3) million net losses for the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $0.3 million net gains in the prior year period. The decrease in net gains was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and the Euro and lower net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal for both the three months ended April 2, 2021 and the three months ended April 3, 2021. 34 Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rate for the three months ended April 2, 2021 was (20.8)%, versus (0.3)% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of (20.8)% for the three months ended April 2, 2021 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended April 2, 2021, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 35.9% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of (0.3)% for the three months ended April 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended April 3, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 19.8% on our effective tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside our control, such as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that the applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of April 2, 2021, $87.0 million of our $113.6 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below). Approximately $176.5 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. We deferred certain U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. As of April 2, 2021, we had $2.8 million in such deferred U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. As permitted under the CARES Act, we expect to pay half of the deferred U.S. payroll tax payments by December 31, 2021 and the remaining half by December 31, 2022. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated 5-year term loan facility (approximately €90.2 million) and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. 35 We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. In March 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. As of April 2, 2021, we had $99.2 million term loan and $96.3 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25% and 1.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of April 2, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $176.5 million and $19.0 million, respectively. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of April 2, 2021: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.35 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 10.95 Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of April 2, 2021. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. No shares have been repurchased under the 2020 Repurchase Plan to date. 36 Cash Flows for the T hree M onths Ended April 2, 202 1 and April 3, 2020 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 2, April 3, 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 23,268 $ 17,755 Net cash used in investing activities $ (5,468 ) $ (5,101 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (28,935 ) $ (16,045 ) April 2, December 31, 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 113,562 $ 125,054 Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility $ 398,700 $ 395,239 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $23.3 million for the three months ended April 2, 2021, versus $17.8 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended April 2, 2022 increased from the prior year period primarily due to working capital improvements resulting in an increase in cash flows from inventory and substantially no bonus payout in 2021 as a result of the elimination of our 2020 annual bonus plan, offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to increases in revenue. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended April 2, 2021 was positively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.7 at December 31, 2020 to 4.1 at April 2, 2021 and an increase in our days payables outstanding which increased from 45 days at December 31, 2020 to 51 days at April 2, 2021, offset by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased revenue. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended April 3, 2020 was positively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.1 at December 31, 2019 to 3.2 at April 3, 2020 and a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 53 days at December 31, 2019 to 50 days at April 3, 2020. During the three months ended April 3, 2020, we paid the 2019 annual employee bonuses which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2019. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $5.5 million for the three months ended April 2, 2021, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $3.3 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.2 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. Cash used in investing activities was $5.1 million for the three months ended April 3, 2020, primarily related to capital expenditures of $2.3 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.6 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We have no material commitments to purchase property, plant, and equipment as of April 2, 2021. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $21 million to $23 million in fiscal 2021 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $28.9 million for the three months ended April 2, 2021, primarily due to $18.3 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $8.7 million of payment made for the purchase of a building under a finance lease, and $1.3 million of term loan repayments. Cash used in financing activities was $16.0 million for the three months ended April 3, 2020, primarily due to $1.3 million of term loan repayments, $1.3 million of fees paid in connection with the First Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, $7.8 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, and $5.5 million of repurchases of common shares. 37 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, pension obligations, deferred cash considerations associated with acquisitions, contingent considerations and earn-outs. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. As of April 2, 2021, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2020 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through April 2, 2021, we have not entered into any other off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with any unconsolidated entities or other persons. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through April 2, 2021 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity. During the three months ended April 2, 2021, there have been no material changes to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of April 2, 2021, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 2, 2021. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended April 2, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 38 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before Novanta acquired it. The arbitration demand alleges breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and no amount has been accrued for in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. There have been no material changes in our risk factors as included in our Annual Report. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, including estimated economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material change to the consolidated financial statements related to these estimates as of and for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, including: (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (ii) the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment (or vice-versa); and (iii) the exception for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending the existing guidance. January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses of financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. January 1, 2020. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2020. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. ASU 2020-04 is elective. The Company does not expect the impact of ASU 2020-04 to be material to its consolidated financial statements. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue . Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time, as the Company has a right to consideration from a customer, based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Professional services aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of October 2, 2020 and December 31, 2019, contract liabilities were $ 4.8 million and $ 3.6 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the nine months ended October 2, 2020 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, partially offset by $ 3.1 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2019. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 16 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 3. Business Combinations On July 31, 2019 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”), a Wackersdorf, Germany-based supplier of innovative laser scanning subsystems used in industrial materials processing and medical applications, for a total purchase price of € 65.7 million ($ 73.2 million), including net working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 24.0 million ($ 26.7 million) cash paid at closing, 124 thousand Novanta common shares issued upon closing (with a fair market value of € 9.8 million, or $ 10.9 million, based on the closing market price of $ 87.58 per share on July 30, 2019), € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration and € 24.8 million ($ 27.7 million) deferred cash consideration. In connection with the Company’s initiatives to preserve cash during a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company reached an agreement with the former owner of ARGES in April 2020 to settle net working capital adjustments and to postpone a portion of the deferred cash consideration. The Company paid the seller € 5.0 million in cash in June 2020 and expects to pay € 20.0 million in cash in December 2020. The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands): Amount Cash $ 3,159 Accounts receivable 1,430 Inventories 7,129 Property, plant and equipment 14,095 Intangible assets 24,713 Goodwill 44,162 Other assets 2,244 Total assets acquired 96,932 Accounts payable 2,598 Deferred tax liabilities 6,721 Other liabilities 14,462 Total liabilities assumed 23,781 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 73,151 Less: cash acquired 3,159 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 69,992 9 NOVANTA INC.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Loss Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 18,113 ) $ ( 9,218 ) $ ( 8,895 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 762 ) ( 1,006 ) 244 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (1) 525 — 525 Balance at October 2, 2020 $ ( 18,350 ) $ ( 10,224 ) $ ( 8,126 ) (1) The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 5. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019, respectively, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per common share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”) noncontrolling interest shareholders, as well as the non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units are included in the weighted average common share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets as of the end of each reporting period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 2, September 27, October 2, September 27, 2020 (1) 2019 (2) 2020 (1) 2019 (2) Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 8,258 $ 8,923 $ 31,865 $ 31,556 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,142 35,074 35,144 35,012 Dilutive potential common shares 546 511 465 511 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,688 35,585 35,609 35,523 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above — 35 17 43 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.23 $ 0.25 $ 0.91 $ 0.90 Diluted $ 0.23 $ 0.25 $ 0.89 $ 0.89 (1) 73 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders are considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of October 2, 2020. 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) (2) 47 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance -based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest share holders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of September 27, 2019 . 6. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. Based on the revenue performance as of October 2, 2020 and the most recent revenue projections for fiscal years 2021 to 2016, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 6.4 million ($ 7.6 million) as of October 2, 2020. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. In June 2020, the Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million), which is included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended October 2, 2020. There were no other changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration during the nine months ended October 2, 2020. 11 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the asset acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. In February 2020, the Company made the first installment payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million), which is included in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended October 2, 2020. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the nine months ended October 2, 2020.

See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt. 7. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of October 2, 2020, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 7.3 million and a net gain of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 12.4 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net gain of $ 1.0 million and $ 1.4 million for the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020, respectively, and an aggregate net gain of $ 0.7 million and $ 1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and noted no impairment.

The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through December 2024 . The Company repaid € 3.4 million ($ 3.9 million) of its term loan and $ 30.1 million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility during the nine months ended October 2, 2020. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of October 2, 2020. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. Fair Value of Debt As of October 2, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 17 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) 11. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2020 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include terms such as an option to purchase the property, one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms.

Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Common Share Repurchases In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the nine months ended October 2, 2020, the Company repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.5 million at an average price of $ 84.55 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. As of October 2, 2020, the Company had $ 59.5 million available under the 2018 and 2020 share repurchase plans for future share repurchases. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has temporarily suspended repurchases under the share repurchase plans since April 2020. 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 2, September 27, October 2, September 27, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Selling, general and administrative $ 4,265 $ 1,926 $ 10,225 $ 6,546 Research and development and engineering 1,150 171 2,204 466 Cost of revenue 1,589 146 3,185 336 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs 221 — 458 — Total share-based compensation expense $ 7,225 $ 2,243 $ 16,072 $ 7,348 Share-based compensation reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 1.0 million and $ 0.9 million during the nine months ended October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019, respectively. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 162 thousand and 187 thousand DSUs outstanding as of October 2, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended October 2, 2020: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2019 453 $ 39.74 Granted 291 $ 84.20 Vested ( 107 ) $ 51.50 Forfeited ( 7 ) $ 76.54 Unvested at October 2, 2020 630 $ 58.05 Expected to vest as of October 2, 2020 602 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the nine months ended October 2, 2020 was $ 9.7 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended October 2, 2020: Shares (1) (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2019 152 $ 57.09 Granted 50 $ 111.47 Performance adjustment (2) 60 $ 28.80 Vested ( 120 ) $ 28.80 Forfeited ( 1 ) $ 111.50 Unvested at October 2, 2020 141 $ 88.99 Expected to vest as of October 2, 2020 153 (1) The unvested PSUs are shown in this table at target, except for the number of shares vested, which reflects the number of shares earned and expected to vest. As of October 2, 2020, the maximum number of PSUs available to be earned was approximately 283 thousand shares. (2) The amount shown represents performance adjustment for performance-based awards granted on February 28, 2017. These units vested at 200 % during the nine months ended October 2, 2020 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions during the performance period of fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the nine months ended October 2, 2020 was $ 10.8 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Nine Months Ended October 2, 2020 Grant-date stock price $ 96.28 Expected volatility 34.25 % Risk-free interest rate 1.35 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 126.65 21 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) Stock Options The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended October 2, 2020, based on the difference between market price on the date of exercise and the date of grant, was $ 1.0 million. The total amount of cash received from the exercise of these stock options was $ 0.2 million. No stock options were granted during the nine months ended October 2, 2020. There were 60 thousand fully-vested stock options outstanding as of October 2, 2020. 13. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined are more likely than not to be realized. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. For the nine months ended October 2, 2020, in part because the Company achieved three years of cumulative taxable income in the Canadian jurisdiction, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of its Canadian net operating losses are realizable. Therefore, the Company reduced $ 1.1 million of the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets during the nine months ended October 2, 2020. The Company’s Canadian entity serves as a holding company with limited amounts of income and expenses. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income in the carryforward period are reduced or increased. The Company’s effective tax rate of 17.6 % for the three months ended October 2, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. The Company’s effective tax rate of 5.2 % for the nine months ended October 2, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in Canada. For the nine months ended October 2, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and the valuation allowance release had a benefit of 7.9 % and 3.3 %, respectively, on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of 18.8 % for the three months ended September 27, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. The Company’s effective tax rate of 12.9 % for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period. For the nine months ended September 27, 2019, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 7.4 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package which, among other things, contains numerous provisions concerning income taxes. The CARES Act will not have a material impact on the Company’s income taxes or related disclosures. 22 NOVANTA INC.

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2019. Legal Contingencies In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before Novanta acquired it. The arbitration demand alleges breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and no amount has been accrued for in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based 24 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2020 (Unaudited) only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation s and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will hav e a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not hav e a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements . Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 16. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of, and allocates resources to, its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers.

Business Overview We are a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. Reportable Segments We operate in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics Our Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Vision Our Vision segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless, recorder and video integration technologies for operating room integrations; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies, and embedded touch screen solutions. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Precision Motion Our Precision Motion segment designs, manufactures and markets optical and inductive encoders, precision motor and motion control sub-assemblies, servo drives, air bearings, and air bearing spindles to customers worldwide. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020, the medical market accounted for approximately 54% and 56%, respectively, of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 46% and 44%, respectively, of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a 29 manufacturing environment, the f inancial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market . Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the third amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 31, 2019 (the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). The First Amendment exercised a portion of the $200 million uncommitted accordion feature under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and increased the revolving credit facility commitment by $145 million, from $350 million to $495 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200 million for potential future expansion. Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business Our Employees In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We have provided frequent employee communications that include guidance and updates to our employees with regards to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, requiring working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in our facilities to perform their work, suspending travel, spreading production over more shifts, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present in our facilities. We expect to 30 continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investment in technologies and monitoring equipment. We expect such costs to continue to grow and be significant to our cost of operations . We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. We are committed to retaining and supporting our employees during this pandemic. To retain our employees, we issued to substantially all of our employees a special one-time restricted stock unit grant in April 2020 at a total fair value of $14.4 million in the aggregate. The restricted stock units are expected to vest in February 2021. These actions were implemented to create an ownership mindset and focus among all employees for the duration of the crisis and through the expected recovery, while maintaining the Company’s talent and capabilities. Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the 2020 compensation plans for our executive officers and a Section 16 officer (collectively, the “Officers”) in February 2020. To support our business during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Officers agreed to waive their 2020 merit and promotional increases, eliminate their 2020 cash bonuses, and take two weeks of unpaid time-off. Further, the Officers did not receive the one-time special restricted stock unit grant issued to the rest of the employees. These actions will result in an aggregate amount of $1.6 million (approximately 50%) reduction in the 2020 cash compensation, assuming bonuses were paid at target, for these Officers previously approved by the Compensation Committee. In June 2020, our Board of Directors agreed to forgo the cash retainers payable to our non-employee directors for the third quarter of 2020. This action resulted in an aggregate amount of $0.1 million (approximately 25%) reduction in the cash compensation of our Board of Directors for 2020. Our Customers The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The spread of COVID-19 has caused a global economic slowdown and a global recession. In the event of a prolonged economic recession, overall demand for our products could decline further and our business would be adversely affected to a greater extent. Our Facilities Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities worldwide implemented numerous evolving measures to try to contain the spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limits on social gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business shutdowns and social distancing. We have important manufacturing operations in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and China, all of which have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of October 2, 2020, our manufacturing facilities around the world were in operation. While governmental measures may be modified or extended in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections and in the absence of effective vaccines becoming available in the near term, we have taken measures to protect our employees and expect our manufacturing facilities to remain operational. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced limited absenteeism from those employees who are required to be on-site to perform their jobs. Our Supply Chain We have experienced limited disruption to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to date. We regularly monitor the financial health and manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain. Hardship on our suppliers or sub-suppliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could cause further disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are identifying alternative suppliers, sourcing raw materials from different supplier locations, and taking other actions to ensure our supply of raw materials. Although we are mitigating potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. 31 Our Liquidity With respect to liquidity, we have taken actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures across the Company. These actions included reducing hiring activities, restricting travel, adjusting employee compensation by eliminating fiscal year 2020 cash bonuses and base salary increases, implementing an unpaid time-off program for substantially all of our non-production workforce, limiting discretionary spending, reducing or deferring spending on capital investment projects, deferring lease payments on certain facilities, and deferring certain U.S. payroll tax payments for the remainder of 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). As of October 2, 2020, we deferred $2.0 million in certain U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. Due to the uncertainty related to the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended repurchases under our share repurchase plans in April 2020. In connection with our initiatives to preserve cash for a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we reached an agreement with the former owner of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”) in April 2020 to postpone a portion of the deferred cash consideration. We paid the seller €5.0 million in cash in June 2020 and expect to pay €20.0 million in cash in December 2020. As of October 2, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $106.6 million and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of $398.8 million. We have reviewed numerous potential scenarios in connection with the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Based on our analysis, we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from our operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months. Additionally, we believe we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants for the next twelve months.

The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 2.37% during the nine months ended October 2, 2020, versus 3.46% during the nine months ended September 27, 2019. 37 Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $0.1 million net losses for the three months ended October 2, 2020, versus $0.4 million net gains in the prior year period. The decrease in net gains was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and the Euro and lower net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $0.2 million net losses for the nine months ended October 2, 2020, versus $0.5 million net gains in the prior year period. The decrease in net gains was primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and the Euro and lower net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal for both the three and nine months ended October 2, 2020 and the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019. Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rate for the three months ended October 2, 2020 was 17.6%, versus 18.8% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 17.6% for the three months ended October 2, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. Our effective tax rate of 18.8% for the three months ended September 27, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 2, 2020 was 5.2%, versus 12.9% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 5.2% for the nine months ended October 2, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in Canada. For the nine months ended October 2, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and the release of the valuation allowance had a benefit of 7.9% and 3.3%, respectively, on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of 12.9% for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period. For the nine months ended September 27, 2019, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 7.4% on our effective tax rate. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package which, among other things, contains numerous provisions concerning income taxes. The CARES Act will not have a material impact on our income taxes or related disclosures. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside our control, such as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future 38 acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that the applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of October 2, 2020, $69.6 million of our $106.6 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below). Approximately $179.0 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. In connection with our initiatives to preserve cash for a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we reached an agreement with the former owner of ARGES in April 2020 to settle net working capital adjustments and to postpone a portion of the deferred cash consideration. We paid the seller €5.0 million in cash in June 2020 and expect to pay €20.0 million in cash in December 2020. We also are deferring certain U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. As of October 2, 2020, we deferred $2.0 million in certain U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. As permitted under the CARES Act, we expect to pay half of the deferred U.S. payroll tax by December 31, 2021 and the remaining half by December 31, 2022. In addition, with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on liquidity, we have taken actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures across the Company. These included reducing hiring activities, restricting travel, adjusting employee compensation by eliminating fiscal year 2020 cash bonuses and base salary increases, implementing an unpaid time-off program for substantially all of our non-production workforce, limiting discretionary spending, reducing or deferring spending on capital investment projects, and deferring lease payments on certain facilities. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated 5-year term loan facility (approximately €90.2 million) and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. As of October 2, 2020, we had $101.8 million term loan and $96.2 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25% and 1.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of October 2, 2020, we had outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $179.0 million and $19.0 million, respectively. 39 The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenant s and our compliance therewith as of October 2, 2020 : Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.45 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 8.56 Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the nine months ended October 2, 2020, we repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.5 million at an average price of $84.55 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of October 2, 2020. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. No shares have been repurchased under the 2020 Repurchase Plan to date. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended repurchases under our share repurchase plans since April 2020. Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Nine Months Ended October 2, September 27, 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 93,686 $ 27,843 Net cash used in investing activities $ (9,796 ) $ (61,052 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (57,195 ) $ 12,379 October 2, December 31, 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 106,630 $ 78,944 Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility $ 398,773 $ 226,616 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $93.7 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2020, versus $27.8 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended October 2, 2020 increased from the prior year period primarily due to working capital improvements resulting in an increase in cash flows from accounts receivable and inventory, and a decrease in income tax payments. 40 Cash provided by op erating activities for the nine months ended October 2, 2020 was pos itively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.1 at December 31, 2019 to 3. 3 at October 2, 2020 and a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 5 3 days at December 31, 2019 to 4 4 days at October 2, 2020 . During the nine months ended October 2, 2020 , we paid the 201 9 annual employee bonuses which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2019 . Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding which increased from 51 days at December 31, 2018 to 59 days at September 27, 2019 primarily due to poor sales linearity, a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 52 days at December 31, 2018 to 48 days at September 27, 2019 and an increase in inventories. Our inventory turnover ratio decreased from 3.4 at December 31, 2018 to 3.2 at September 27, 2019. During the nine months ended September 27, 2019, we paid the first milestone payment under the earn-out agreement for our acquisition of Zettlex Holdings Limited amounting to $3.9 million and paid the 2018 annual employee bonuses, both of which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2018. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $9.8 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2020, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $7.2 million and a payment for intangible assets of $2.6 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. Cash used in investing activities was $61.1 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, primarily driven by the Arges GmbH, Med X Change Inc., and Ingenia CAT, S.L. acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid $53.1 million cash considerations, net of cash acquired, during the nine months ended September 27, 2019. We also paid $8.0 million for capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 27, 2019. We have no material commitments to purchase property, plant, and equipment as of October 2, 2020. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $8 million to $9 million in fiscal 2020 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $57.2 million for the nine months ended October 2, 2020, primarily due to $34.0 million in repayments of borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, $8.3 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $5.8 million payments of deferred and escrowed purchase price related to prior year acquisitions, $5.5 million of repurchases of common shares, and $1.6 million of fees paid in connection with the First Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We expect to pay the final ARGES deferred purchase price of €20.0 million in cash in December 2020. Cash provided by financing activities was $12.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, primarily due to $66.8 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the Arges GmbH, Med X Change Inc., and Ingenia CAT, S.L. acquisitions, partially offset by $40.8 million repayments of borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, $6.8 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, and $6.7 million of repurchases of common shares. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the principal and interest payments associated with our Senior Credit Facilities, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, pension obligations, deferred cash considerations associated with acquisitions, contingent considerations and earn-outs. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. As of October 2, 2020, other than the First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since December 31, 2019 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through October 2, 2020, we have not entered into any other off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with any unconsolidated entities or other persons. 41 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through October 2, 2020 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity. During the three months ended October 2, 2020, there have been no material changes to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of October 2, 2020, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 2, 2020. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 42 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before Novanta acquired it. The arbitration demand alleges breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and no amount has been accrued for in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors included in our Annual Report. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to further adversely impact our business and results of operations. In 2020, a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic and has spread across the world, including throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant adverse impact, both direct and indirect, on our businesses and the economy. We have experienced weakened demand from certain customers in the advanced industrial and medical end-markets, which has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our revenues. For example, healthcare providers have deferred elective medical procedures in order to focus on combatting the pandemic, which has significantly reduced demand for certain of our medical products. Certain other customers have delayed their research and development programs, which has negatively affected the demand for some of our products. If these trends continue, our revenues will continue to be negatively impacted. We have also faced difficulty sourcing some materials and components necessary to fulfill production requirements and meeting scheduled shipments due to shipping and transportation disruptions. If these disruptions were to worsen, our ability to manufacture our products or meet our customers’ schedules may be adversely affected and our business would be harmed. Even if we are able to find alternate sources of supply for such materials or components, they may cost more or be of lower quality, which could affect our profitability, financial condition and business. While the impact of the pandemic on our manufacturing capabilities and research and development activities has been limited to date, there can be no assurance that our ability to manufacture our products and to develop new products and technologies will not be disrupted in the future, due to sickness of employees, mandatory stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, social distancing practices, supply interruptions or other potential disruptions. We have also faced and may face in the future limitations on our employee resources as a results of various causes, including stay-at-home orders from local governments, sickness of employees or their families, or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people. The pandemic has also diverted management resources and the prolonged work-from-home arrangements have increased business continuity and cybersecurity risks. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, liquidity and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the continued geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, the location, duration and magnitude of future waves of infection, the timing and effectiveness of any vaccines, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States, the European Union, China and 43 other countries, the duration and extent of business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease. If we or our customers experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions in the future , our ability to conduct our business in the manner and within planned timelines could be materially adversely impacted, and our business and financial results may continue to be adversely affected. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets. There is no assurance that future resurgence of COVID-19 infections and further economic downturns will not cause volatilities in the capital markets, which may adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets such as occurred in March and April 2020.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, including estimated economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material change to the consolidated financial statements related to these estimates as of and for the three and six months ended July 3, 2020, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, including: (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (ii) the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment (or vice-versa); and (iii) the exception for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending the existing guidance. January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses of financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. January 1, 2020. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2020. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. ASU 2020-04 is elective. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-04 on its consolidated financial statements. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue . Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time, as the Company has a right to consideration from a customer, based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Professional services aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded as cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of July 3, 2020 and December 31, 2019, contract liabilities were $ 4.6 million and $ 3.6 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the six months ended July 3, 2020 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, partially offset by $ 2.6 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2019. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 16 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 3. Business Combinations On July 31, 2019 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”), a Wackersdorf, Germany-based supplier of innovative laser scanning subsystems used in industrial materials processing and medical applications, for a total purchase price of € 65.7 million ($ 73.2 million), including net working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 24.0 million ($ 26.7 million) cash paid at closing, 124 thousand Novanta common shares issued upon closing (with a fair market value of € 9.8 million, or $ 10.9 million, based on the closing market price of $ 87.58 per share on July 30, 2019), € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration and € 24.8 million ($ 27.7 million) deferred cash consideration. In connection with the Company’s initiatives to preserve cash during a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company reached an agreement with the former owner of ARGES in April 2020 to settle net working capital adjustments and to postpone a portion of the deferred cash consideration. The Company paid the seller € 5.0 million in cash in June 2020 and expects to pay € 20.0 million in cash in December 2020. The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands): Amount Cash $ 3,159 Accounts receivable 1,430 Inventories 7,129 Property, plant and equipment 14,095 Intangible assets 24,713 Goodwill 44,162 Other assets 2,244 Total assets acquired 96,932 Accounts payable 2,598 Deferred tax liabilities 6,721 Other liabilities 14,462 Total liabilities assumed 23,781 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 73,151 Less: cash acquired 3,159 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 69,992 9 NOVANTA INC.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Loss Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 18,113 ) $ ( 9,218 ) $ ( 8,895 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 4,817 ) ( 5,308 ) 491 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (1) 346 — 346 Balance at July 3, 2020 $ ( 22,584 ) $ ( 14,526 ) $ ( 8,058 ) (1) The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 5. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three and six months ended July 3, 2020 and June 28, 2019, respectively, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per common share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”) noncontrolling interest shareholders, as well as the non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units will be included in the weighted average common share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved. 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share ( amounts in thousands, except per share data ): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 3, June 28, July 3, June 28, 2020 (1) 2019 (2) 2020 (1) 2019 (2) Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 11,660 $ 10,380 $ 23,607 $ 22,633 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,137 34,998 35,145 34,981 Dilutive potential common shares 442 505 425 510 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,579 35,503 35,570 35,491 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above — 36 26 47 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.33 $ 0.30 $ 0.67 $ 0.65 Diluted $ 0.33 $ 0.29 $ 0.66 $ 0.64 (1) 71 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders are considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of July 3, 2020. (2) 45 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 thousand shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of June 28, 2019. 6. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. 11 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. There were no changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration during the six months ended July 3, 2020. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. In June 2020, the Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million), which is included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended July 3, 2020. There were no changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration during the six months ended July 3, 2020. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the asset acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset. In February 2020, the Company made the first installment payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million), which is included in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended July 3, 2020. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the six months ended July 3, 2020. 12 NOVANTA INC.

See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt. 7. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of July 3, 2020, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 26.7 million and a net gain of $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 12.4 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net gain of $ 0.7 million and $ 0.4 million for the three and six months ended July 3, 2020, respectively, and an aggregate net gain of $ 0.9 million and $ 0.4 million for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 and noted no impairment. 14 NOVANTA INC.

The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. 17 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through December 2024 . The Company repaid € 2.3 million ($ 2.5 million) of its term loan during the six months ended July 3, 2020. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of July 3, 2020. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. Fair Value of Debt As of July 3, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 11. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2020 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include terms such as an option to purchase the property, one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms.

Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Common Share Repurchases In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the six months ended July 3, 2020, the Company repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.5 million at an average price of $ 84.55 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. As of July 3, 2020, the Company had $ 59.5 million available under the 2018 and 2020 share repurchase plans for future share repurchases. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has temporarily suspended repurchases under the share repurchase plans since April 2020. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 3, June 28, July 3, June 28, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Selling, general and administrative $ 3,162 $ 2,089 $ 5,960 $ 4,620 Research and development and engineering 861 184 1,054 295 Cost of revenue 1,388 105 1,596 190 Restructuring, acquisition, and related costs 237 — 237 — Total share-based compensation expense $ 5,648 $ 2,378 $ 8,847 $ 5,105 Share-based compensation reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 1.0 million and $ 0.9 million during the six months ended July 3, 2020 and June 28, 2019, respectively. 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 162 thousand and 187 thousand DSUs outstanding as of July 3, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended July 3, 2020: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2019 453 $ 39.74 Granted 284 $ 84.90 Vested ( 97 ) $ 51.71 Forfeited ( 4 ) $ 71.89 Unvested at July 3, 2020 636 $ 58.06 Expected to vest as of July 3, 2020 600 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the six months ended July 3, 2020 was $ 9.4 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. 21 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended July 3, 2020: Shares (1) (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2019 152 $ 57.09 Granted 50 $ 111.47 Performance adjustment (2) 60 $ 28.80 Vested ( 120 ) $ 28.80 Unvested at July 3, 2020 142 $ 89.05 Expected to vest as of July 3, 2020 158 (1) The unvested PSUs are shown in this table at target, except for the number of shares vested, which reflects the number of shares earned and expected to vest. As of July 3, 2020, the maximum number of PSUs available to be earned was approximately 284 thousand shares. (2) The amount shown represents performance adjustment for performance-based awards granted on February 28, 2017. These units vested at 200 % during the six months ended July 3, 2020 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions during the performance period of fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the six months ended July 3, 2020 was $ 10.8 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Six Months Ended July 3, 2020 Grant-date stock price $ 96.28 Expected volatility 34.25 % Risk-free interest rate 1.35 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 126.65 Stock Options The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the six months ended July 3, 2020, based on the difference between market price on the date of exercise and the date of grant, was $ 1.0 million. The total amount of cash received from the exercise of these stock options was $ 0.2 million. No stock options were granted during the six months ended July 3, 2020. There were 60 thousand fully-vested stock options outstanding as of July 3, 2020. 13. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain non-U.S. tax attributes that the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. A valuation allowance is 22 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. I n conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. For the three and six months ended July 3, 2020, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $ 1.3 million due to the release of a portion of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which the Company believes will more likely than not be realized. The Company’s effective tax rate of 0.3 % for the three months ended July 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance. For the three months ended July 3, 2020, the valuation allowance release had a benefit of 11.4 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of ( 0 %) for the six months ended July 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance. For the six months ended July 3, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and the valuation allowance release had a benefit of 11.2 % and 5.7 %, respectively, on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of 19.5 % for the three months ended June 28, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, and U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. The Company’s effective tax rate of 10.3 % for the six months ended June 28, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. For the six months ended June 28, 2019, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 10.6 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package which, among other things, contains numerous provisions concerning income taxes. The CARES Act will not have a material impact on the Company’s income taxes or related disclosures. 14.

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2019. 24 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF JULY 3, 2020 (Unaudited) Legal Contingencies In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before Novanta acquired it. The arbitration demand alleges breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and no amount has been accrued for in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 16. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.

Business Overview We are a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. Reportable Segments We operate in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics Our Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Vision Our Vision segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless, recorder and video integration technologies for operating room integrations; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies, and embedded touch screen solutions. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors.

The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the three and six months ended July 3, 2020, the medical market accounted for approximately 55% and 57%, respectively, of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the three and six months ended July 3, 2020, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 45% and 43%, respectively, of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing 30 environment, the f inancial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market . Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the third amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 31, 2019 (the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). The First Amendment exercised a portion of the $200 million uncommitted accordion feature under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and increased the revolving credit facility commitment by $145 million, from $350 million to $495 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200 million for potential future expansion. Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business Our Employees In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive action to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We enacted rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, requiring working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in our facilities to perform their work, suspending travel, spreading production over more shifts, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present in our facilities. We instituted frequent, often daily, employee communications, providing guidance and updates to our employees with regard to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We expect to continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. We 31 have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs to protect the health of our employees. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. We are committed to retaining and supporting our employees during this pandemic. To retain our employees, we issued to substantially all of our employees a special one-time restricted stock unit grant in April 2020 totaling $14.4 million in the aggregate, which will vest in February 2021. During the three months ended July 3, 2020, we provided special cash incentive bonuses to the majority of our on-site production staff for keeping our factories open and running during the pandemic. In addition to retention, these actions were implemented to create an ownership mindset and focus among all employees for the duration of the crisis and through the expected recovery, while maintaining the Company’s talent and capabilities. Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the 2020 compensation plans for our executive officers and a Section 16 officer (collectively, the “Officers”) in February 2020. To support our business during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Officers agreed to waive their 2020 merit and promotional increases, eliminate their 2020 cash bonuses, and take two weeks of unpaid time-off. Further, the Officers will not receive the one-time special restricted stock unit grant issued to the rest of the employees. These actions will result in an aggregate amount of $1.6 million (approximately 50%) reduction in the 2020 cash compensation, assuming bonuses were paid at target, for these Officers previously approved by the Compensation Committee in February 2020. In June 2020, our Board of Directors agreed to forgo the cash retainers payable to our non-employee directors for the third quarter of 2020. This action will result in an aggregate amount of $0.1 million (approximately 25%) reduction in cash compensation of our Board of Directors for 2020. Our Customers The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The spread of COVID-19 has caused a global economic slowdown and may cause a severe global recession. In the event of a prolonged economic recession, overall demand for our products could decline further and our business would be adversely affected to a greater extent. Our Facilities Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities worldwide implemented numerous evolving measures to try to contain the spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limits on social gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business shutdowns and social distancing. We have important manufacturing operations in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and China, all of which have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the date of this filing, our manufacturing facilities around the world are in operation. While governmental measures may be modified or extended in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections and in the absence of effective vaccines becoming available, we have taken measures to protect our employees and expect that our manufacturing facilities will remain operational. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced limited absenteeism from those employees who are required to be on-site to perform their jobs. Our Supply Chain We have experienced limited disruption to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to date. We regularly monitor the financial health and manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain. Hardship on our suppliers or sub-suppliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could cause further disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are identifying alternative suppliers, sourcing raw materials from different supplier locations, and taking other actions to ensure our supply of raw materials. Although we are mitigating potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, has resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and shipping finished products to customers. 32 Our Liquidity With respect to liquidity, we are evaluating and taking actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures across the Company. These actions include reducing hiring activities, restricting travel, adjusting employee compensation by eliminating fiscal year 2020 cash bonuses and base salary increases, implementing an unpaid time-off program for substantially all of our non-production workforce, limiting discretionary spending, reducing or deferring spending on capital investment projects, deferring certain U.S. payroll tax payments for the remainder of 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), deferring lease payments on certain facilities and temporarily suspending repurchases under our share repurchase plans. As of July 3, 2020, we deferred $1.1 million in certain U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. As of July 3, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $97.5 million and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of $372.1 million. We have reviewed numerous potential scenarios in connection with the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Based on our analysis, we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from our operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months. Additionally, we believe we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants for the next twelve months. In connection with our initiatives to preserve cash from a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we reached an agreement with the former owner of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”) in April 2020 to postpone a portion of the deferred cash consideration. We paid the seller €5.0 million in cash in June 2020 and expect to pay €20.0 million in cash in December 2020.

Our effective tax rate of 0.3% for the three months ended July 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in Canada. For the three months ended July 3, 2020, the release of the valuation allowance had a benefit of 11.4% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of 19.5% for the three months ended June 28, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. and patent box deductions and other tax credits. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended July 3, 2020 was (0%), versus 10.3% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of (0%) for the six months ended July 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period, and a release of a portion of the valuation allowance. For the six months ended July 3, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards and the release of the valuation allowance had a benefit of 11.2% and 5.7%, respectively, on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of 10.3% for the six months ended June 28, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. For the six months ended June 28, 2019, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 10.6% on our effective tax rate. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package which, among other things, contains numerous provisions concerning income taxes. The CARES Act will not have a material impact on our income taxes or related disclosures. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit 39 facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may also seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside our control, such as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that the applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of July 3, 2020, $61.4 million of our $97.5 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (defined below). Approximately $187.0 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. In connection with our initiatives to preserve cash from a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we reached an agreement with the former owner of ARGES in April 2020 to settle net working capital adjustments and to postpone a portion of the deferred cash consideration. We paid the seller €5.0 million in cash in June 2020 and expect to pay €20.0 million in cash in December 2020. We also are deferring certain U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. As of July 3, 2020, we deferred $1.1 million in certain U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. In addition, with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on liquidity, we are evaluating and have taken actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures across the Company. These include reducing hiring activities, restricting travel, adjusting employee compensation by eliminating fiscal year 2020 cash bonuses and base salary increases, implementing an unpaid time-off program for substantially all of our non-production workforce, limiting discretionary spending, reducing or deferring spending on capital investment projects, and deferring lease payments on certain facilities. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated 5-year term loan facility (approximately €90.2 million) and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. As of July 3, 2020, we had a €87.9 million euro-denominated term loan (approximately $99.1 million) and $122.9 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25% to 1.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused 40 portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio . The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of July 3, 2020: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.66 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 7.26 Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the six months ended July 3, 2020, we repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.5 million at an average price of $84.55 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of July 3, 2020. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. No shares have been repurchased under the 2020 Repurchase Plan to date. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended repurchases under our share repurchase plans since April 2020. Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended July 3, 2020 and June 28, 2019 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Six Months Ended July 3, June 28, 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 51,572 $ 20,853 Net cash used in investing activities $ (7,272 ) $ (34,444 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (24,978 ) $ (2,798 ) July 3, December 31, 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 97,494 $ 78,944 Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility $ 372,097 $ 226,616 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $51.6 million for the six months ended July 3, 2020, versus $20.9 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended July 3, 2020 increased from the prior year period primarily 41 due to working capital improvements resulting in an increase in cash flows from accounts receivable and inventory , and a decrease in income tax payments. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended July 3, 2020 was positively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.1 at December 31, 2019 to 3.2 at July 3, 2020 and a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 53 days at December 31, 2019 to 49 days at July 3, 2020. During the six months ended July 3, 2020, we paid the 2019 annual employee bonuses which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 28, 2019 was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding which increased from 51 days at December 31, 2018 to 52 days at June 28, 2019, a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 52 days at December 31, 2018 to 51 days at June 28, 2019 and an increase in inventories, as our inventory turnover ratio decreased from 3.4 at December 31, 2018 to 3.2 at June 28, 2019. During the six months ended June 28, 2019, we paid the first milestone payment under the earn-out agreement for our acquisition of Zettlex Holdings Limited amounting to $3.9 million and paid the 2018 annual employee bonuses, both of which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2018. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $7.3 million for the six months ended July 3, 2020, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $4.6 million and a payment for intangible assets of $2.6 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. Cash used in investing activities was $34.4 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, primarily driven by the Ingenia and Med X Change acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid $28.9 million cash considerations (net of cash acquired of $1.0 million) during the six months ended June 28, 2019. We also paid $5.6 million for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 28, 2019. We have no material commitments to purchase property, plant, and equipment as of July 3, 2020. We expect to use an aggregate of approximately $6 million to $8 million in fiscal 2020 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $25.0 million for the six months ended July 3, 2020, primarily due to $7.9 million of payroll tax payments on share-based compensation awards, ARGES deferred purchase price payment of $5.6 million, $5.5 million of repurchases of common shares, $2.5 million repayment of our term loan, and $1.6 million of fees paid in connection with the First Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Cash used in financing activities was $2.8 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, primarily due to $16.1 million of term loan payments, $6.7 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards, and $3.3 million of repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $23.6 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the Ingenia and Med X Change acquisitions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the principal and interest associated with our Senior Credit Facilities, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, pension obligations, deferred cash considerations associated with acquisitions, contingent considerations and earn-outs. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. As of July 3, 2020, other than the First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through July 3, 2020, we have not entered into any other off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with any unconsolidated entities or other persons. 42 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through July 3, 2020 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity. During the three months ended July 3, 2020, there have been no material changes to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of July 3, 2020, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 3, 2020. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended July 3, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 43 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors included in our Annual Report. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to further adversely impact our business and results of operations. In 2020, a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic and has spread across the world, including throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant adverse impact, both direct and indirect, on our businesses and the economy. We have experienced weakened demand from certain customers in the advanced industrial and medical end-markets, which has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our revenues. For example, healthcare providers have deferred elective medical procedures in order to focus on combatting the pandemic, which has significantly reduced demand for certain of our medical products. Certain other customers have delayed their research and development programs, which has negatively affected the demand for some of our products. If these trends continue, our revenues will continue to be negatively impacted. We have also faced difficulty sourcing some materials and components necessary to fulfill production requirements and meeting scheduled shipments due to shipping and transportation disruptions. If these disruptions were to worsen, our ability to manufacture our products or meet our customers’ schedules may be adversely affected and our business would be harmed. Even if we are able to find alternate sources of supply for such materials or components, they may cost more or be of lower quality, which could affect our profitability, financial condition and business. While the impact of the pandemic on our manufacturing capabilities has been limited to date, there can be no assurance that our ability to manufacture our products will not be disrupted in the future, due to sickness of employees, mandatory stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, supply interruptions or other potential disruptions. We have also faced and may face in the future limitations on our employee resources as a results of various causes, including stay-at-home orders from local governments, mandatory furloughs for one week per quarter for substantially all non-manufacturing employees, sickness of employees or their families, or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people. The pandemic has also diverted management resources and the prolonged work-from-home arrangements have created business continuity and increased cybersecurity risks. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, liquidity and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the continued geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, the location, duration and magnitude of future waves of infection, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States, the European Union, China and other countries, the duration and extent of business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease. If we or our customers experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions beyond current expectations, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and within planned timelines could be materially adversely impacted, and our business and financial results may continue to be adversely affected. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets, which adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets. 44 I tem 2.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, including estimated economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material change to the consolidated financial statements related these estimates as of and for the three months ended April 3, 2020, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, including: (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (ii) the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment (or vice-versa); and (iii) the exception for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending the existing guidance. January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses of financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. January 1, 2020. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2020. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. ASU 2020-04 is elective. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-04 on its consolidated financial statements. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue . Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services for the maintenance and repair of products are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The related revenue is recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is typically the contractually stated amount. Certain engineering services are longer in duration and the related revenue is recognized over time, as the Company has a right to consideration from a customer, based on the corresponding value to the customer from the Company’s performance completed to date. Professional services aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of April 3, 2020 and December 31, 2019, contract liabilities were 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) $ 3.3 million and $ 3.6 million, res pectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The de crease in the contract liability balance during the three months ended April 3, 2020 is primarily due to $ 2.1 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2019, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations . Disaggregated Revenue See Note 16 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 3. Business Combinations On July 31, 2019 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”), a Wackersdorf, Germany-based manufacturer of innovative laser scanning subsystems used in industrial materials processing and medical applications, for a total purchase price of € 65.7 million ($ 73.2 million), including net working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 24.0 million ($ 26.7 million) cash paid at closing, 124 thousand Novanta common shares issued upon closing (with a fair market value of € 9.8 million, or $ 10.9 million, based on the closing market price of $ 87.58 per share on July 30, 2019), € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration and € 24.8 million ($ 27.7 million) deferred cash consideration. In connection with the Company’s initiatives to preserve cash during a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company reached an agreement with the former owner of ARGES in April 2020 to settle net working capital adjustments and to postpone a portion of the deferred cash consideration. The Company is now expected to pay the seller € 5.0 million ($ 5.4 million) in cash in June 2020 and € 20.0 million ($ 21.7 million) in cash in December 2020. 4. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Loss Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 18,113 ) $ ( 9,218 ) $ ( 8,895 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 6,241 ) ( 6,806 ) 565 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (1) 172 — 172 Balance at April 3, 2020 $ ( 24,182 ) $ ( 16,024 ) $ ( 8,158 ) (1) The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 5. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three months ended April 3, 2020 and March 29, 2019, respectively, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per common share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”) noncontrolling interest shareholders, as well as the non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units will be included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved. 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, 2020(1) 2019(2) Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 11,947 $ 12,253 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,152 34,958 Dilutive potential common shares 409 516 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,561 35,474 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 52 58 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 0.34 $ 0.35 Diluted $ 0.34 $ 0.35 (1) 71,166 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213,219 shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders are considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of April 3, 2020. (2) 45,252 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213,219 shares of restricted stock issued to the former Laser Quantum non-controlling interest shareholders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of March 29, 2019. 6. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring and acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. There were no changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three months ended April 3, 2020. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring and acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. There were no changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three months ended April 3, 2020. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the asset acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset. The Company made the first installment payment of $ 2.6 million in February 2020, which is included in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the three months ended April 3, 2020. There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three months ended April 3, 2020. 11 NOVANTA INC.

See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt. 7. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of April 3, 2020, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 28.8 million and a net loss of $ 0.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 12.4 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net loss of $ 0.3 million and an aggregate net loss of $ 0.5 million for the three months ended April 3, 2020 and March 29, 2019, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances for impairment annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company 13 NOVANTA INC.

The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. 16 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million beginning in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through December 2024 . The Company repaid € 1.1 million ($ 1.2 million) of its term loan during the three months ended April 3, 2020. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of April 3, 2020. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. Fair Value of Debt As of April 3, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 11. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2020 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include terms such as an option to purchase the property, one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination options is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable lives of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the expected lease terms. The following table summarizes the components of lease costs (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 2,037 $ 1,823 Finance lease cost Amortization of right-of-use assets 248 178 Interest on lease liabilities 110 105 Variable lease cost 379 138 Total lease cost $ 2,774 $ 2,244 17 NOVANTA INC.

Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Common Share Repurchases In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the three months ended April 3, 2020, the Company repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.5 million at an average price of $ 84.55 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of common shares. As of April 3, 2020, the Company had $ 59.5 million under the 2018 and 2020 share repurchase plans available for future share repurchases. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has temporarily suspended repurchases under the share repurchase plans. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, 2020 2019 Selling, general and administrative $ 2,798 $ 2,531 Research and development and engineering 193 111 Cost of revenue 208 85 Total share-based compensation expense $ 3,199 $ 2,727 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) Share-based compensation reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 0.9 million and $ 0.8 million during the three months ended April 3, 2020 and March 29, 2019, respectively. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 192 thousand and 187 thousand DSUs outstanding as of April 3, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended April 3, 2020: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2019 453 $ 39.74 Granted 96 $ 95.58 Vested ( 94 ) $ 51.42 Forfeited — $ — Unvested at April 3, 2020 455 $ 49.39 Expected to vest as of April 3, 2020 425 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the three months ended April 3, 2020 was $ 9.0 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company granted two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended April 3, 2020: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2019 152 $ 57.09 Granted 50 $ 111.47 Performance adjustment (1) 60 $ 28.80 Vested ( 120 ) $ 28.80 Unvested at April 3, 2020 142 $ 89.05 Expected to vest as of April 3, 2020 173 (1) The amount shown represents performance adjustment for performance-based awards granted on February 28, 2017. These units vested at 200 % during the three months ended April 3, 2020 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions during the performance period of fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the three months ended April 3, 2020 was $ 10.8 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Three Months Ended April 3, 2020 Grant-date stock price $ 96.28 Expected volatility 34.25 % Risk-free interest rate 1.35 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 126.65 Stock Options The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the three months ended April 3, 2020, based on the difference between market price on the date of exercise and the date of grant, was $ 1.0 million. The total amount of cash received from the exercise of these stock options was $ 0.2 million. There were 60 thousand fully-vested stock options outstanding as of April 3, 2020. No stock options were granted during the three months ended April 3, 2020. 13. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of ( 0.3 )% for the three months ended April 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended April 3, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 19.8 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. 21 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) The Company’s effective tax rate of 0.6 % for the three months ended March 29, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended March 29, 2019, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards had a benefit of 19.3 % on the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on some of its deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package which, among other things, contains numerous provisions concerning income taxes. While the Company continues to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act, it does not currently believe it will have a material impact on the Company’s income taxes or related disclosures. 14.

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2019. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in 23 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF APRIL 3, 2020 (Unaudited) certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 16.

Business Overview We are a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. Reportable Segments We operate in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics Our Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, solid state laser, ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures.

The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the three months ended April 3, 2020, the medical market accounted for approximately 58% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the three months ended April 3, 2020, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 42% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial 28 condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market . Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the third amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 31, 2019 (the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). The First Amendment exercised a portion of the $200 million uncommitted accordion feature under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and increased the revolving credit facility commitment by $145 million, from $350 million to $495 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200 million for potential future expansion. Impact of COVID-19 on our Business Our Employees In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive action to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We enacted rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, requiring working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or onsite to perform their work, suspending travel, spreading work over more shifts, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present. We instituted frequent, often daily, employee communications, providing guidance and updates to our employees with regard to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We expect to continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. We have incurred and expect to 29 continue to incur additional costs to protect the health of our employees. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees. We are committed to retaining and supporting our employees during this pandemic. To retain our employees, we issued to substantially all of our employees a special one-time restricted stock unit grant in April 2020 totaling $14.4 million in aggregate, which will vest in February 2021. For the majority of our on-site production staff, we will also be providing special cash incentive bonuses during the pandemic for keeping our factories open and running. In addition to retention, these actions were implemented to create an ownership mindset and focus among all employees for the duration of the crisis and through the expected recovery, while maintaining the Company’s talent and capabilities. We are also committed to providing non-monetary support to our communities. For example, we donated 10,000 facemasks to a local hospital in the U.S. Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the 2020 compensation plans for our executive officers and a Section 16 officer (collectively, the “Officers”) in February 2020. To support our business during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Officers agreed to waive their 2020 merit and promotional increases, eliminate their 2020 cash bonuses, and take two weeks of unpaid time-off. Further, the Officers will not receive the one-time special restricted stock unit grant issued to the rest of the employees. These actions will result in an aggregate amount of $1.6 million (approximately 50%) reduction in the 2020 cash compensation, assuming bonuses were paid at target, for these Officers previously approved by the Compensation Committee in February 2020. Our Customers The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. We believe that a portion of recent customer orders may be attributable to customers increasing their inventory levels to reduce their exposure to risks of future supply disruptions, which could be an offset to future demand for our products. We anticipate that the spread of COVID-19 will cause a prolonged global economic slowdown, and it is possible that it may cause a severe global recession. In the event of a recession, overall demand for our products could decline and our business would be adversely affected. Our Facilities Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limits on social gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. We have important manufacturing operations in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and China, all of which have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the date of this filing, our manufacturing facilities around the world are in operation. While governmental measures may be modified or extended, we expect that our manufacturing facilities will remain operational. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced limited absenteeism from those employees who are required to be on-site to perform their jobs. Our Supply Chain We have experienced limited disruption to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to date. Certain of our suppliers have faced difficulties maintaining operations in light of government-ordered restrictions, shelter-in-place mandates, and other factors. We regularly monitor the financial health and manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain. Hardship on our suppliers or sub-suppliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could cause further disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are identifying alternative suppliers, sourcing raw materials from different supplier locations, and taking other actions to ensure our supply of raw materials. Although we are mitigating potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, may result in higher costs and delays, both on obtaining raw materials and shipping finished goods to customers, which could harm our profitability, make our products less competitive, or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers. 30 Our Liquidity With respect to liquidity, we are evaluating and taking actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures across the Company. These actions include reducing hiring activities, restricting travel, adjusting employee compensation by eliminating fiscal year 2020 cash bonuses and base salary increases, implementing an unpaid time-off program for substantially all of our non-production workforce, limiting discretionary spending, reducing or deferring spending on capital investment projects, deferring certain U.S. payroll tax payments for the remainder of 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), deferring lease payments on certain facilities and temporarily suspending repurchases under our share repurchase plans. As of April 3, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $73.7 million and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of $374.9 million. We have reviewed numerous potential scenarios in connection with the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Based on our analysis, we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from our operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months. Additionally, we believe we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants for the next twelve months. In connection with our initiatives to preserve cash from a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we reached an agreement with the former owner of ARGES in April 2020 to postpone a portion of the deferred cash consideration. We are now expected to pay the seller €5.0 million ($5.4 million) in cash in June 2020 and €20.0 million ($21.7 million) in cash in December 2020. Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended April 3, 2020 Compared with the Three Months Ended March 29, 2019 The following table sets forth our unaudited results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, 2020 2019 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 58.5 57.8 Gross profit 41.5 42.2 Operating expenses: Research and development and engineering 9.9 8.9 Selling, general and administrative 19.8 20.3 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 2.2 2.5 Restructuring and acquisition related costs 1.1 1.3 Total operating expenses 33.0 33.0 Operating income 8.5 9.2 Interest income (expense), net (1.1 ) (1.3 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net 0.2 0.0 Other income (expense), net 0.1 (0.0 ) Income before income taxes 7.7 7.8 Income tax provision (benefit) (0.0 ) 0.0 Consolidated net income 7.7 % 7.8 % Overview of Financial Results Total revenue of $155.5 million for the three months ended April 3, 2020 decreased $1.7 million, or 1.1%, from the prior year period primarily due to decreased demand in the advanced industrial market related to reductions in industrial manufacturing spending, partially offset by revenue growth in our medical market. The effect of our prior year acquisitions resulted in an increase in revenue of $6.6 million, or 4.2%. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by $1.5 million, or 1%, for the three months ended April 3, 2020. Operating income of $13.3 million for the three months ended April 3, 2020 decreased $1.1 million, or 7.9%, from the prior year period. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross profit of $1.8 million as a result of lower revenue, offset by decreases in amortization expense and restructuring and acquisition related costs. 31 Basic earnings per common share (“ B asic EPS”) of $ 0. 34 for the three months ended April 3, 2020 decreased $ 0. 01 from the prior year period. Diluted earnings per common share (“Diluted EPS”) of $0. 34 for the three months ended April 3, 2020 decreased $0. 01 from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income. Revenue The following table sets forth external revenue by reportable segment for the periods noted (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, Increase Percentage 2020 2019 (Decrease) Change Photonics $ 55,140 $ 59,225 $ (4,085 ) (6.9 )% Vision 69,008 65,936 3,072 4.7 % Precision Motion 31,320 32,025 (705 ) (2.2 )% Total $ 155,468 $ 157,186 $ (1,718 ) (1.1 )% Photonics Photonics segment revenue for the three months ended April 3, 2020 decreased by $4.1 million, or 6.9%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to decreased demand in the advanced industrial market related to reductions in industrial manufacturing spending and a decrease in revenue from our optical light engine products, partially offset by revenue of $3.2 million from the ARGES acquisition in July 2019. Vision Vision segment revenue for the three months ended April 3, 2020 increased by $3.1 million, or 4.7%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenue of $2.7 million as a result of the Med X Change acquisition in June 2019. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment revenue for the three months ended April 3, 2020 decreased by $0.7 million, or 2.2%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to decreased demand in the advanced industrial market related to reductions in industrial manufacturing spending, partially offset by the Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”) acquisition in April 2019. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin The following table sets forth the gross profit and gross profit margin for each of our reportable segments for the periods noted (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, 2020 2019 Gross profit: Photonics $ 24,661 $ 27,314 Vision 26,575 25,973 Precision Motion 13,908 13,521 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (699 ) (519 ) Total $ 64,445 $ 66,289 Gross profit margin: Photonics 44.7 % 46.1 % Vision 38.5 % 39.4 % Precision Motion 44.4 % 42.2 % Total 41.5 % 42.2 % Gross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, headcount, inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses. 32 Photonics Photonics segment gross profit for the three months ended April 3, 2020 decreased $2.7 million, or 9.7%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in revenue. Photonics segment gross profit margin was 44.7% for the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus a gross profit margin of 46.1% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to product mix and operational inefficiencies. Vision Vision segment gross profit for the three months ended April 3, 2020 increased $0.6 million, or 2.3%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenue. Vision segment gross profit margin was 38.5% for the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus a gross profit margin of 39.4% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to product mix. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment gross profit for the three months ended April 3, 2020 increased $0.4 million, or 2.9%, versus the prior year period, primarily due an increase in gross profit margin. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 44.4% for the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus a gross profit margin of 42.2% for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to product mix and operational improvements. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expenses for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, 2020 2019 Research and development and engineering $ 15,334 $ 13,997 Selling, general and administrative 30,755 31,847 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 3,445 3,998 Restructuring and acquisition related costs 1,661 2,054 Total $ 51,195 $ 51,896 Research and Development and Engineering Expenses Research and Development and Engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. R&D expenses were $15.3 million, or 9.9% of revenue, during the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus $14.0 million, or 8.9% of revenue, during the prior year period. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to R&D expenses from prior year acquisitions. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems, and executive management functions. SG&A expenses were $30.8 million, or 19.8% of revenue, during the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus $31.8 million, or 20.3% of revenue, during the prior year period. SG&A expenses decreased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to lower variable compensation as we eliminated 2020 annual bonuses. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies included in cost of revenue, was $3.4 million, or 2.2% of revenue, during the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus $4.0 million, or 2.5% of revenue, during the prior year period. 33 Restructuring and Acquisition Related Costs We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $1.7 million during the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus $2.1 million during the prior year period. The decrease in restructuring and acquisition related costs versus the prior year period was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring charges of $0.6 million as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs, partially offset by an increase in acquisition related costs of $0.2 million primarily related to expenses under an earn-out agreement associated with the Zettlex acquisition in May 2018. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, 2020 2019 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 8,915 $ 12,310 Vision 5,634 4,557 Precision Motion 6,538 5,635 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (7,837 ) (8,109 ) Total $ 13,250 $ 14,393 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $8.9 million, or 16.2% of revenue, during the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus $12.3 million, or 20.8% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $2.7 million and an increase in R&D spending of $1.2 million primarily due to R&D expenses from a prior year acquisition, offset by a decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $0.4 million. Vision Vision segment operating income was $5.6 million, or 8.2% of revenue, during the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus $4.6 million, or 6.9% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $0.6 million, a decrease of SG&A expenses of $0.6 million, and a decrease in restructuring related charges of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses of $0.3 million. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $6.5 million, or 20.9% of revenue, during the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus $5.6 million, or 17.6% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $0.4 million and decrease in SG&A expenses of $0.4 million. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs. These costs for the three months ended April 3, 2020 decreased by $0.3 million versus the prior year period. Other Income and Expense Items The following table sets forth other income and expense items for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, 2020 2019 Interest income (expense), net $ (1,678 ) $ (2,044 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net 254 41 Other income (expense), net 83 (68 ) 34 Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $1.7 million for the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus $2.0 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 2.39% during the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus 3.78% during the three months ended March 29, 2019. As of April 3, 2020, our outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement were denominated in Euro, British Pound, and U.S Dollars totaling $168.2 million, $13.6 million, and $35.0 million, respectively. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $0.3 million net gains for the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus less than $0.1 million net gains in the prior year period. The increase in net gains was due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Euro and realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal for the three months ended April 3, 2020 and the three months ended March 29, 2019. Income Taxes Provision (Benefit) Our effective tax rate for the three months ended April 3, 2020 was a benefit of (0.3)% versus a provision of 0.6% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of (0.3)% for the three months ended April 3, 2020 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended April 3, 2020, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 19.8% on our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate of 0.6% for the three months ended March 29, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. For the three months ended March 29, 2019, the windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards had a benefit of 19.3% on our effective tax rate. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package which, among other things, contains numerous provisions concerning income taxes. While the Company continues to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act, it does not currently believe it will have a material impact on the Company’s income taxes or related disclosures. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside our control, such as the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. 35 Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that the applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of April 3, 2020, $55.8 million of our $73.7 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (defined below). Approximately $181.8 million of our outstanding term loan and revolver borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. In connection with our initiatives to preserve cash from a prolonged economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we reached an agreement with the former owner of ARGES in April 2020 to settle net working capital adjustments and to postpone a portion of the deferred cash consideration. We are now expected to pay the seller €5.0 million ($5.4 million) in cash in June 2020 and €20.0 million ($21.7 million) in cash in December 2020. We also expect to defer certain U.S. payroll tax payments for the remainder of 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. In addition, with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on liquidity, we are evaluating and taking actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures across the Company. These include reducing hiring activities, restricting travel, adjusting employee compensation by eliminating fiscal year 2020 cash bonuses and base salary increases, implementing an unpaid time-off program for substantially all of our non-production workforce, limiting discretionary spending, reducing or deferring spending on capital investment projects, and deferrals lease payments on certain facilities. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated 5-year term loan facility (approximately €90.2 million) and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 and included an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at any time. On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. As of April 3, 2020, we had a €89.0 million euro-denominated term loan (approximately $96.7 million) and $120.1 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25% to 1.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of April 3, 2020: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.83 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 6.14 36 Share Repurchase Plan s Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the three months ended April 3, 2020, we repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.5 million at an average price of $84.55 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of April 3, 2020. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. No shares have been repurchased under the 2020 Repurchase Plan to date. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended repurchases under our share repurchase plans. Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended April 3, 2020 and March 29, 2019 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended April 3, March 29, 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 17,755 $ 5,457 Net cash used in investing activities $ (5,101 ) $ (2,405 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (16,045 ) $ (10,630 ) April 3, December 31, 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 73,701 $ 78,944 Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility $ 374,888 $ 226,616 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $17.8 million for the three months ended April 3, 2020, versus $5.5 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended April 3, 2020 increased from the prior year period primarily due to working capital improvements resulting in an increase in cash flows from accounts receivable and inventories. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended April 3, 2020 was positively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.1 at December 31, 2019 to 3.2 at April 3, 2020 and a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 53 days at December 31, 2019 to 50 days at April 3, 2020. During the three months ended April 3, 2020, we paid the 2019 annual employee bonuses which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 29, 2019 was negatively impacted by the timing of sales and inventory purchases in the three months ended March 29, 2019, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. During the three months ended March 29, 2019, we paid the first milestone payment under the earn-out agreement for the Zettlex acquisition amounting to $3.9 million and paid the 2018 annual employee bonuses, both of which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2018. 37 Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $5.1 million for the three months ended April 3, 2020, related to capital expenditures of $2.3 million and a payment for intangible assets of $2.6 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. Cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019, primarily related to capital expenditures. We have no material commitments to purchase property, plant, and equipment as of April 3, 2020. We expect to use approximately $6 million to $8 million in 2020 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $16.0 million for the three months ended April 3, 2020, primarily due to $1.3 million of term loan repayments, $1.3 million of fees paid in connection with the First Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, $7.8 million of payroll tax payments on share-based compensation awards, and $5.5 million of repurchases of common shares. Cash used in financing activities was $10.6 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019, primarily due to $4.6 million of term loan repayments, $5.9 million of payroll tax payments on stock-based compensation awards, and $0.1 million of principal payments under our finance lease obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the principal and interest associated with our Senior Credit Facilities, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments, pension obligations, deferred cash considerations associated with acquisitions, contingent considerations and earn-outs. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. As of April 3, 2020, other than the First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through April 3, 2020, we have not entered into any other off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with any unconsolidated entities or other persons. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates through April 3, 2020 from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our primary market risk exposures are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate sensitivity. During the three months ended April 3, 2020, there have been no material changes to the information included under Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. 38 I tem 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of April 3, 2020, the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 3, 2020. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended April 3, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our employees are now working from home, while also under shelter-in-place orders or other restrictions. Established business continuity plans were activated in order to mitigate the impact to our control environment, operating procedures, data and internal controls. The design of our processes and controls allow for remote execution with accessibility to secure data. These changes have not materially affected, and we do not believe are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 39 PART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s risk factors are described in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors included in our Annual Report. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the related length of its impact on the global economy, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to further adversely impact our business and results of operations. In December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus has been declared a pandemic and has spread across the world, including throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant adverse impact, both direct and indirect, on our businesses and the economy. We have experienced weakened demand from certain customers in the advanced industrial and medical end-markets, which has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our revenues. For example, healthcare providers have deferred elective medical procedures in order to focus on combatting the pandemic, which has significantly reduced demand for certain of our medical products. Certain other customers are delaying their research and development programs, which has negatively affected the demand for some of our products. If these trends continue, our revenues will continue to be negatively impacted. We have also faced difficulty sourcing some materials and components necessary to fulfill production requirements and meeting scheduled shipments due to shipping and transportation disruptions. If these disruptions were to worsen, our ability to manufacture our products or meet our customers’ schedules may be adversely affected and our business would be harmed. Even if we are able to find alternate sources of supply for such materials or components, they may cost more or be of lower quality, which could affect our profitability, financial condition and business. While the impact of the pandemic on our manufacturing capabilities has been limited to date, there can be no assurance that our ability to manufacture our products will not be disrupted in the future, due to sickness of employees, mandatory stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, supply interruptions or other potential disruptions. We have also faced and may face in the future limitations on our employee resources as a results of various causes, including stay-at-home orders from local governments, mandatory furloughs for one week per quarter for substantially all non-manufacturing employees, sickness of employees or their families, or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people. The pandemic has also diverted management resources and the prolonged work-from-home arrangements have created business continuity and increased cybersecurity risks. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, liquidity and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the continued geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States, the European Union, China and other countries, the duration and extent of business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease. If we or our customers experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions beyond current expectations, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and within planned timelines could be materially adversely impacted, and our business and financial results may continue to be adversely affected. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets, which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets. 40 I tem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds The following table sets forth certain information with respect to repurchases of the Company’s common stock during the three months ended April 3, 2020.

In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. The shares may be repurchased from time to time, at the Company's discretion, based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company's common shares, and general market conditions. No time limit was set for the completion of the share repurchase programs, and the programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has temporarily suspended the share repurchase plans. (2) The Company has repurchased 184,512 shares of its common shares pursuant to the 2018 Repurchase Plan since its adoption.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). ASU 2018-15 should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 on a prospective basis during the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 shall be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effects of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Reform Act is recognized. January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 during the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses of financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements. 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 during the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in the recording of additional operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $ 35.3 million and $ 36.5 million, respectively, as of January 1 , 2019. The adoption of ASU 201 6 -0 2 did not have an impact on the Company’s a ccumulated deficit , consolidated statement of operations, or consolidated statement of cash flows. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize revenue. As of September 27, 2019 and December 31, 2018, contract liabilities were $ 4.9 million and $ 4.7 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the nine months ended September 27, 2019 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, partially offset by $ 3.7 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2018. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 17 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 3. Business Combinations Acquisitions On July 31, 2019 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”), a Wackersdorf, Germany-based manufacturer of innovative laser scanning subsystems used in industrial materials processing and medical applications, for a total purchase price of € 65.5 million ($ 72.9 million), subject to customary working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 24.0 million ($ 26.7 million) cash paid at closing, 124 thousand Novanta common shares issued upon closing (with a fair market value of € 9.8 million, or $ 10.9 million, based on the closing market price of $ 87.58 per share on July 30, 2019), € 7.1 million ($7.9 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration and € 24.7 million ($ 27.4 million) deferred cash consideration, which is expected to be paid on June 29, 2020. The contingent consideration payments will be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from August 2019 through December 2026, with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The addition of ARGES complements and expands the Company’s existing portfolio of lasers and laser beam steering solutions capabilities within the Photonics reportable segment. On June 5, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Med X Change, Inc. (“Med X Change”), a Bradenton, Florida-based provider of medical grade, high definition and 4K video recording and documentation solutions to OEMs in the medical market. The purchase price of $ 21.9 million, net of working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and $ 21.0 million borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The addition of Med X Change complements and broadens the range of technology capabilities within the Company’s Vision reportable segment by providing its medical OEM customers with more integrated operating room solutions. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Ingenia-CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”), a Barcelona, Spain-based provider of high-performance servo drives and control software to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of € 14.3 million ($ 16.2 million), net of working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 8.5 million ($ 9.6 million) of cash consideration and € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration payments will be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from April 2019 through March 2022, with the first payment due in the second quarter of 2020. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. The initial cash purchase price was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The Ingenia purchase and sale agreement requires € 0.8 million ($ 0.9 million) of the purchase price to be held back by the Company for indemnification of certain representations and warranties claims by the Company until the 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) expiration of the holdback agreement in October 2021 . The addition of Ingenia enhances the Company’s strategic position in the precision motion control industry by enabling it to offer a broader range of motion control technologies and integrated solutions. Ingenia is included in the Company’s Precision Motion reportable segment. Allocation of Purchase Price The acquisitions of ARGES, Med X Change and Ingenia have been accounted for as business combinations. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions developed by management. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. The Company’s estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as a result of additional information obtained with regards to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. ARGES Based upon a preliminary valuation, the total purchase price for ARGES was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 3,159 Accounts receivable 1,542 Inventories 8,295 Property, plant and equipment 13,884 Intangible assets 24,713 Goodwill 42,355 Other assets 1,990 Total assets acquired 95,938 Accounts payable 2,598 Deferred tax liabilities 7,457 Other liabilities 12,954 Total liabilities assumed 23,009 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 72,929 Less: cash acquired 3,159 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired 69,770 Less: contingent consideration 7,870 Less: issuance of common shares 10,900 Less: deferred cash consideration 27,442 Net cash used for acquisition of business $ 23,558 The purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Company is in the process of collecting additional information for the valuation of inventories, intangible assets, contingent consideration and unrecognized tax benefits. 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) The fair value of intangible assets for ARGES is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 11,355 15 years Customer relationships 11,800 15 years Trademarks and trade names 1,225 10 years Backlog 333 5 months Total $ 24,713 The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 24.7 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 42.4 million of goodwill. As the ARGES acquisition is an acquisition of outstanding common shares, none of the resulting goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) ARGES’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) ARGES’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of ARGES’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of ARGES were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on July 31, 2019. ARGES contributed revenues of $ 1.9 million and a loss before income taxes of $ 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019. Loss before income taxes for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $ 0.9 million. The pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of ARGES, as if it had been acquired as of January 1, 2018, would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported for the year ended December 31, 2018. Med X Change and Ingenia Based upon a preliminary valuation, the total purchase price for Med X Change and Ingenia was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 1,000 Accounts receivable 1,739 Inventories 2,372 Property, plant and equipment 496 Intangible assets 22,376 Goodwill 13,539 Other assets 601 Total assets acquired 42,123 Accounts payable 604 Deferred tax liabilities 2,550 Other liabilities 910 Total liabilities assumed 4,064 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 38,059 Less: cash acquired 1,000 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired 37,059 Less: contingent consideration 6,569 Less: purchase price holdback 905 Net cash used for acquisition of businesses $ 29,585 11 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) The purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Company is in the process of collecting additional information for the valuation of unrecognized tax benefits. The fair value of intangible assets for Med X Change and Ingenia is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 11,072 10 years Customer relationships 10,465 15 years Trademarks and trade names 639 9 years Backlog 200 7 months Total $ 22,376 The Company recorded an aggregate of $ 22.4 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 13.5 million of goodwill from these acquisitions. Goodwill amounting to $ 6.2 million from the Med X Change acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) their ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) their ability to grow business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of Med X Change and Ingenia operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of Med X Change and Ingenia were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions contributed revenues of $ 4.0 million and a loss before income taxes of $ 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019. Loss before income taxes for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $ 1.0 million. The pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of Med X Change and Ingenia, as if they had been acquired as of January 1, 2018, would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported for the year ended December 31, 2018. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs are included in restructuring and acquisition related costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs for ARGES, Ingenia and Med X Change were $ 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019. 4. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Income (Loss) Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2018 $ ( 22,527 ) $ ( 12,485 ) $ ( 10,042 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 2,831 ) ( 3,144 ) 313 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (1) 747 — 747 Balance at September 27, 2019 $ ( 24,611 ) $ ( 15,629 ) $ ( 8,982 ) (1) The amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 12 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) 5. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Novanta Inc., after redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company recognized changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value by adjusting the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest as of the end of the applicable period to the higher of: (i) the estimated redemption value assuming the end of the period was also the redemption date or (ii) the carrying value without any redemption value adjustments. Such adjustments were recorded in retained earnings in stockholders’ equity instead of net income attributable to Novanta Inc. For both basic and diluted earnings per common share, such redemption value adjustments were included in the calculation of the numerator. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator also includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019 and September 28, 2018, respectively, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per common share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units and the 2017 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum noncontrolling interest shareholders, as well as the 2018 and 2019 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units will be included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 27, September 28, September 27, September 28, 2019 (1) 2018 (2) 2019 (1) 2018 (2) Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 8,923 $ 14,989 $ 31,556 $ 39,451 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — ( 435 ) — ( 1,986 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. 8,923 14,554 31,556 37,465 Redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment — 6,877 — 1,781 Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. after adjustment for redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value $ 8,923 $ 21,431 $ 31,556 $ 39,246 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,074 34,899 35,012 34,918 Dilutive potential common shares 511 586 511 551 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,585 35,485 35,523 35,469 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 35 — 43 — Earnings per Common Share Attributable to Novanta Inc.: Basic $ 0.25 $ 0.61 $ 0.90 $ 1.12 Diluted $ 0.25 $ 0.60 $ 0.89 $ 1.11 (1) 47,147 performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213,219 shares of restricted stock issued to Laser Quantum former non-controlling interest holders are considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of September 27, 2019. (2) 53,968 performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213,219 shares of restricted stock issued to Laser Quantum former non-controlling interest holders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of September 28, 2018. 13 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) 6. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring and acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. There have been no changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration since the acquisition date. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring and acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. There have been no changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration since the acquisition date. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the asset acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying 14 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) asset. Based on revenue performance as of September 27, 2019 and the most recent revenue project ions for the remainder of 2019 and fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to $ 4.7 million as of September 27, 2019 . Summary by Fair Value Hierarchy The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 27, 2019 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Significant Other Active Markets for Significant Other Unobservable Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 3,439 $ 3,439 $ — $ — Prepaid expenses and other current assets: Foreign currency forward contracts 354 — 354 — $ 3,793 $ 3,439 $ 354 $ — Liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: Contingent considerations - Current $ 3,769 $ — $ — $ 3,769 Foreign currency forward contracts 21 — 21 — Other liabilities: Contingent considerations - Long-term 14,998 — — 14,998 $ 18,788 $ — $ 21 $ 18,767 The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Significant Other Active Markets for Significant Other Unobservable Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 4,288 $ 4,288 $ — $ — Prepaid expenses and other current assets: Foreign currency forward contracts 15 — 15 — $ 4,303 $ 4,288 $ 15 $ — Liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: Foreign currency forward contracts $ 182 $ — $ 182 $ — Other liabilities: Contingent considerations - Long-term 3,376 — — 3,376 $ 3,558 $ — $ 182 $ 3,376 15 NOVANTA INC.

See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt. 7. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. The Company uses forward contracts as a part of its strategy to limit its exposures related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These forward contracts are not 16 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) designated as cash flow, fair v alue or net investment hedges. All c hanges in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in income before income taxes . As of September 27, 2019, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 29.1 million and a net gain of $ 0.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 31.2 million and a net loss of $ 0.2 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net gain of $ 0.7 million and $ 1.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, respectively, and an aggregate net loss of $ 0.2 million and an aggregate net gain of $ 0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances annually for impairment as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2019 and noted no impairment.

The Third Amendment increased the revolving credit facility under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 100 million, from $ 225 million to $ 325 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $ 125 million for potential future expansion. Additionally, the Third Amendment increased the term loan balance from $ 65.6 million to $ 90.6 million. Under the Third Amendment, the Company is required to pay quarterly scheduled principal repayments of $ 2.3 million beginning in October 2017, with the final installment of $ 56.1 million due upon maturity in May 2021 . The Company borrowed $ 66.8 million under the revolving credit facility in the nine months ended September 27, 2019 to fund the acquisition of Ingenia, Med X Change and ARGES. The Company repaid $ 40.8 million of its term loan and revolving credit facility in the nine months ended September 27, 2019. In February 2018, the Company entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio from 3.00 to 3.50 , increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for permitted acquisitions and stock repurchases from 2.50 to 3.00 , increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for a designated acquisition from 3.00 to 3.50 , and increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition from 3.50 to 4.00 . The Fourth Amendment also made certain other technical changes to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 27, 2019. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc., Novanta Corporation, NDS Surgical Imaging LLC, Novanta Europe GmbH, Novanta UK Investments Holding Limited and Novanta Technologies UK Limited. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Fair Value of Debt As of September 27, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 20 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) 11. Leases The Company leases certain equipment and facilities. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of these leases include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance or other property management costs). The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components separately. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. Most leases held by the Company expire between 2019 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include terms such as an option to purchase the property, one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination option is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable life of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements is limited to the expected lease terms. Most leases held by the Company do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate for the same jurisdiction and term as the associated lease based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. The Company has a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, the Company applies a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment. The following table summarizes the components of lease costs (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 27, September 27, 2019 2019 Operating lease cost $ 1,830 $ 5,695 Finance lease cost Amortization of right-of-use assets 228 583 Interest on lease liabilities 110 316 Variable lease cost 505 1,051 Total lease cost $ 2,673 $ 7,645 21 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) 12. Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Common Share Repurchases In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the nine months ended September 27, 2019, the Company repurchased 81 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 6.7 million at an average price of $ 82.83 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 27, September 28, September 27, September 28, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Selling, general and administrative $ 1,926 $ 1,523 $ 6,546 $ 5,021 Research and development and engineering 171 114 466 306 Cost of revenue 146 58 336 148 Total share-based compensation expense $ 2,243 $ 1,695 $ 7,348 $ 5,475 Share-based compensation reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 0.9 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2019. Share-based compensation reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 28, 2018. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 187 thousand and 179 thousand DSUs outstanding as of September 27, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 27, 2019: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2018 529 $ 26.98 Granted 111 $ 75.93 Vested ( 170 ) $ 27.34 Forfeited ( 23 ) $ 48.01 Unvested at September 27, 2019 447 $ 37.87 Expected to vest as of September 27, 2019 427 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 27, 2019 was $ 13.2 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. 24 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) Performance Stock Units The Company granted two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the nine months ended September 27, 2019: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2018 137 $ 37.28 Granted 46 $ 92.63 Performance adjustment (1) 29 $ 14.13 Vested ( 59 ) $ 14.13 Forfeited — $ — Unvested at September 27, 2019 153 $ 57.92 Expected to vest as of September 27, 2019 150 (1) Represents adjustment for performance-based awards granted on March 30, 2016. These units vested at 200 % during the nine months ended September 27, 2019 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS during the performance period of fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the nine months ended September 27, 2019 was $ 5.0 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte-Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Nine Months Ended September 27, 2019 Grant-date stock price $ 77.23 Expected volatility 32.54 % Risk-free interest rate 2.46 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 108.58 25 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) Stock Options The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions include the expected option term, the expected volatility of the common shares over the expected term of the option, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. Compensation expense related to stock options is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. No stock options were granted during the nine months ended September 27, 2019. The total fair value of stock options that exercised during the nine months ended September 27, 2019, based on the difference between market price on the date of exercise and the date of grant, was $ 2.4 million. The total amount of cash received from the exercise of these stock options was $ 0.4 million. There were 73 thousand stock options outstanding as of September 27, 2019. 13. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of 18.8 % for the three months ended September 27, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. The Company’s effective tax rate of 12.9 % for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period. The Company’s effective tax rate of 19.5 % for the three months ended September 28, 2018 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits; offset by non-deductible expenses recognized under an earn-out agreement in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Zettlex Holdings Limited (“Zettlex”) in 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate of 17.3 % for the nine months ended September 28, 2018 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period; offset by non-deductible expenses recognized under an earn-out agreement in connection with the Zettlex acquisition. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on some of its deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 26 NOVANTA INC.

The majority of acquisition related costs for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019 were included in the Company’s Precision Motion and Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services reportable segments. 15. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2018. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. 28 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 (Unaudited) Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which they are involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 16. Related Party Transactions As of March 29, 2019, certain members of the Company’s board of directors served on the board of directors or as advisors of companies that are customers of the Company. All contracts with these related parties were executed at arm’s length in the ordinary course of business. As of the beginning of the second quarter of 2019, these customers were no longer considered to be related parties. The aggregate revenue from these customers was $ 11.6 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019. The aggregate revenue from these customers was $ 8.5 million and $ 20.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively. 17. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.

Vision segment gross profit margin was 38.7% for the nine months ended 37 September 27, 2019 , versus a gross profit margin of 37.4 % for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to changes in product mix . Precision Motion Precision Motion segment gross profit for the three months ended September 27, 2019 decreased $4.3 million, or 25.5%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in revenue and a decrease in gross profit margin. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 42.3% for the three months ended September 27, 2019, versus a gross profit margin of 44.9% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to business volume reductions that could not be fully compensated by cost reduction initiatives.

Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 43.0% for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus a gross profit margin of 45.3% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to business volume reductions that could not be fully compensated by cost reduction initiatives and an increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of developed technology of $0.4 million, which resulted in a 0.4 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expenses for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 27, September 28, September 27, September 28, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Research and development and engineering $ 13,811 $ 13,204 $ 41,196 $ 37,744 Selling, general and administrative 27,926 29,147 88,977 87,598 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 3,970 3,947 11,740 11,538 Restructuring and acquisition related costs 5,546 2,341 11,913 4,805 Total $ 51,253 $ 48,639 $ 153,826 $ 141,685 Research and Development and Engineering Expenses R&D expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. R&D expenses were $13.8 million, or 9.0% of revenue, during the three months ended September 27, 2019, versus $13.2 million, or 8.2% of revenue, during the prior year period. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to R&D expenses from current year acquisitions. R&D expenses were $41.2 million, or 8.8% of revenue, during the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus $37.7 million, or 8.2% of revenue, during the prior year period.

Restructuring and Acquisition Related Costs We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $5.5 million during the three months ended September 27, 2019, versus $2.3 million during the prior year period. The increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs versus the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in restructuring charges of $1.3 million as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs and an increase in acquisition related costs of $1.9 million primarily related to professional services fees for acquisitions. We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $11.9 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus $4.8 million during the prior year period. The increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs versus the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in restructuring charges of $3.7 million as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs and an increase in acquisition related costs of $3.4 million primarily related to professional services fees for acquisitions. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 27, September 28, September 27, September 28, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 10,661 $ 14,595 $ 34,637 $ 46,102 Vision 5,830 5,380 14,602 6,246 Precision Motion 5,221 8,818 16,839 25,037 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (8,911 ) (7,798 ) (23,779 ) (22,048 ) Total $ 12,801 $ 20,995 $ 42,299 $ 55,337 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $10.7 million, or 19.5% of revenue, during the three months ended September 27, 2019, versus $14.6 million, or 23.8% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $3.9 million. Photonics segment operating income was $34.6 million, or 20.1% of revenue, during the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus $46.1 million, or 24.6% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $9.6 million and an increase in restructuring related charges of $2.0 million associated with the 2019 restructuring program. Vision Vision segment operating income was $5.8 million, or 8.3% of revenue, during the three months ended September 27, 2019, versus $5.4 million, or 8.7% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $2.8 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.3 million and an increase in restructuring related charges of $0.6 million associated with the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs. Vision segment operating income was $14.6 million, or 7.2% of revenue, during the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus $6.2 million, or 3.6% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $13.8 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses of $3.6 million and an increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $1.4 million associated with the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs and professional services fees for acquisitions. 39 Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $5.2 million, or 17.7% of revenue, during the three months ended September 27, 2019, versus $8.8 million, or 23.6% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $4.3 million, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition related costs. Precision Motion segment operating income was $16.8 million, or 18.2% of revenue, during the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus $25.0 million, or 25.3% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $5.0 million and an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses of $3.3 million. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs. These costs for the three months ended September 27, 2019 increased by $1.1 million versus the prior year period primarily due to an increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $2.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses of $1.6 million. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 increased by $1.7 million versus the prior year period primarily due to an increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $4.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses of $2.4 million. Other Income and Expense Items The following table sets forth other income and expense items for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 27, September 28, September 27, September 28, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Interest income (expense), net $ (2,153 ) $ (2,396 ) $ (6,357 ) $ (7,315 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net 387 66 455 (164 ) Other income (expense), net (48 ) (44 ) (186 ) (131 ) Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $2.2 million for the three months ended September 27, 2019, versus $2.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 3.13% during the three months ended September 27, 2019, versus 3.49% during the three months ended September 28, 2018. Net interest expense was $6.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus $7.3 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 3.46% during the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus 3.55% during the nine months ended September 28, 2018. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $0.4 million net gains for the three months ended September 27, 2019, versus less than $0.1 million net gains in the prior year period. The increase in net gains was due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Euro and realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were $0.5 million net gains for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus $0.2 million net losses in the prior year period, primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Euro and unrealized gains from foreign currency contracts. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal for both the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, respectively, and the three and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively. 40 Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 27, 2019 was 18.8%, versus 19.5% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 18.8% for the three months ended September 27, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 was 12.9%, versus 17.3% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 12.9% for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions, other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain share-based compensation awards during the period. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest expense. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of September 27, 2019, $37.1 million of our $61.4 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Approximately 74.6% of our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities was held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. Share Repurchase Plan In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of our common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the nine months ended September 27, 2019, we repurchased 81 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $6.7 million at an average price of $82.83 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. We had $18.3 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of September 27, 2019. Under the 2018 Repurchase Plan, shares may be repurchased from time to time, at our discretion, based on our ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The 2018 Repurchase Plan does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of our common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund the share repurchases through cash on hand and future cash generated from operations. 41 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement In May 2016, we entered into the second amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), consisting of a $75.0 million, 5-year term loan facility and a $225.0 million, 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in May 2021. In August 2017, we entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment increased the borrowing limit under the revolving credit facility commitment from $225 million to $325 million and reset the accordion feature to $125 million for future expansion. Additionally, the Third Amendment increased the term loan balance from $65.6 million to $90.6 million. In February 2018, we entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio from 3.00 to 3.50, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for permitted acquisitions and stock repurchases from 2.50 to 3.00, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for a designated acquisition from 3.00 to 3.50, and increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition from 3.50 to 4.00. The Fourth Amendment also made certain other technical changes to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of September 27, 2019, we had term loans of $56.1 million and revolving loans of $172.8 million outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of September 27, 2019: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.84 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 5.41 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 27, 2019 and September 28, 2018 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 27, September 28, 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 27,843 $ 67,720 Net cash used in investing activities $ (61,052 ) $ (42,257 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 12,379 $ (12,274 ) September 27, December 31, 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 61,405 $ 82,043 Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility $ 152,153 $ 189,942 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $27.8 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, versus $67.7 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to increases in the net working capital in the nine months ended September 27, 2019 which decreased cash provided by operating activities by $39.9 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding which increased from 51 days at December 31, 2018 to 59 days at September 27, 2019 primarily due to poor sales linearity, a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 52 days at December 31, 2018 to 48 days at September 27, 2019 and an increase in inventories. Our inventory turnover ratio decreased from 3.4 at December 31, 2018 to 3.2 at September 27, 2019. During the nine months ended September 27, 2019, we paid the first milestone payment under the earn-out 42 agreement for the Zettlex acquisition amounting to $3.9 million and paid the 2018 annual employee bonuses, both of which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2018 was positively impacted by an increase in our days payables outstanding, which increased from 43 days at December 31, 2017 to 48 days at September 28, 2018, and an increase in accrued expenses. The Company’s growth in revenue of $83.8 million and gross profit of $38.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2017 increased our outstanding trade receivables and inventories, which negatively impacted our cash provided by operating activities. During the nine months ended September 28, 2018, we paid $2.8 million as the final contingent consideration payment for our acquisition of Applimotion Inc., which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2017. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $61.1 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, primarily driven by the Ingenia and Med X Change acquisitions and the initial purchase price for the ARGES acquisition. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid $53.1 million cash considerations (net of cash acquired of $4.2 million) during the nine months ended September 27, 2019. We also paid $8.0 million for capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 27, 2019. Cash used in investing activities was $42.3 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2018, primarily related to $29.6 million cash outflows (net of cash acquired of $3.8 million) related to 2018 acquisitions, $1.2 million in cash paid to acquire customer relationship assets, and $11.6 million in capital expenditures. Financing Cash Flows Cash provided by financing activities was $12.4 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, primarily due to $66.8 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the Ingenia, Med X Change and ARGES acquisitions, partially offset by $40.8 million in repayments of our term loan and revolving credit facility, $6.8 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, and $6.7 million of repurchases of common shares. Cash used in financing activities was $12.3 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2018, primarily due to $30.8 million of cash consideration paid for the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum, $9.2 million of term loan payments, $19.9 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $3.5 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $3.8 million of repurchases of common shares, partially offset by $55.3 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Zettlex and the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the principal and interest associated with our debt, finance leases, purchase commitments and pension obligations. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the contractual obligations related to current year acquisitions, through September 27, 2019, we have not entered into any other material new or modified contractual obligations since the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 . 43 The following table summarizes contractual obligations at September 27, 2019 related to current year acquisitions (in thousands): Contractual Obligations Total 2019 (remainder of year) 2020 - 2021 2022 - 2023 Thereafter Finance leases (1) $ 9,098 $ 185 $ 8,913 $ — $ — Purchase commitments (2) 2,242 1,878 364 — — Contingent considerations (3) 14,106 — 5,298 4,452 4,356 Deferred cash considerations (4) 28,036 — 28,036 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 53,482 $ 2,063 $ 42,611 $ 4,452 $ 4,356 (1) Future minimum lease payments under finance lease include the expected price to purchase a facility in Germany during the year ending December 31, 2020.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 28, 2019 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 6 Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). ASU 2018-15 should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 on a prospective basis during the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 shall be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effects of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Reform Act is recognized. January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 during the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 during the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in the recording of additional operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $ 35.3 million and $ 36.5 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 did not have an impact on the Company’s Accumulated deficit, consolidated statement of operations, or consolidated statement of cash flows. 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. 7 Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize revenue. As of June 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, contract liabilities were $ 2.9 million and $ 4.7 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the six months ended June 28, 2019 is primarily due to $ 3.2 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2018, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 17 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 8 3. Business Combinations Med X Change On June 5, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Med X Change, Inc. (“Med X Change”), a Bradenton, Florida-based provider of medical grade, high definition and 4K video recording and documentation solutions to OEMs in the medical market. The purchase price of $ 21.8 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and a $ 21.0 million draw-down on the Company’s revolving credit facility. The addition of Med X Change complements and broadens the range of technology capabilities within the Company’s Vision reportable segment by providing its medical OEM customers with more integrated operating room solutions. Ingenia On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Ingenia-CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”), a Barcelona, Spain-based provider of high-performance servo drives and control software to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets. The purchase price of € 14.3 million ($ 16.2 million), subject to working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes € 8.5 million ($ 9.6 million) of cash consideration and € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) in estimated fair value of contingent consideration payable upon the achievement of certain revenue targets from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. The Ingenia purchase and sale agreement requires € 0.9 million ($ 1.0 million) of the purchase price to be held by the Company which can be utilized as indemnification for certain representations and warranties claims by the Company until the expiration of the holdback agreement in October 2021 . The addition of Ingenia enhances the Company’s strategic position in precision motion control industry by enabling it to offer a broader range of motion control technologies and integrated solutions. Ingenia is included in the Company’s Precision Motion reportable segment. Allocation of Purchase Price The acquisitions of Med X Change and Ingenia have been accounted for as business combinations. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions developed by management. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. The Company’s estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as a result of additional information obtained with regards to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Company is in the process of collecting additional information for the valuation of intangible assets, contingent consideration and unrecognized tax benefits. 9 Based upon a preliminary valuation, the total purchase price for Med X Change and Ingenia was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 1,000 Accounts receivable 1,739 Inventories 2,372 Property, plant and equipment 565 Intangible assets 22,376 Goodwill 13,394 Other assets 601 Total assets acquired 42,047 Accounts payable 604 Deferred tax liabilities 2,550 Other liabilities 910 Total liabilities assumed 4,064 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 37,983 Less: cash acquired 1,000 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired 36,983 Less: contingent consideration 6,569 Less: purchase price holdback 961 Less: working capital adjustment 569 Net cash used for acquisition of businesses $ 28,884 The fair value of intangible assets for Med X Change and Ingenia is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 11,072 10 years Customer relationships 10,465 15 years Trademarks and trade names 639 9 years Backlog 200 7 months Total $ 22,376 The Company recorded an aggregate of $ 22.4 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 13.4 million of goodwill from these acquisitions. Goodwill amounting to $ 6.0 million from the Med X Change acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) their ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) their ability to grow business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of Med X Change and Ingenia operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of Med X Change and Ingenia were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions contributed revenues of $ 1.0 million and a loss before income taxes of $ 0.5 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019. Loss before income taxes for the six months ended June 28, 2019 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $ 0.4 million. The pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of Med X Change and Ingenia, as if they had been acquired as of January 1, 2018, would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported for the year ended December 31, 2018. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs are included in restructuring and acquisition related costs in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs for Ingenia and Med X Change were $ 0.5 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019. 10 4. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Income (Loss) Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2018 $ ( 22,527 ) $ ( 12,485 ) $ ( 10,042 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 254 ) ( 323 ) 69 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (1) 501 — 501 Balance at June 28, 2019 $ ( 22,280 ) $ ( 12,808 ) $ ( 9,472 ) (1) The amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 5. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Novanta Inc., after redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company recognized changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value by adjusting the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest as of the end of the applicable period to the higher of: (i) the estimated redemption value assuming the end of the period was also the redemption date or (ii) the carrying value without any redemption value adjustments. Such adjustments were recorded in retained earnings in stockholders’ equity instead of net income attributable to Novanta Inc. For both basic and diluted earnings per common share, such redemption value adjustments were included in the calculation of the numerator. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator also includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. For the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018, respectively, weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share included the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units and the 2017 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum noncontrolling interest shareholders, as well as the 2018 and 2019 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units will be included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved. 11 The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (amounts in thousands, except per share data): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 28, June 29, June 28, June 29, 2019 (1) 2018 (2) 2019 (1) 2018 (2) Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 10,380 $ 11,625 $ 22,633 $ 24,462 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — ( 625 ) — ( 1,551 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. 10,380 11,000 22,633 22,911 Redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment — 303 — ( 5,096 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. after adjustment for redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value $ 10,380 $ 11,303 $ 22,633 $ 17,815 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 34,998 34,949 34,981 34,919 Dilutive potential common shares 505 525 510 532 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,503 35,474 35,491 35,451 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 36 — 47 6 Earnings per Common Share Attributable to Novanta Inc.: Basic $ 0.30 $ 0.32 $ 0.65 $ 0.51 Diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.32 $ 0.64 $ 0.50 (1) 45,252 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213,219 shares of restricted stock issued to Laser Quantum former non-controlling interest holders are considered contingently issuable shares and are excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of June 28, 2019. (2) 53,968 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of June 29, 2018. 6. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. 12 Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts is reported either in other current assets or in other current liabilities as of the end of the period. Contingent Considerations On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia-CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring and acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. There have been no changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration since the acquisition date. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets from 2018 to 2021 by the Company from products using such technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If such targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the asset acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset. Based on revenue performance as of June 28, 2019 and the most recent revenue projections for the remainder of 2019 and fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to $ 3.9 million as of June 28, 2019. Summary by Fair Value Hierarchy The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 28, 2019 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Significant Other Active Markets for Significant Other Unobservable Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 3,184 $ 3,184 $ — $ — Prepaid expenses and other current assets: Foreign currency forward contracts 47 — 47 — $ 3,231 $ 3,184 $ 47 $ — Liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: Contingent consideration - Current $ 3,091 $ — $ — $ 3,091 Foreign currency forward contracts 31 — 31 — Other liabilities: Contingent consideration - Long-term 7,436 — — 7,436 $ 10,558 $ — $ 31 $ 10,527 13 The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Significant Other Active Markets for Significant Other Unobservable Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 4,288 $ 4,288 $ — $ — Prepaid expenses and other current assets: Foreign currency forward contracts 15 — 15 — $ 4,303 $ 4,288 $ 15 $ — Liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: Foreign currency forward contracts $ 182 $ — $ 182 $ — Other liabilities: Contingent consideration - Long-term 3,376 — — 3,376 $ 3,558 $ — $ 182 $ 3,376 Changes in the fair value of Level 3 contingent consideration during the six months ended June 28, 2019 were as follows (in thousands): Contingent Consideration Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 3,376 Acquisition of Ingenia 6,569 Fair value adjustments 547 Effect of foreign exchange rates 35 Balance at June 28, 2019 $ 10,527 The following table provides quantitative information associated with the fair value measurement of the Company’s Level 3 liabilities: Liability June 28, 2019 Fair Value (in thousands) Valuation Technique Unobservable Inputs Percentage Applied Contingent consideration (Ingenia) $ 6,604 Monte Carlo method Historical and projected revenues from April 2019 through March 2022 N/A Revenue volatility 31.3 % Cost of debt 1.0 % Revenue discount rate 14.3 % Contingent consideration (Other) $ 3,923 Discounted cash flow method Historical and projected revenues for fiscal years 2018 to 2021 N/A Discount rate 22.8 % Increases or decreases in the unobservable inputs noted above would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt. 7. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative 14 transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposure s to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions . The Company uses forward contracts as a part of its strategy to limit its exposures related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These forward contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. All changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in income before income taxes. As of June 28, 2019, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 31.2 million and a net gain of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 31.2 million and a net loss of $ 0.2 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net gain of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.9 million for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, and an aggregate net gain of $ 0.2 million and $ 0.9 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 29, 2018. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests its goodwill balances annually for impairment as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company performed the most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2019 and noted no impairment of goodwill. The following table summarizes changes in goodwill during the six months ended June 28, 2019 (in thousands): Balance at beginning of the period $ 217,662 Goodwill acquired from acquisitions 13,394 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes ( 685 ) Balance at end of the period $ 230,371 Goodwill by reportable segment as of June 28, 2019 was as follows (in thousands): Reportable Segment Photonics Vision Precision Motion Total Goodwill $ 168,698 $ 160,661 $ 52,241 $ 381,600 Accumulated impairment of goodwill ( 102,461 ) ( 31,722 ) ( 17,046 ) ( 151,229 ) Total $ 66,237 $ 128,939 $ 35,195 $ 230,371 Goodwill by reportable segment as of December 31, 2018 was as follows (in thousands): Reportable Segment Photonics Vision Precision Motion Total Goodwill $ 168,955 $ 155,017 $ 44,919 $ 368,891 Accumulated impairment of goodwill ( 102,461 ) ( 31,722 ) ( 17,046 ) ( 151,229 ) Total $ 66,494 $ 123,295 $ 27,873 $ 217,662 15 Intangible Assets Intangible assets as of June 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, are summarized as follows (in thousands): June 28, 2019 December 31, 2018 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Amortizable intangible assets: Patents and developed technologies $ 145,369 $ ( 91,250 ) $ 54,119 $ 134,034 $ ( 86,623 ) $ 47,411 Customer relationships 149,095 ( 70,733 ) 78,362 139,097 ( 64,174 ) 74,923 Customer backlog 1,925 ( 1,740 ) 185 1,738 ( 1,191 ) 547 Non-compete covenant — — — 2,514 ( 2,493 ) 21 Trademarks and trade names 16,509 ( 9,427 ) 7,082 15,915 ( 8,924 ) 6,991 Amortizable intangible assets 312,898 ( 173,150 ) 139,748 293,298 ( 163,405 ) 129,893 Non-amortizable intangible assets: Trade names 13,027 — 13,027 13,027 — 13,027 Totals $ 325,925 $ ( 173,150 ) $ 152,775 $ 306,325 $ ( 163,405 ) $ 142,920 All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized either on a straight-line basis or an economic benefit basis over their remaining estimated useful life. Amortization expense for patents and developed technologies is included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense for customer relationships and definite-lived trademarks, trade names and other intangibles is included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The Third Amendment increased the revolving credit facility under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 100 million, from $ 225 million to $ 325 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $ 125 million for potential future expansion. Additionally, the Third 17 Amendment increased the term loan balance from $ 65.6 million to $ 90.6 million. Under the Third Amendment, the Company is required to pay quarterly scheduled principal repayments of $ 2.3 million beginning in October 2017, with the final installment of $ 56.1 million due upon maturity in May 2021 . The Company borrowed $ 23.6 million under the revolving credit facility in the six months ended June 28, 2019 to fund the acquisition of Ingenia and Med X Change. The Company repaid $ 16.1 million of its term loan in the six months ended June 28, 2019. In February 2018, the Company entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio from 3.00 to 3.50 , increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for permitted acquisitions and stock repurchases from 2.50 to 3.00 , increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for a designated acquisition from 3.00 to 3.50 , and increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition from 3.50 to 4.00 . The Fourth Amendment also made certain other technical changes to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of June 28, 2019. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc., Novanta Corporation, NDS Surgical Imaging LLC, Novanta Europe GmbH, Novanta UK Investments Holding Limited and Novanta Technologies UK Limited. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Fair Value of Debt As of June 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 11. Leases The Company leases certain equipment and facilities. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of these leases include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance or other property management costs). The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components separately. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. Most leases held by the Company expire between 2019 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and some include options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination option is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable life of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements is limited to the expected lease terms. Most leases held by the Company do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate for the same jurisdiction and term as the associated lease based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. The Company has a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, the Company applies a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment. 18 The following table summarizes the components of lease costs (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 28, June 28, 2019 2019 Operating lease cost $ 2,042 $ 3,865 Finance lease cost Amortization of right-of-use assets 177 355 Interest on lease liabilities 101 206 Variable lease cost 408 546 Total lease cost $ 2,728 $ 4,972 The following table provides the details of balance sheet information related to leases (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate): June 28, 2019 Operating leases Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 38,633 Current portion of operating lease liabilities $ 5,225 Operating lease liabilities 35,108 Total operating lease liabilities $ 40,333 Finance leases Property, plant and equipment, gross $ 13,511 Accumulated depreciation ( 7,267 ) Property, plant and equipment, net $ 6,244 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 618 Other liabilities 6,764 Total finance lease liabilities $ 7,382 Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) Operating leases 10.8 Finance leases 9.8 Weighted-average discount rate Operating leases 5.71 % Finance leases 5.49 % The following table provides the details of cash flow information related to leases (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 28, 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in lease liabilities Operating cash flows from finance leases $ 294 Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 4,264 Financing cash flows from finance leases $ 283 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 5,471 19 Future minimum lease payments under operating and finance leases expiring subsequent to June 28, 2019, including operating leases associated with facilities that have been vacated as a result of the Company’s restructuring actions, are summarized as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December 31, Operating Lease Finance Lease 2019 (remainder of year) $ 3,878 $ 499 2020 6,240 980 2021 6,090 907 2022 5,340 907 2023 4,687 930 Thereafter 29,138 5,394 Total minimum lease payments 55,373 9,617 Less: Interest ( 15,040 ) ( 2,235 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 40,333 $ 7,382 Future minimum lease payments under operating and capital leases expiring subsequent to December 31, 2018 under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 840, “Leases”, including operating leases associated with facilities that have been vacated as a result of the Company’s restructuring actions, are summarized as follows (in thousands): Year Ending December 31, Operating Lease (1) Capital Lease 2019 $ 7,797 $ 990 2020 6,263 980 2021 5,757 907 2022 5,264 907 2023 4,719 930 Thereafter 26,149 5,394 Total minimum lease payments $ 55,949 $ 10,108 (1) Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2018 included common-area maintenance and other property management costs and tax obligations . 12. Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Common Share Repurchases In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. During the six months ended June 28, 2019, the Company repurchased 39 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 3.3 million at an average price of $ 84.75 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 28, June 29, June 28, June 29, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Selling, general and administrative $ 2,089 $ 1,574 $ 4,620 $ 3,498 Research and development and engineering 184 108 295 192 Cost of revenue 105 54 190 90 Total share-based compensation expense $ 2,378 $ 1,736 $ 5,105 $ 3,780 Share-based compensation reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 0.9 million during the six months ended June 28, 2019. Share-based compensation reported in selling, general and administrative expenses included expenses related to 20 deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors of $ 0.5 million during the six months ended June 29, 2018 . Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Compensation expense associated with DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as the DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 187 thousand and 179 thousand DSUs outstanding as of June 28, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended June 28, 2019: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2018 529 $ 26.98 Granted 103 $ 75.52 Vested ( 164 ) $ 27.37 Forfeited ( 20 ) $ 46.60 Unvested at June 28, 2019 448 $ 37.16 Expected to vest as of June 28, 2019 426 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the six months ended June 28, 2019 was $ 12.7 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company granted two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the performance targets established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common shares compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. 21 The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance-based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the six months ended June 28, 2019: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2018 137 $ 37.28 Granted 44 $ 92.93 Performance adjustment (1) 29 $ 14.13 Vested ( 59 ) $ 14.13 Forfeited — $ — Unvested at June 28, 2019 151 $ 57.57 Expected to vest as of June 28, 2019 137 (1) Represents adjustment for performance-based awards granted on March 30, 2016. These units vested at 200 % during the six months ended June 28, 2019 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS during the performance period of fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the six months ended June 28, 2019 was $ 5.0 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte-Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Six Months Ended June 28, 2019 Grant-date stock price $ 77.23 Expected volatility 32.54 % Risk-free interest rate 2.46 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 108.58 13. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0 % in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of 19.5 % for the three months ended June 28, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, and U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. The Company’s effective tax rate of 10.3 % for the six months ended June 28, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. The Company’s effective tax rate of 20.8 % for the three months ended June 29, 2018 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, and U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits; offset by non-deductible expenses recognized under an earn-out agreement in connection with the Zettlex acquisition. 22 The Company’s effective tax rate of 16.0 % for the six months ended June 29, 2018 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0 % primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain equity awards during the period; offset by non-deductible expenses recognized under an earn-out agreement in connection with the Zettlex acquisition . The Company maintains a valuation allowance on some of its deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 14.

The majority of acquisition related costs for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 were included in the Company’s Precision Motion and Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services reportable segments. 15. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2018. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by- 24 laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which he or she is involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 16. Related Party Transactions As of March 29, 2019, certain members of the Company’s board of directors served on the board of directors or as an advisor of companies that are customers of the Company. All contracts with these related parties were executed at arm’s length in the ordinary course of business. As of the beginning of the second quarter of 2019, these customers were no longer considered to be related parties. The aggregate revenue from these customers was $ 11.6 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019. The aggregate revenue from these customers was $ 8.5 million and $ 20.3 million for the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively. 17. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of, and allocates resources to, its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers. Based upon the information provided to the CODM, the Company has determined that it operates in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics The Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, continuous wave and ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Vision The Vision segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless imaging and operating room integration technologies; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies; and embedded touch screen solutions. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Precision Motion The Precision Motion segment designs, manufactures and markets optical and inductive encoders, precision motor and motion control sub-assemblies, servo drives, air bearings, air bearing spindles and precision machined components to customers worldwide. 25 The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers.

Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were less than $0.1 million net gains for the three months ended June 28, 2019, versus $0.2 million net gains in the prior year period. The decrease in net gains was due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Euro, partially offset by realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were less than $0.1 million net gains for the six months ended June 28, 2019, versus $0.2 million net losses in the prior year period, primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Euro. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal for both the three and six months ended June 28, 2019, respectively, and the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, respectively. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 28, 2019 was 19.5%, versus 20.8% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 19.5% for the three months ended June 28, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, and U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 28, 2019 was 10.3%, versus 16.0% for the prior year period. Our effective tax rate of 10.3% for the six months ended June 28, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest expense. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving 36 credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of June 28, 2019, $42.0 million of our $66.1 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Approximately 64.7% of our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities was held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. Share Repurchase Plan In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of our common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the six months ended June 28, 2019, we repurchased 39 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $3.3 million at an average price of $84.75 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. We had $21.7 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of June 28, 2019. Under the 2018 Repurchase Plan, shares may be repurchased from time to time, at our discretion, based on our ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be purchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The 2018 Repurchase Plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund the share repurchases through cash on hand and future cash generated from operations. Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement In May 2016, we entered into the second amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), consisting of a $75.0 million, 5-year term loan facility and a $225.0 million, 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in May 2021. In August 2017, we entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment increased the borrowing limit under the revolving credit facility commitment from $225 million to $325 million and reset the accordion feature to $125 million for future expansion. Additionally, the Third Amendment increased the term loan balance from $65.6 million to $90.6 million. In February 2018, we entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio from 3.00 to 3.50, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for permitted acquisitions and stock repurchases from 2.50 to 3.00, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for a designated acquisition from 3.00 to 3.50, and increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition from 3.50 to 4.00. The Fourth Amendment also made certain other technical changes to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of June 28, 2019, we had term loans of $58.4 million and revolving loans of $157.8 million outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 37 The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenant s and our compliance therewith as of June 28, 2019 : Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.72 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 5.52 Cash Flows for the Six Months Ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Six Months Ended June 28, June 29, 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 20,853 $ 40,365 Net cash used in investing activities $ (34,444 ) $ (34,632 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (2,798 ) $ 2,712 June 28, December 31, 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 66,093 $ 82,043 Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility $ 167,180 $ 189,942 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $20.9 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, versus $40.4 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 28, 2019 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to increases in the net working capital in the six months ended June 28, 2019 which decreased cash provided by operating activities by $25.9 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 28, 2019 was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding which increased from 51 days at December 31, 2018 to 52 days at June 28, 2019, a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 52 days at December 31, 2018 to 51 days at June 28, 2019 and an increase in inventories, as our inventory turnover ratio decreased from 3.4 at December 31, 2018 to 3.2 at June 28, 2019. During the six months ended June 28, 2019, we paid the first milestone payment under the Zettlex earn-out agreement amounting to $3.9 million and paid the 2018 annual employee bonuses, both of which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 29, 2018 was positively impacted by a decrease in our days sales outstanding which decreased from 51 days at December 31, 2017 to 46 days at June 29, 2018 and by an increase in our days payables outstanding which increased from 43 days at December 31, 2017 to 45 days at June 29, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in inventories, as our inventory turnover ratio decreased from 3.7 at December 31, 2017 to 3.5 at June 29, 2018, a decrease in accrued expenses and an increase in income tax payments. During the six months ended June 29, 2018, we paid $2.8 million as the final Applimotion contingent consideration payment which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2017. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $34.4 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, primarily driven by the Ingenia and Med X Change acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid $28.9 million cash considerations (net of cash acquired of $1.0 million) during the six months ended June 28, 2019. We also paid $5.6 million for capital expenditures during the six months ended June 28, 2019. Cash used in investing activities was $34.6 million for the six months ended June 29, 2018, primarily related to $27.4 million cash outflows (net of cash acquired of $3.8 million) related to the Zettlex acquisition in May 2018 and $7.3 million in capital expenditures. 38 Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $2.8 million for the six months ended June 28, 2019, primarily due to $16.1 million of term loan payments, $6.7 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards, and $3.3 million of repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $23.6 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the Ingenia and Med X Change acquisitions. Cash provided by financing activities was $2.7 million for the six months ended June 29, 2018, primarily due to $30.3 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the Zettlex acquisition, partially offset by $4.6 million of contractual term loan payments, $17.2 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $3.4 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of stock-based compensation awards, and $1.9 million of repurchases of common stock. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations primarily consist of the principal and interest associated with our debt, operating and finance leases, purchase commitments and pension obligations. Such contractual obligations are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through June 28, 2019, we have not entered into any other off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with any unconsolidated entities or other persons. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The critical accounting policies that we believe impact significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements presented in this periodic report on Form 10-Q are described in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, each included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Except for the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02” or “Topic 842”), through June 28, 2019, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) 1. Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the instructions to Form 10-Q and the provisions of Regulation S-X pertaining to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. have been condensed or omitted. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the opinion of management, these interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments and accruals of a normal and recurring nature necessary to fairly state the results of the interim periods presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or for any future periods. The Company’s unaudited interim financial statements are prepared for each quarterly period ending on the Friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the exception of the fourth quarter which always ends on December 31. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 6 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). ASU 2018-15 should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 on a prospective basis during the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 shall be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effects of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Reform Act is recognized. January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 during the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 during the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in the recording of additional net operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $35.3 million and $36.5 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 did not have an impact on the Company’s Accumulated deficit, consolidated statement of operations, or consolidated statement of cash flows. 7 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) 2. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month, and aggregate to less than 3% of the Company’s consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of 8 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) when the Company expects to recognize revenue. As of March 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , contract liabilities were $ 3.7 million and $ 4.7 million, res pectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the three months ended March 29, 2019 is primarily due to $ 1.9 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2018, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 16 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 3. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was as follows (in thousands): Total Accumulated Other Cumulative Pension Comprehensive Translation Liability Income (Loss) Adjustments Adjustments Balance at December 31, 2018 $ (22,527 ) $ (12,485 ) $ (10,042 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) 2,105 2,339 (234 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (1) 251 — 251 Balance at March 29, 2019 $ (20,171 ) $ (10,146 ) $ (10,025 ) (1) The amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) were included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. 4. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Novanta Inc., after redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company recognized changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value by adjusting the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest as of the end of the applicable period to the higher of: (i) the estimated redemption value assuming the end of the period was also the redemption date or (ii) the carrying value without any redemption value adjustments. Such adjustments were recorded in retained earnings in stockholders’ equity instead of net income attributable to Novanta Inc. For both basic and diluted earnings per common share, such redemption value adjustments were included in the calculation of the numerator. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator also includes the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, 2017 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units and total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units determined using the treasury stock method. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum noncontrolling interest shareholders, as well as 2018 and 2019 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units will be included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period. 9 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share ( amounts in thousands, except per share data ): Three Months Ended March 29, March 30, 2019 (1) 2018 (2) Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 12,253 $ 12,837 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — (926 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. 12,253 11,911 Redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment — (5,399 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. after adjustment for redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value $ 12,253 $ 6,512 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 34,958 34,887 Dilutive potential common shares 516 541 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,474 35,428 Antidilutive common shares excluded from above 58 12 Earnings per Common Share Attributable to Novanta Inc.: Basic $ 0.35 $ 0.19 Diluted $ 0.35 $ 0.18 (1) 45,252 non-GAAP EPS performance restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213,219 shares of restricted stock issued to Laser Quantum former non-controlling interest holders are considered contingently issuable shares and are excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of March 29, 2019. (2) 53,968 non-GAAP EPS performance restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of March 30, 2018. 5. Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: • Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access • Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 • Level 3: Unobservable inputs Cash Equivalents The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The 10 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities . Contingent Consideration On December 14, 2016, the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets from 2018 to 2021 by the Company from products using such technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to €5.5 million ($6.6 million). If such targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the asset acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset. There were no changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration during the three months ended March 29, 2019. Summary by Fair Value Hierarchy The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 29, 2019 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Significant Other Active Markets for Significant Other Unobservable Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 3,252 $ 3,252 $ — $ — Prepaid expenses and other current assets: Foreign currency forward contracts 296 — 296 — $ 3,548 $ 3,252 $ 296 $ — Liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: Contingent consideration - Current $ 1,248 $ — $ — $ 1,248 Foreign currency forward contracts 6 — 6 — Other liabilities: Contingent consideration - Long-term 2,128 — — 2,128 $ 3,382 $ — $ 6 $ 3,376 11 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Significant Other Active Markets for Significant Other Unobservable Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 4,288 $ 4,288 $ — $ — Prepaid expenses and other current assets: Foreign currency forward contracts 15 — 15 — $ 4,303 $ 4,288 $ 15 $ — Liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: Foreign currency forward contracts $ 182 $ — $ 182 $ — Other liabilities: Contingent consideration - Long-term 3,376 — — 3,376 $ 3,558 $ — $ 182 $ 3,376 As of March 29, 2019, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s contingent consideration were projected revenues and a discount rate. Increases or decreases in the unobservable inputs would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. See Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt. 6. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposures to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. The Company uses forward contracts as a part of its strategy to limit its exposures related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These forward contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. All changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in income before income taxes. As of March 29, 2019, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $25.5 million and a net gain of $0.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $31.2 million and a net loss of $0.2 million, respectively. The Company recognized an aggregate net loss of $0.5 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019, and an aggregate net gain of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018. These amounts were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented. 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the consideration for a business combination exceeds the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired.

The Third Amendment increased the revolving credit facility under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $100 million, from $225 million to $325 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $125 million for potential future expansion. Additionally, the Third Amendment increased the term loan balance from $65.6 million to $90.6 million. Under the Third Amendment, the Company is required to pay quarterly scheduled principal repayments of $2.3 million beginning in October 2017, with the final installment of $56.1 million due upon maturity in May 2021. In February 2018, the Company entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio from 3.00 to 3.50, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for permitted acquisitions and stock repurchases from 2.50 to 3.00, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for a designated acquisition from 3.00 to 3.50, and increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition from 3.50 to 4.00. The Fourth Amendment also made certain other technical changes to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company is required to satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of March 29, 2019. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc., Novanta Corporation, NDS Surgical Imaging LLC, Novanta Europe GmbH, Novanta UK Investments Holding 15 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) Limited and Novanta Technologies UK Limited. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Fair Value of Debt As of March 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 10. Leases The Company leases certain equipment and facilities. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of these leases include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance or other property management costs). The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components separately. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. Most leases held by the Company expire between 2019 and 2031. In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078. Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years, and some include options to terminate the leases within one year. The exercise of lease renewal or termination option is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements is limited to the expected lease terms. Most leases held by the Company do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate for the same jurisdiction and term as the associated lease based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. The Company has a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, the Company applies a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment. The following table summarizes the components of lease costs (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 29, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 1,823 Finance lease cost Amortization of right-of-use assets 178 Interest on lease liabilities 105 Variable lease cost 138 Total lease cost $ 2,244 16 NOVANTA INC.

Share-Based Compensation The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 29, March 30, 2019 2018 Selling, general and administrative $ 2,531 $ 1,924 Research and development and engineering 111 84 Cost of revenue 85 36 Total share-based compensation expense $ 2,727 $ 2,044 18 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) Share-based compensation reported in selling, general and administrative expenses during each of the three -month periods ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018 , respectively, included $0.8 million and $0. 5 million of expense related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and historical forfeiture experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. The compensation expense associated with DSUs is recognized in full on the date of grant, as DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. The table below summarizes activities relating to RSUs and DSUs issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended March 29, 2019: Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2018 529 $ 26.98 Granted 101 $ 75.29 Vested (141 ) $ 28.33 Forfeited (8 ) $ 34.70 Unvested at March 29, 2019 481 $ 36.61 Expected to vest as of March 29, 2019 454 The total fair value of RSUs and DSUs that vested during the three months ended March 29, 2019 was $10.7 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. Performance Stock Units The Company granted two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over the three-year performance period against the target established by the Company’s Compensation Committee at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200% of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200% of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. 19 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) The table below summarizes the activities relating to the performance -based awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during the three months ended March 29, 2019 : Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested at December 31, 2018 137 $ 37.28 Granted 44 $ 92.93 Performance adjustment (1) 29 $ 14.13 Vested (59 ) $ 14.13 Forfeited — $ — Unvested at March 29, 2019 151 $ 57.57 (1) Represents adjustment for performance-based awards granted on March 30, 2016. These units vested at 200% during the three months ended March 29, 2019 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS during the performance period of fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The total fair value of PSUs that vested during the three months ended March 29, 2019 was $5.0 million based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte-Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Three Months Ended March 29, 2019 Grant-date stock price $ 77.23 Expected volatility 32.54 % Risk-free interest rate 2.46 % Expected annual dividend yield — Fair value $ 108.58 12. Income Taxes The Company determines its estimated annual effective tax rate at the end of each interim period based on full-year forecasted pre-tax income and facts known at that time. The estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax income at the end of each interim period with the cumulative effect of any changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate being recorded in the fiscal quarter in which the change is determined. The tax effect of significant unusual items is reflected in the period in which they occur. Since the Company is incorporated in Canada, it is required to use Canada’s statutory tax rate of 29.0% in the determination of the estimated annual effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate of 0.6% for the three months ended March 29, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. The Company’s effective tax rate of 11.0% for the three months ended March 30, 2018 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on some of its deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is required when, based upon an assessment of various factors, including recent operating loss history, anticipated future earnings, and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 20 NOVANTA INC.

Acquisition related costs recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions totaled $0.5 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019. The majority of acquisition related costs for the three months ended March 29, 2019 were included in the Company’s Precision Motion reportable segment. 14. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments There have been no material changes to the Company’s purchase commitments since December 31, 2018. Legal Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigations and may revise its estimates. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by- 22 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued) AS OF MARCH 29, 2019 (Unaudited) laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which he or she is involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a pr oceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification ag reements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlem ent actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such d irector or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedur es for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnificati on, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 15. Related Party Transactions Certain members of the Company’s board of directors currently serve on the board of directors or as an advisor of companies that are customers of the Company. All contracts with related parties are executed at arm’s length in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate revenue from these customers was $11.6 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019. There was $5.1 million and $0.6 million in accounts receivable due from these customers as of March 29, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. There were no material transactions with related parties in the three months ended March 30, 2018. 16. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of, and allocates resources to, its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers. Based upon the information provided to the CODM, the Company has determined it operates in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics The Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, continuous wave and ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Vision The Vision segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless imaging and operating room integration technologies; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies; and embedded touch screen solutions.

Business Overview We are a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. Reportable Segments We operate in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics Our Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, continuous wave and ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide. The segment serves highly demanding photonics-based applications for advanced industrial processes, metrology, medical and life science imaging, DNA sequencing, and medical laser procedures. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Vision Our Vision segment designs, manufactures and markets a range of medical grade technologies, including medical insufflators, pumps and related disposables; visualization solutions; wireless imaging and operating room integration technologies; optical data collection and machine vision technologies; radio frequency identification (“RFID”) technologies; thermal chart recorders; spectrometry technologies, and embedded touch screen solutions. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. Precision Motion Our Precision Motion segment designs, manufactures and markets optical and inductive encoders, precision motors, motion control sub-assemblies, air bearings, air bearing spindles and precision machined components to customers worldwide. The vast majority of the segment’s product offerings are sold to OEM customers. The segment sells these products both directly, utilizing a highly technical sales force, and indirectly, through resellers and distributors. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the advanced industrial market and the medical market. Advanced Industrial Market For the three months ended March 29, 2019, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the three months ended March 29, 2019, the medical market accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, changes 27 in regulatory requirements an d laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, trends in surgical procedures, changes in technology requirements, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends . Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, expanded sales and marketing channels to reach target customers, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles and strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. 28 Results of Operations for the Three M onths Ended March 29, 2019 Compared with the Three M onths Ended March 30, 2018 The following table sets forth our unaudited results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended March 29, March 30, 2019 2018 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 57.8 57.7 Gross profit 42.2 42.3 Operating expenses: Research and development and engineering 8.9 8.2 Selling, general and administrative 20.3 19.9 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 2.5 2.5 Restructuring and acquisition related costs 1.3 0.0 Total operating expenses 33.0 30.6 Operating income 9.2 11.7 Interest income (expense), net (1.3 ) (1.6 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net 0.0 (0.3 ) Other income (expense), net (0.0 ) (0.0 ) Income before income taxes 7.8 9.8 Income tax provision 0.0 1.1 Consolidated net income 7.8 8.7 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — (0.6 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. 7.8 % 8.1 % Overview of Financial Results Total revenue for the three months ended March 29, 2019 increased $10.2 million, or 7.0%, versus the prior year period. The effect of our prior year acquisition resulted in an increase in revenue of $3.8 million, or 2.6%. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by $3.9 million, or 2.6%, for the three months ended March 29, 2019. Operating income decreased $2.8 million from $17.2 million for the three months ended March 30, 2018 to $14.4 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses of $7.0 million, including a $2.0 million increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs, partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $4.1 million. Diluted earnings per share (“Diluted EPS”) of $0.35 for the three months ended March 29, 2019 increased $0.17 from the prior year period. This increase was primarily attributable to the negative effect of a $5.4 million Laser Quantum nontaxable redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment in the prior year period that is not applicable in the current year, and a lower income tax provision in the three months ended March 29, 2019 as a result of higher windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards, partially offset by higher restructuring and acquisition related costs. (See Note 4 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the effect of the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment on EPS in the prior year period.) Revenue The following table sets forth external revenue by reportable segment for the periods noted (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended March 29, March 30, Increase Percentage 2019 2018 (Decrease) Change Photonics $ 59,225 $ 61,831 $ (2,606 ) (4.2 )% Vision 65,936 56,209 9,727 17.3 % Precision Motion 32,025 28,925 3,100 10.7 % Total $ 157,186 $ 146,965 $ 10,221 7.0 % 29 Photonics Photonics segment revenue for the three months ended March 29, 2019 decreased by $2.6 million, or 4.2%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in revenue of our optical light engine products. Vision Vision segment revenue for the three months ended March 29, 2019 increased by $9.7 million, or 17.3%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenue of our minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”) products of $9.1 million as a result of increased demand in the medical market. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment revenue for the three months ended March 29, 2019 increased by $3.1 million, or 10.7%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenue of our inductive encoders products as a result of the Zettlex acquisition in May 2018. Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin The following table sets forth the gross profit and gross profit margin for each of our reportable segments for the periods noted (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended March 29, March 30, 2019 2018 Gross profit: Photonics $ 27,314 $ 29,555 Vision 25,973 19,721 Precision Motion 13,521 13,260 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (519 ) (377 ) Total $ 66,289 $ 62,159 Gross profit margin: Photonics 46.1 % 47.8 % Vision 39.4 % 35.1 % Precision Motion 42.2 % 45.8 % Total 42.2 % 42.3 % Gross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, headcount, inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses. Photonics Photonics segment gross profit for the three months ended March 29, 2019 decreased $2.2 million, or 7.6%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in revenue. Photonics segment gross profit margin was 46.1% for the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus a gross profit margin of 47.8% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to unfavorable product mix. Vision Vision segment gross profit for the three months ended March 29, 2019 increased $6.3 million, or 31.7%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenue. Vision segment gross profit margin was 39.4% for the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus a gross profit margin of 35.1% for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to changes in product mix. 30 Precision Motion Precision Motion segment gross profit for the three months ended March 29, 2019 increased $0.3 million, or 2.0%, versus the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in revenue. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 42.2% for the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus a gross profit margin of 45.8% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to cost of poor quality impacts and unfavorable product mix. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expenses for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 29, March 30, 2019 2018 Research and development and engineering $ 13,997 $ 11,989 Selling, general and administrative 31,847 29,220 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 3,998 3,698 Restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs 2,054 25 Total $ 51,896 $ 44,932 Research and Development and Engineering Expenses Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. R&D expenses were $14.0 million, or 8.9% of revenue, during the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus $12.0 million, or 8.2% of revenue, during the prior year period. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to higher investments across the majority of our product lines. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems, and executive management functions. SG&A expenses were $31.8 million, or 20.3% of revenue, during the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus $29.2 million, or 19.9% of revenue, during the prior year period. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses as a result of higher headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies included in cost of revenue, was $4.0 million, or 2.5% of revenue, during the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus $3.7 million, or 2.5% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase, in terms of total dollars, was the result of acquired intangible assets from our prior year acquisition. Restructuring and Acquisition Related Costs We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $2.0 million during the three months ended March 29, 2019. Restructuring and acquisition related costs in the three months ended March 29, 2019 included restructuring charges of $1.2 million related to the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs and acquisition related costs of $0.8 million primarily related to earn-out costs associated with the Zettlex acquisition in May 2018. 31 Operating Income ( Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 30, March 30, 2019 2018 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 12,310 $ 15,323 Vision 4,557 475 Precision Motion 5,635 8,607 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (8,109 ) (7,178 ) Total $ 14,393 $ 17,227 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $12.3 million, or 20.8% of revenue, during the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus $15.3 million, or 24.8% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $2.2 million and an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses of $0.9 million. Vision Vision segment operating income was $4.6 million, or 6.9% of revenue, during the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus $0.5 million, or 0.8% of revenue, during the prior year period. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $6.3 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.2 million and an increase in restructuring related charges of $0.6 million associated with the 2018 restructuring program. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $5.6 million, or 17.6% of revenue, during the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus $8.6 million, or 29.8% of revenue, during the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses of $2.2 million and an increase in acquisition earn-out costs of $0.5 million associated with the Zettlex acquisition. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared services functions that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs. These costs for the three months ended March 29, 2019 increased by $0.9 million versus the prior year period primarily due to an increase in restructuring related charges of $0.4 million as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs, and an increase in SG&A expenses of $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses as a result of higher stock-based compensation expense. Other Income and Expense Items The following table sets forth other income and expense items for the periods noted (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 29, March 30, 2019 2018 Interest income (expense), net $ (2,044 ) $ (2,358 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net 41 (407 ) Other income (expense), net (68 ) (41 ) Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $2.0 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus $2.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels, partially offset by an increase in the 32 weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities . The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 3.78 % during the three months ended March 29, 2019 , versus 3. 47 % during the three months ended March 30, 2018 . Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were less than $0.1 million net gains for the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus $0.4 million net losses in the prior year period, primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Euro, partially offset by realized losses from foreign currency contracts. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal for both the three months ended March 29, 2019 and the three months ended March 30, 2018. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 29, 2019 was 0.6%, versus 11.0% for the prior year. Our effective tax rate of 0.6% for the three months ended March 29, 2019 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. Our effective tax rate of 11.0% for the three months ended March 30, 2018 differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, U.K. patent box deductions and other tax credits, and windfall tax benefits upon vesting of certain stock-based compensation awards during the period. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest expense. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of March 29, 2019, $46.7 million of our $74.1 million cash and cash equivalents was held by subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Approximately 65.5% of our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities was held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. In certain instances, we have identified excess cash which we may repatriate and have established deferred tax liabilities for the expected tax cost. Because of our ownership structure, our foreign entities outside the U.S. are not considered controlled foreign corporations of the U.S. company, as defined under U.S. tax principles, and accordingly, the accumulated earnings of these foreign subsidiaries are not subject to the one-time toll charge under the U.S.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”). 33 Share Repurchase Plan In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of our common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We had $25.0 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of March 29, 2019. Under the 2018 Repurchase Plan, shares may be repurchased from time to time, at our discretion, based on our ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be purchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The 2018 Repurchase Plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund the share repurchases through cash on hand and future cash generated from operations. Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement In May 2016, we entered into the second amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), consisting of a $75.0 million, 5-year term loan facility and a $225.0 million, 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in May 2021. In August 2017, we entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment increased the borrowing limit under the revolving credit facility commitment from $225 million to $325 million and reset the accordion feature to $125 million for future expansion. Additionally, the Third Amendment increased the term loan balance from $65.6 million to $90.6 million. In February 2018, we entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio from 3.00 to 3.50, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for permitted acquisitions and stock repurchases from 2.50 to 3.00, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for a designated acquisition from 3.00 to 3.50, and increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition from 3.50 to 4.00. The Fourth Amendment also made certain other technical changes to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of March 29, 2019, we had term loans of $69.9 million and revolving loans of $132.5 million outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of March 29, 2019: Requirement Actual Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.62 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 5.12 Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 29, 2019 and March 30, 2018 The following table summarizes our cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, and unused and available funds under our revolving credit facility for the periods indicated (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 29, March 30, 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,457 $ 20,409 Net cash used in investing activities $ (2,405 ) $ (2,881 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (10,630 ) $ (8,320 ) 34 March 29, December 31, 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 74,074 $ 82,043 Unused and available funds under revolving credit facility $ 192,520 $ 189,942 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $5.5 million for the three months ended March 29, 2019, versus $20.4 million for the prior year period. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 29, 2019 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities in the three months ended March 29, 2019 which decreased cash provided by operating activities by $19.1 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 29, 2019 was negatively impacted by the timing of sales and inventory purchases in the three months ended March 29, 2019, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018. During the three months ended March 29, 2019, we paid the first milestone payment under the Zettlex earn-out agreement amounting to $3.9 million and paid the 2018 annual employee bonuses, both of which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 30, 2018 was positively impacted by a decrease in our days sales outstanding which decreased from 51 days at December 31, 2017 to 47 days at March 30, 2018 and by an increase in our days payables outstanding which increased from 43 days at December 31, 2017 to 44 days at March 30, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in inventories, as our inventory turnover ratio decreased from 3.7 at December 31, 2017 to 3.5 at March 30, 2018, a decrease in accrued expenses and an increase in income tax payments. During the three months ended March 30, 2018, we paid $2.8 million as the final Applimotion contingent consideration payment which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2017.
