As of the final settlement date, Bank of America may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the Company or the Company may be required to deliver shares of common stock to Bank America, such that the Company’s repurchase of common stock under the ASR Agreement in aggregate will equal the ASR Repurchase Amount (based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a specified discount). The ASR Agreement contains provisions customary for agreements of this type, including the mechanisms to determine the number of shares of common stock that will be delivered at settlement, the required timing of delivery of the shares of common stock, the circumstances under which Bank of America is permitted to make adjustments to the transaction terms, the circumstances under which the ASR Agreement may be accelerated, extended or terminated early by Bank of America and specified representations and warranties of each party to the other party.

On November 1, 2023, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Gentherm Incorporated (the “Company”) extended the maturity date of the Company’s 2020 stock repurchase program (as amended, the “2020 Stock Repurchase Program”) from December 15, 2023 to June 30, 2024. Under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of its issued and outstanding common stock (the “common stock”), with approximately $97 million remaining available as of such Board approval. The authorization and extension of the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program does not require that the Company repurchase any specific dollar value or number of shares and may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board at any time. On November 1, 2023 and following the above-noted extension, the Company entered into a Confirmation of Issuer Forward Repurchase Transaction agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. (the “Bank of America”) that provides for the Company to purchase shares of common stock in an aggregate amount of $60 million (the “ASR Repurchase Amount”) under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program. The ASR Agreement is part of the Company’s announced capital allocation strategy and furthers its opportunistic share buyback program. Under the terms of the ASR Agreement, on November 2, 2023, the Company will pay $60 million (the “Prepayment Amount”) to Bank of America for an initial purchase of approximately 1.22 million shares of common stock, representing 80% of ASR Repurchase Amount. The final settlement date is scheduled to occur no later than the second quarter of 2024 and may end earlier at the option of Bank of America. As of the final settlement date, Bank of America may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the Company or the Company may be required to deliver shares of common stock to Bank America, such that the Company’s repurchase of common stock under the ASR Agreement in aggregate will equal the ASR Repurchase Amount (based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a specified discount). The ASR Agreement contains provisions customary for agreements of this type, including the mechanisms to determine the number of shares of common stock that will be delivered at settlement, the required timing of delivery of the shares of common stock, the circumstances under which Bank of America is permitted to make adjustments to the transaction terms, the circumstances under which the ASR Agreement may be accelerated, extended or terminated early by Bank of America and specified representations and warranties of each party to the other party. The foregoing description of the ASR Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the ASR Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company reported net income of $32.5 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2019, compared to net income of $24.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2018. THIRD QUARTER 2019 COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS: Joe Hanna, President and CEO of McGrath RentCorp, made the following comments regarding these results and future expectations: “The third quarter underscored the benefit of our diverse portfolio as companywide total revenues increased 21%. Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, and Enviroplex delivered significant operating profit growth compared to a year ago, contributing to the Company’s overall 30% operating profit increase. Our operating profit growth was driven by strong gross profit increases in both rental operations and sales. Mobile Modular rental revenues for the quarter increased 13% from a year ago, driven by improvement in average rental rates, a larger fleet and improved utilization with equipment on rent increasing 7%. Commercial and education rentals grew compared to a year ago, and reflected healthy overall business conditions. Portable Storage rental revenues grew by 11%. TRS-RenTelco rental revenues for the quarter increased 21%, primarily driven by higher average rental equipment and improved utilization. Demand for both general purpose and communications test equipment was healthy, as we serviced testing demand for both R&D needs as well as communications network upgrades. Adler Tank Rentals rental revenues for the quarter decreased 8% from a year ago, driven primarily by lower utilization, partly offset by higher rental rates. Weaker activity levels across multiple market segments contributed to a slower quarter compared to a year ago. Sales revenues increased 41%, driven by seasonally strong demand for education projects at Enviroplex. Our portfolio enabled us to deliver strong top line and operating profit growth despite softness in one of our businesses. We remain positive about our overall momentum entering the fourth quarter. Despite some economic uncertainty, many fundamentals remain healthy and our activity levels are good. We look forward to finishing 2019 on solid footing.” ____________ DIVISION HIGHLIGHTS: All comparisons presented below are for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 to the quarter ended September 30, 2018 unless otherwise indicated. MOBILE MODULAR For the third quarter of 2019, the Company’s Mobile Modular division reported income from operations of $22.2 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 16%. Rental revenues increased 13% to $46.7 million, depreciation expense increased 5% to $5.6 million and other direct costs increased 20% to $12.8 million, which resulted in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of 12% to $28.4 million. Rental related services revenues increased 39% to $22.6 million, with associated gross profit increasing 55% to $5.8 million. Sales revenues decreased 3% to $16.7 million while gross margin on sales increased to 28% from 24%, resulting in a 13% increase in gross profit on sales revenues to $4.7 million. Selling and administrative expenses increased 19% to $17.0 million, primarily due to higher allocated corporate expenses and increased salaries and employee benefit costs. TRS-RENTELCO For the third quarter of 2019, the Company’s TRS-RenTelco division reported income from operations of $10.1 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 32%. Rental revenues increased 21% to $26.9 million, depreciation expense increased 19% to $10.8 million and other direct costs increased 9% to $4.1 million, which resulted in a 28% increase in gross profit on rental revenues to $12.0 million.

ADLER TANKS For the third quarter of 2019, the Company’s Adler Tanks division reported income from operations of $5.1 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 7%. Rental revenues decreased 8% to $17.2 million, depreciation expense increased 3% to $4.1 million and other direct costs decreased 15% to $2.8 million, which resulted in a decrease in gross profit on rental revenues of 10% to $10.3 million. Rental related services revenues increased 7% to $7.4 million, with gross profit on rental related services increasing 28% to $1.9 million. Selling and administrative expenses decreased 6% to $7.2 million, primarily due to decreased salaries and employee benefit costs. FINANCIAL OUTLOOK: Based upon the Company’s year-to-date results and current outlook for the remainder of the year, the Company is raising its financial outlook and expects its 2019 total operating profit to increase 15% to 19% above 2018 results, as compared to our prior expectation of a 9% to 14% increase.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, regarding McGrath RentCorp’s expectations, strategies, prospects or targets are forward looking statements.

MCGRATH RENTCORP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED) MCGRATH RENTCORP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED) MCGRATH RENTCORP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures To supplement the Company’s financial data presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is defined by the Company as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate the Company’s period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, regarding McGrath RentCorp’s expectations, strategies, prospects or targets are forward looking statements. These forward-looking statements also can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “will,” or “anticipates” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. In particular, Mr. Hanna’s comments on remaining positive about the Company’s overall momentum entering the fourth quarter, economic fundamentals remaining healthy with good activity levels, finishing 2019 on solid footing, as well as the updated full year 2019 outlook in the “Financial Outlook” section are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected including: the extent of the recovery underway in our modular building division; the state of the wireless communications network upgrade environment; the utilization levels and rental rates of our Adler Tanks liquid and sold containment tank and box rental assets; continued execution of our performance improvement initiatives; and our ability to effectively manage our rental assets, as well as the factors disclosed under “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

MCGRATH RENTCORP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED) MCGRATH RENTCORP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED) MCGRATH RENTCORP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures To supplement the Company’s financial data presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is defined by the Company as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate the Company’s period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

The Company reported net income of $19.5 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2019, compared to net income of $15.9 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2018. SECOND QUARTER 2019 COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS: Joe Hanna, President and CEO of McGrath RentCorp, made the following comments regarding these results and future expectations: “For the second quarter, each of our divisions continued to perform well as companywide rental revenues increased 14% and operating profit increased 19%. Our $4.6 million operating profit growth was driven by a $6.2 million rental gross profit increase, that fully offset a $2.6 million sales gross profit decrease. We are pleased with the positive momentum in our business as we take advantage of favorable economic conditions and continue to implement our strategy of performance improvement. Mobile Modular rental revenues for the quarter increased 17% from a year ago, driven by improvement in average rental rates, a larger fleet and improved utilization. Activity in each of our operating geographies was healthy in both commercial and education markets. Portable Storage rental revenues grew by 16%. Sales revenues decreased year over year, due primarily to project timing. TRS-RenTelco rental revenues for the quarter increased 15%, primarily driven by higher average rental equipment and improved utilization. Demand for both communications and general purpose test equipment has been healthy, including some increased initial activity related to 5G. Adler Tank Rentals rental revenues for the quarter increased 6% from a year ago driven primarily by higher rental rates, partly offset by lower utilization. Five of six industry vertical markets increased year-over-year on broad-based demand. The first half of the year is complete and we are pleased with the execution of our strategy. At this time, our order backlogs and activity levels remain healthy. We enter the second half of 2019 on a positive note and upwardly revised financial outlook. Our focus on performance improvement and prudent capital allocation continues.” DIVISION HIGHLIGHTS: All comparisons presented below are for the quarter ended June 30, 2019 to the quarter ended June 30, 2018 unless otherwise indicated.

MCGRATH RENTCORP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED) MCGRATH RENTCORP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED) MCGRATH RENTCORP CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures To supplement the Company’s financial data presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is defined by the Company as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate the Company’s period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
