Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated October 24, 2023, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated October 24, 2023, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP Measures Verizon’s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset rationalization, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Severance charges recorded during 2021 relate to voluntary separations under our existing plans. Asset rationalization relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we have made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives in 2023. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon’s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, business transformation costs, non-strategic business shutdown and severance, pension and benefits charges. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Forecast Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow forecast is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures forecast (including capitalized software) from forecasted net cash provided by operating activities. Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of operating performance. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company’s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. See the accompanying schedules for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits (d) Exhibits.

Total broadband net additions included 384,000 fixed wireless net additions, an increase of 42,000 fixed wireless net additions from third-quarter 2022. Verizon now has approximately 10.3 million total broadband subscribers, including nearly 2.7 million subscribers on its fixed wireless service. • 72,000 Fios Internet net additions, an increase from 61,000 Fios Internet net additions in third-quarter 2022.

NEW YORK - Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) reported third-quarter results today and raised its free cash flow guidance for the year. The company's performance was highlighted by continued wireless service revenue growth, total broadband net additions, and improving profitability. ""We continued to make steady progress in the third quarter with a clear focus on growing wireless service revenue, delivering healthy consolidated adjusted EBITDA and increasing free cash flow,"" said Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. ""Our financial discipline, combined with our healthy balance sheet, enabled us to increase our dividend for the 17th consecutive year, which is the longest current streak of dividend increases in the U.S. telecom industry."" For third-quarter 2023, Verizon reported EPS of $1.13, compared with $1.17 in third-quarter 2022. On an adjusted basis 1 , excluding special items, EPS was $1.22 in third-quarter 2023, compared with adjusted EPS 1 of $1.32 in third-quarter 2022. Third-quarter 2023 earnings reflected a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $579 million. This included the impacts of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions of $224 million, a pre-tax non-strategic business shutdown charge of $179 million related to the shutdown of the BlueJeans business offering and pre-tax business transformation costs of $176 million. Consolidated results • Total consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2023 of $33.3 billion, a decrease of 2.6 percent from third-quarter 2022. This decline was primarily due to reduced wireless equipment revenue and lower postpaid upgrade activity. • Total wireless service revenue 2 in third-quarter 2023 increased 2.9 percent year over year and 1.1 percent from second-quarter 2023. This increase was driven by targeted pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, the larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, and growth from fixed wireless offerings. • Net income of $4.9 billion, a decrease of 2.8 percent compared to third-quarter 2022, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA 1 of $12.2 billion, an increase of 0.2 percent year over year. • Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled $28.8 billion, an increase from $28.2 billion in 2022. This increase is related to continued working capital improvements associated with fewer upgrades and lower inventory levels, partially offset by higher interest payments. • Capital expenditures year-to-date were $14.2 billion. Page 2 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= • Free cash flow 1 year-to-date was $14.6 billion, an increase from $12.4 billion in 2022. • Verizon's unsecured debt as of the end of third-quarter 2023 decreased by $4.9 billion sequentially to $126.4 billion. The company's net unsecured debt 1 balance improved sequentially by $4.3 billion to $122.2 billion. At the end of third-quarter 2023, Verizon's ratio of unsecured debt to net income (LTM) was approximately 5.9 times, and its net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 1 was approximately 2.6 times. Verizon Consumer results • Total Verizon Consumer revenue was $25.3 billion, a decrease of 2.3 percent year over year. Growth in service and other revenue was offset by wireless equipment revenue declines. • Wireless service revenue increased 2.9 percent year over year. This increase was driven by growth in retail postpaid Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA), partially offset by a decline in retail postpaid phone connections and prepaid connections. • Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.04 percent in third-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.85 percent. • In third-quarter 2023, Consumer reported 51,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net losses, representing an improvement of 85,000 from second-quarter 2023 and 138,000 from third-quarter 2022. Consumer postpaid phone gross additions increased 2.3 percent year over year in third-quarter 2023, continuing the momentum that began in second-half 2022. • Consumer reported 207,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in third-quarter 2023. • Consumer reported 251,000 fixed wireless net additions and 69,000 Fios Internet net additions in third-quarter 2023. Consumer Fios revenue was $2.9 billion in third-quarter 2023, a decrease of 0.2 percent year over year. • In third-quarter 2023, Consumer operating income was $7.5 billion, an increase of 2.7 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 29.9 percent, an increase from 28.4 percent in third-quarter 2022. Segment EBITDA 1 in third-quarter 2023 was $10.8 billion, an increase of 2.2 percent year over year. This improvement can be attributed to wireless service revenue growth and lower upgrade volumes. Segment EBITDA margin 1 was 42.8 percent, an increase from 40.9 percent in third-quarter 2022. Verizon Business results • Total Verizon Business revenue was $7.5 billion in third-quarter 2023, a decrease of 4.0 percent year over year. Lower wireline revenue and lower wireless equipment revenue was partially offset by higher wireless service revenue. • Business wireless service revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 2.9 percent year over year. This growth was driven by continued strong net additions and pricing actions implemented in recent quarters. • Business reported 330,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in third-quarter 2023, including 151,000 postpaid phone net additions. This was the ninth consecutive quarter that Business reported more than 125,000 postpaid phone net additions. Business continues to grow volumes and expand its relationships with customers strengthening its position as a wireless market share leader. Page 3 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= • Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.47 percent in third-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.14 percent. • Business reported 133,000 fixed wireless net additions in third-quarter 2023. • In third-quarter 2023, Verizon Business operating income was $539 million, a decrease of 22.8 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 7.2 percent, a decrease from 8.9 percent in third-quarter 2022. Segment EBITDA 1 was $1.7 billion in third-quarter 2023, a decrease of 6.2 percent year over year, driven by continued declines in high margin wireline revenues. Segment EBITDA margin 1 was 22.1 percent in third-quarter 2023, a decrease from 22.7 percent in third-quarter 2022. Outlook and guidance The company does not provide a reconciliation for certain of the following adjusted (non-GAAP) forecasts because it cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise, and the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. For 2023, Verizon expects the following: • Cash flow from operations in the range of $36.25 billion to $37.25 billion. • Capital spending at the higher end of the previously guided range of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. • Free cash flow 1 above $18 billion, a $1 billion increase from the previously issued guidance. In addition, for 2023, Verizon continues to expect the following: • Total wireless service revenue growth 2 3 of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. • Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. • Adjusted EPS 1 of $4.55 to $4.85. • Adjusted effective income tax rate 1 in the range of 22.5 percent to 24.0 percent. 1 Non-GAAP financial measure. See the accompanying schedules and www.verizon.com/about/investors for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 2 Total wireless service revenue represents the sum of Consumer and Business segments. 3 Includes a benefit of approximately 190 basis points from the reallocation from other revenue to wireless service revenue. This results from a larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery charges which partly recover network operating costs. Verizon Communications Inc.

Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings. During the first quarter of 2023, Verizon reorganized the customer groups within its Business segment. Previously, this segment was comprised of four customer groups: Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale. Following the reorganization, there are now three customer groups: Enterprise and Public Sector, Business Markets and Other, and Wholesale. Enterprise and Public Sector combines the customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other (excluding BlueJeans and Connect customers) as well as the commercial wireline customers previously included in Small and Medium Business. Business Markets and Other combines the customers previously included in Small and Medium Business (excluding commercial wireline customers), the BlueJeans customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other, and the Connect customers previously included in Public Sector and Other. The Wholesale customer group remained unchanged. Prior period operating revenue results within the Business segment have been recast for these reorganized customer groups. There was no change to the composition of our reportable segments and total segment results, nor the determination of segment profit. The segment financial results and metrics above exclude the effects of special items (other than the effects of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization), which the Company’s chief operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance.

(Verizon) for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023 contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is included at the end of this document and is also contained in Verizon's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated Financial Results * Non-GAAP financial measure. ** Total Wireless service revenue represents the sum of Consumer and Business segments. Consolidated total operating revenue for the third quarter was $33.3 billion, down 2.6% year over year. • Service and other revenue was $27.5 billion, down 0.5% year over year, as the growth of Wireless service revenue was offset by wireline declines and lower Other revenue due to the reallocation of certain fees. ◦ Total Wireless service revenue 2 was $19.3 billion, up 2.9% year over year, driven primarily by pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from Other revenue into Wireless service revenue, and growth from our fixed wireless access (FWA) offerings. ◦ Total Fios revenue was $3.2 billion, relatively flat year over year. Page 2 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= VZQTR20FIN • Wireless equipment revenue was $5.8 billion, down 11.6% year over year, predominantly due to lower upgrade rates. Consolidated net income for the third quarter was $4.9 billion, down 2.8% year over year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA 1 for the third quarter was $12.2 billion, up 0.2% year over year, driven by Wireless service revenue growth and lower upgrade rates. Consolidated operating expenses for the third quarter were $25.9 billion, down 1.8% year over year. Consolidated operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items, 1 were $21.1 billion, down 4.2% year over year. Interest expense for the third quarter was $1.4 billion compared to $1.3 billion for the second quarter 2023 due to lower capitalized interest and higher interest rates on our outstanding debt balance. Earnings per share (EPS) was $1.13, down 3.4% year over year. • Third quarter 2023 earnings reflected a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $579 million. This includes the impacts of amortization of intangible assets related to Tracfone and other acquisitions of $224 million, a pre-tax non-strategic business shutdown charge of $179 million related to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering, and pre-tax business transformation costs of $176 million primarily related to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Business customers. Adjusted EPS 1 was $1.22, down 7.6% year over year. Page 3 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= VZQTR20FIN Cash Flow Summary * Non-GAAP financial measure. Cash flow from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $28.8 billion compared to $28.2 billion in the prior year period driven by working capital improvements as a result of lower receivables and lower inventory levels tied to fewer upgrades, which were offset by higher interest payments. • Capital spending for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $14.2 billion. • We now expect 2023 capital spending to be at the higher end of the previously guided range of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. Free cash flow 1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $14.6 billion. Total unsecured debt as of the end of the third quarter was $126.4 billion, a $4.9 billion improvement compared to the prior quarter and $5.0 billion lower year over year. Unsecured debt to net income (LTM) ratio was 5.9x as of the end of the third quarter, a decrease of 0.2x compared to the prior quarter and a 0.7x improvement year over year. Net unsecured debt 1 as of the end of the third quarter was $122.2 billion, a $4.3 billion improvement compared to the prior quarter and $7.1 billion lower year over year. Net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 1 was 2.6x as of the end of the third quarter, flat compared to the prior quarter and a 0.1x improvement year over year. Page 4 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= VZQTR20FIN Mobility Highlights Note: Where applicable, the operating results reflect certain adjustments Consolidated Total retail postpaid net additions for the third quarter were 581 thousand, up from 388 thousand in the prior year period, driven by continued FWA momentum, wearables adoption, and strong Business and improved Consumer postpaid phone performance. Total postpaid phone net additions for the third quarter were 100 thousand, up from 8 thousand in the prior year period. • Postpaid phone gross additions were 2.6 million, up 0.8% year over year. • Postpaid phone churn was 0.90%, down 2 basis points year over year. Consumer Group Postpaid net additions for the third quarter were 251 thousand, up from 28 thousand in the prior year period, as growth in FWA and wearables was partially offset by phone and tablet losses. • Postpaid phone net losses were 51 thousand compared to 189 thousand net losses in the prior year period. ◦ Postpaid phone gross additions were 1.8 million, up 2.3% year over year, continuing the momentum that began building in the second half of last year. ◦ Postpaid phone churn was 0.85%, down 3 basis points year over year. • Prepaid net losses were 207 thousand compared to 39 thousand net additions in the prior year period. ◦ Prepaid churn was 4.39%, up 49 basis points year over year. Page 5 VZQTR20FIN Business Group Postpaid phone net additions for the third quarter were 151 thousand, down from 197 thousand in the prior year period. • Postpaid phone churn was 1.14%, up 4 basis points year over year. Broadband Highlights Total broadband net additions were 434 thousand for the third quarter, up from 377 thousand in the prior year period, driven by strong demand and good retention rates for both Fios and FWA products. • FWA net additions were 384 thousand, up from 342 thousand in the prior year period. ◦ Consumer FWA net additions were 251 thousand, up 17 thousand year over year. ◦ Business FWA net additions were 133 thousand, up 25 thousand year over year. • Fios internet net additions were 72 thousand, up from 61 thousand in the prior year period. Consumer Financial Results Page 6 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= VZQTR20FIN Total Consumer revenue for the third quarter was $25.3 billion, down 2.3% year over year, as gains in Service and other revenue were offset by Wireless equipment revenue declines. • Consumer Service and other revenue was $20.4 billion, up 0.4% year over year. • Consumer Wireless service revenue was $16.0 billion, up 2.9% year over year, driven by Consumer wireless postpaid average revenue per account (ARPA) growth, which was partially offset by decline in retail postpaid phone connections and prepaid connections. • Consumer Fios revenue was $2.9 billion, dow n 0.2% year over year. • Consumer Wireless equipment revenue was $4.9 billion, down 11.8% year over year, driven primarily by a 29.6% year over year decline in upgrades. Consumer wireless postpaid ARPA was $133.47 for the third quarter, up 4.5% year over year, driven by pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, more customers selecting premium Unlimited plans, the l arger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from Other revenue into Wireless service revenue, and an increase in our FWA subscriber base and device protection revenue, partially offset by the amortization impact on service revenue from promotional costs. Consumer operating income was $7.5 billion, up 2.7% year over year, resulting in operating income margin of 29.9%. Consumer segment EBITDA 1 was $10.8 billion, up 2.2% year over year. This improvement can be attributed to service revenue growth and lower upgrade volumes. Consumer segment EBITDA margin 1 for the third quarter was 42.8%. Page 7 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= VZQTR20FIN Business Financial Results Note: Revenue by customer group may not add due to rounding. Total Business revenue was $7.5 billion, down 4.0% year over year, driven by lower Wireline revenue and lower Wireless equipment revenue, partially offset by higher Wireless service revenue. • Business Wireless service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 2.9% year over year, driven by continued strong net additions and pricing actions implemented in recent quarters. • Business wireline results reflect continued secular declines in the prevailing wireline market and our rationalization of certain legacy wireline products, consistent with prior periods. Business operating income was $539 million, down 22.8% year over year, resulting in operating income margin of 7.2%. Business segment EBITDA 1 was $1.7 billion, down 6.2% year over year, driven by continued declines in high margin Wireline revenues. Business segment EBITDA margin 1 for the third quarter was 22.1%.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated October 24, 2023, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated October 24, 2023, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP Measures Verizon’s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset rationalization, business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Severance charges recorded during 2021 relate to voluntary separations under our existing plans. Asset rationalization relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we have made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives in 2023. Business transformation costs recorded during 2023 primarily relate to costs incurred in connection with strategic partnership initiatives in our managed network support services for certain Verizon Business customers. Non-strategic business shutdown relates to the shutdown of our BlueJeans business offering in 2023. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon’s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, business transformation costs, non-strategic business shutdown and severance, pension and benefits charges. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Forecast Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe they are more conservative measures of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow and free cash flow forecast have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and free cash flow forecast do not incorporate payments made or expected to be made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow and free cash flow forecast as complements to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow forecast is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures forecast (including capitalized software) from forecasted net cash provided by operating activities. Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of operating performance. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company’s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: business transformation costs and non-strategic business shutdown.

Total broadband net additions included 384,000 fixed wireless net additions, an increase of 42,000 fixed wireless net additions from third-quarter 2022. Verizon now has approximately 10.3 million total broadband subscribers, including nearly 2.7 million subscribers on its fixed wireless service. • 72,000 Fios Internet net additions, an increase from 61,000 Fios Internet net additions in third-quarter 2022.

NEW YORK - Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) reported third-quarter results today and raised its free cash flow guidance for the year. The company's performance was highlighted by continued wireless service revenue growth, total broadband net additions, and improving profitability. ""We continued to make steady progress in the third quarter with a clear focus on growing wireless service revenue, delivering healthy consolidated adjusted EBITDA and increasing free cash flow,"" said Verizon Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. ""Our financial discipline, combined with our healthy balance sheet, enabled us to increase our dividend for the 17th consecutive year, which is the longest current streak of dividend increases in the U.S. telecom industry."" For third-quarter 2023, Verizon reported EPS of $1.13, compared with $1.17 in third-quarter 2022. On an adjusted basis 1 , excluding special items, EPS was $1.22 in third-quarter 2023, compared with adjusted EPS 1 of $1.32 in third-quarter 2022. Third-quarter 2023 earnings reflected a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $579 million. This included the impacts of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions of $224 million, a pre-tax non-strategic business shutdown charge of $179 million related to the shutdown of the BlueJeans business offering and pre-tax business transformation costs of $176 million. Consolidated results • Total consolidated operating revenue in third-quarter 2023 of $33.3 billion, a decrease of 2.6 percent from third-quarter 2022. This decline was primarily due to reduced wireless equipment revenue and lower postpaid upgrade activity. • Total wireless service revenue 2 in third-quarter 2023 increased 2.9 percent year over year and 1.1 percent from second-quarter 2023. This increase was driven by targeted pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, the larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, and growth from fixed wireless offerings. • Net income of $4.9 billion, a decrease of 2.8 percent compared to third-quarter 2022, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA 1 of $12.2 billion, an increase of 0.2 percent year over year. • Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled $28.8 billion, an increase from $28.2 billion in 2022. This increase is related to continued working capital improvements associated with fewer upgrades and lower inventory levels, partially offset by higher interest payments. • Capital expenditures year-to-date were $14.2 billion. Page 2 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= • Free cash flow 1 year-to-date was $14.6 billion, an increase from $12.4 billion in 2022. • Verizon's unsecured debt as of the end of third-quarter 2023 decreased by $4.9 billion sequentially to $126.4 billion. The company's net unsecured debt 1 balance improved sequentially by $4.3 billion to $122.2 billion. At the end of third-quarter 2023, Verizon's ratio of unsecured debt to net income (LTM) was approximately 5.9 times, and its net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 1 was approximately 2.6 times. Verizon Consumer results • Total Verizon Consumer revenue was $25.3 billion, a decrease of 2.3 percent year over year. Growth in service and other revenue was offset by wireless equipment revenue declines. • Wireless service revenue increased 2.9 percent year over year. This increase was driven by growth in retail postpaid Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA), partially offset by a decline in retail postpaid phone connections and prepaid connections. • Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.04 percent in third-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.85 percent. • In third-quarter 2023, Consumer reported 51,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net losses, representing an improvement of 85,000 from second-quarter 2023 and 138,000 from third-quarter 2022. Consumer postpaid phone gross additions increased 2.3 percent year over year in third-quarter 2023, continuing the momentum that began in second-half 2022. • Consumer reported 207,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in third-quarter 2023. • Consumer reported 251,000 fixed wireless net additions and 69,000 Fios Internet net additions in third-quarter 2023. Consumer Fios revenue was $2.9 billion in third-quarter 2023, a decrease of 0.2 percent year over year. • In third-quarter 2023, Consumer operating income was $7.5 billion, an increase of 2.7 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 29.9 percent, an increase from 28.4 percent in third-quarter 2022. Segment EBITDA 1 in third-quarter 2023 was $10.8 billion, an increase of 2.2 percent year over year. This improvement can be attributed to wireless service revenue growth and lower upgrade volumes. Segment EBITDA margin 1 was 42.8 percent, an increase from 40.9 percent in third-quarter 2022. Verizon Business results • Total Verizon Business revenue was $7.5 billion in third-quarter 2023, a decrease of 4.0 percent year over year. Lower wireline revenue and lower wireless equipment revenue was partially offset by higher wireless service revenue. • Business wireless service revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 2.9 percent year over year. This growth was driven by continued strong net additions and pricing actions implemented in recent quarters. • Business reported 330,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in third-quarter 2023, including 151,000 postpaid phone net additions. This was the ninth consecutive quarter that Business reported more than 125,000 postpaid phone net additions. Business continues to grow volumes and expand its relationships with customers strengthening its position as a wireless market share leader. Page 3 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= • Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.47 percent in third-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.14 percent. • Business reported 133,000 fixed wireless net additions in third-quarter 2023. • In third-quarter 2023, Verizon Business operating income was $539 million, a decrease of 22.8 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 7.2 percent, a decrease from 8.9 percent in third-quarter 2022. Segment EBITDA 1 was $1.7 billion in third-quarter 2023, a decrease of 6.2 percent year over year, driven by continued declines in high margin wireline revenues. Segment EBITDA margin 1 was 22.1 percent in third-quarter 2023, a decrease from 22.7 percent in third-quarter 2022. Outlook and guidance The company does not provide a reconciliation for certain of the following adjusted (non-GAAP) forecasts because it cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise, and the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. For 2023, Verizon expects the following: • Cash flow from operations in the range of $36.25 billion to $37.25 billion. • Capital spending at the higher end of the previously guided range of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. • Free cash flow 1 above $18 billion, a $1 billion increase from the previously issued guidance. In addition, for 2023, Verizon continues to expect the following: • Total wireless service revenue growth 2 3 of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. • Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. • Adjusted EPS 1 of $4.55 to $4.85. • Adjusted effective income tax rate 1 in the range of 22.5 percent to 24.0 percent. 1 Non-GAAP financial measure. See the accompanying schedules and www.verizon.com/about/investors for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 2 Total wireless service revenue represents the sum of Consumer and Business segments. 3 Includes a benefit of approximately 190 basis points from the reallocation from other revenue to wireless service revenue. This results from a larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery charges which partly recover network operating costs. Verizon Communications Inc.

Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings. During the first quarter of 2023, Verizon reorganized the customer groups within its Business segment. Previously, this segment was comprised of four customer groups: Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale. Following the reorganization, there are now three customer groups: Enterprise and Public Sector, Business Markets and Other, and Wholesale. Enterprise and Public Sector combines the customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other (excluding BlueJeans and Connect customers) as well as the commercial wireline customers previously included in Small and Medium Business. Business Markets and Other combines the customers previously included in Small and Medium Business (excluding commercial wireline customers), the BlueJeans customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other, and the Connect customers previously included in Public Sector and Other. The Wholesale customer group remained unchanged. Prior period operating revenue results within the Business segment have been recast for these reorganized customer groups. There was no change to the composition of our reportable segments and total segment results, nor the determination of segment profit. The segment financial results and metrics above exclude the effects of special items (other than the effects of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization), which the Company’s chief operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated July 25, 2023, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated July 25, 2023, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP Measures Verizon’s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset rationalization and net gain from disposition of business. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Severance charges recorded during 2021 relate to voluntary separations under our existing plans. Asset rationalization relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we have made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives in 2023. Net gain from disposition of business relates to the sale of Verizon Media in 2021. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon’s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, severance, pension and benefits charges and asset rationalization. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of operating performance. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company’s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: severance charges and asset rationalization. See the accompanying schedules for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits (d) Exhibits.

Total wireless postpaid phone gross additions increased 2.0 percent year over year, primarily driven by a 6.9 percent year over year growth in Consumer postpaid phone gross additions. • Total retail postpaid churn of 1.07 percent, and retail postpaid phone churn of 0.83 percent. NEW YORK - Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) reported second-quarter results today highlighted by wireless service revenue growth, increased cash flow from operations and strong momentum heading into the second half of the year. ""In the second quarter, we showed progress in our key priorities of growing wireless service revenue, delivering healthy consolidated adjusted EBITDA, and increasing free cash flow,"" said Chairman and CEO Hans Vestberg. ""We look forward to extending our network leadership in the second half of the year by continuing our rapid C-Band deployment as we are laser focused on providing value to our customers. The steps that we have taken to improve our operational performance are working, and we are confident that we will achieve our financial targets for the full year."" For second-quarter 2023, Verizon reported EPS of $1.10, compared with $1.24 in second-quarter 2022. On an adjusted basis 1 , excluding special items, EPS was $1.21 in second-quarter 2023, compared with adjusted EPS 1 of $1.31 in second-quarter 2022. Second-quarter 2023 earnings reflected a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $598 million. This included a pre-tax severance charge of $237 million, the impacts of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions of $206 million, and a pre-tax asset rationalization charge of $155 million related to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that the company has decided to cease use of as part of its transformation initiatives. Consolidated results • Total consolidated operating revenue in second-quarter 2023 of $32.6 billion, a decrease of 3.5 percent from second-quarter 2022. This decrease was primarily due to reduced wireless equipment revenue and lower postpaid phone upgrade activity. • Total wireless service revenue 3 in second-quarter 2023 increased 3.8 percent year over year. This increase was driven primarily by pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, the larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, and a growing contribution from fixed wireless offerings. • Net income of $4.8 billion, a decrease of 10.3 percent compared to second-quarter 2022, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA 1 of $12.0 billion, an increase of 0.8 percent year over year. Page 2 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= • First-half 2023 cash flow from operations totaled $18.0 billion, an increase from $17.7 billion in first-half 2022. This increase continues to be related to lower receivables and lower inventory levels tied to fewer upgrades, which were offset by higher cash income taxes and interest expense. • Capital expenditures in first-half 2023 were $10.1 billion. • The company ended first-half 2023 with free cash flow 1 of $8.0 billion, an increase from $7.2 billion in first-half 2022. • Verizon's unsecured debt as of the end of second-quarter 2023 decreased by $662 million sequentially to $131.4 billion. The company's net unsecured debt 1 balance improved sequentially by $3.2 billion to $126.6 billion. At the end of second-quarter 2023, Verizon's ratio of unsecured debt to net income (LTM) was approximately 6.1 times, and its net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 1 was approximately 2.6 times. Verizon Consumer results • Total Verizon Consumer revenue was $24.6 billion, a decrease of 4.1 percent year over year. Growth in service and other revenue was offset by wireless equipment revenue declines. • Wireless service revenue increased 3.5 percent year over year. This increase was driven by growth in retail postpaid Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA), partially offset by a decline in retail postpaid phone connections and prepaid connections. • Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 0.95 percent in second-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.76 percent. • In second-quarter 2023, Consumer reported 136,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net losses. Consumer postpaid phone gross additions increased 6.9 percent year over year, and continued the momentum that began in second-half 2022. • Consumer reported 304,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in second-quarter 2023. • Consumer reported 251,000 fixed wireless net additions and 51,000 Fios Internet net additions in second-quarter 2023. Consumer Fios revenue was $2.9 billion in second-quarter 2023, a decrease of 0.3 percent year over year. • In second-quarter 2023, Consumer operating income was $7.3 billion, an increase of 2.5 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 29.8 percent, an increase from 27.9 percent in second-quarter 2022. Segment EBITDA 1 in second-quarter 2023 was $10.6 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent year over year. This improvement can be attributed to service revenue growth and lower upgrade volumes. Segment EBITDA margin 1 was 43.1 percent, an increase from 40.5 percent in second-quarter 2022. Verizon Business results • Total Verizon Business revenue was $7.5 billion in second-quarter 2023, a decrease of 1.9 percent year over year. Growth in wireless service revenue was more than offset by lower wireline revenue and lower wireless equipment revenue. • Business wireless service revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 5.3 percent year over year. This growth was driven by continued strong net additions and pricing actions implemented in recent quarters. Page 3 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= • Business reported 308,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in second-quarter 2023, including 144,000 postpaid phone net additions. This was the eighth consecutive quarter that Business reported more than 125,000 postpaid phone net additions. • Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.48 percent in second-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.10 percent. • Business reported 133,000 fixed wireless net additions in second-quarter 2023. • In second-quarter 2023, Verizon Business operating income was $533 million, a decrease of 21.0 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 7.1 percent, a decrease from 8.9 percent in second-quarter 2022. Segment EBITDA 1 was $1.6 billion in second-quarter 2023, a decrease of 6.5 percent year over year, driven by continued declines in high margin wireline revenues. Segment EBITDA margin 1 was 21.9 percent in second-quarter 2023, a decrease from 22.9 percent in second-quarter 2022. Outlook and guidance The company does not provide a reconciliation for any of the following adjusted (non-GAAP) forecasts because it cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise, and the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. For 2023, Verizon continues to expect the following: • Total wireless service revenue growth 2 3 of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. • Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. • Adjusted EPS 1 of $4.55 to $4.85. • Adjusted effective income tax rate 1 in the range of 22.5 percent to 24.0 percent. • Capital spending in the range of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. 1 Non-GAAP financial measure. See the accompanying schedules and www.verizon.com/about/investors for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 2 Includes a benefit of approximately 190 basis points from the reallocation from other revenue to wireless service revenue. This results from a larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery charges which partly recover network operating costs. 3 Total wireless service revenue represents the sum of Consumer and Business segments.

(2) Non-GAAP financial measure. Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings. During the first quarter of 2023, Verizon reorganized the customer groups within its Business segment. Previously, this segment was comprised of four customer groups: Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale. Following the reorganization, there are now three customer groups: Enterprise and Public Sector, Business Markets and Other, and Wholesale. Enterprise and Public Sector combines the customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other (excluding BlueJeans and Connect customers) as well as the commercial wireline customers previously included in Small and Medium Business. Business Markets and Other combines the customers previously included in Small and Medium Business (excluding commercial wireline customers), the BlueJeans customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other, and the Connect customers previously included in Public Sector and Other. The Wholesale customer group remained unchanged. Prior period operating revenue results within the Business segment have been recast for these reorganized customer groups. There was no change to the composition of our reportable segments and total segment results, nor the determination of segment profit. The segment financial results and metrics above exclude the effects of special items (other than the effects of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization), which the Company’s chief operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance.

(Verizon) for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023 contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is included at the end of this document and is also contained in Verizon's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated Financial Results * Non-GAAP financial measure. ** Total Wireless service revenue represents the sum of Consumer and Business segments. Consolidated total operating revenue for the second quarter was $32.6 billion, down 3.5% year over year. • Service and other revenue was $27.3 billion, up 0.8% year over year, as the growth of Wireless service revenue was partially offset by wireline declines and lower Other revenue due to the reallocation of certain fees. ◦ Total Wireless service revenue 2 was $19.1 billion, up 3.8% year over year, driven primarily by pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from Other revenue into Wireless service revenue, Page 2 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= and growing contribution from our fixed wireless access (FWA) offerings. ◦ Total Fios revenue was $3.2 billion, relatively flat year over year as the benefits of Fios internet customer growth were more than offset by declines in voice and video connections. • Wireless equipment revenue was $5.3 billion, down 20.9% year over year, predominantly due to lower upgrade rates. Consolidated net income for the second quarter was $4.8 billion, down 10.3% year over year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA 1 for the second quarter was $12.0 billion, up 0.8% year over year, driven by W ireless service revenue growth and lower upgrade rates. Consolidated operating expenses for the second quarter were $25.4 billion, down 3.3% year over year. Consolidated operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and special items, 1 were $20.6 billion, down 5.9% year over year. Interest expense for the second quarter was $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion the first quarter 2023 due to higher interest rates on our outstanding debt balance. Earnings per share (EPS) was $1.10, down 11.3% year over year. • Reported second quarter earnings reflect a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $598 million. This includes a pre-tax severance charge of $237 million, the impacts of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone Wireless, Inc. and other acquisitions of $206 million, and a pre-tax asset rationalization charge of $155 million related to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we have made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives. A djusted EPS 1 was $1.21, down 7.6% year over year. Page 3 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= Cash Flow Summary * Non-GAAP financial measure. Cash flow from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $18.0 billion compared to $17.7 billion in the prior year period driven by working capital improvements as a result of lower receivables and lower inventory levels tied to fewer upgrades, which were offset by higher cash income taxes and interest expense. • Capital spending for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $10.1 billion, including the remaining $1.75 billion of the C-Band related spending in our guidance. • Our guidance for 2023 capital expenditures of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion remains unchanged. Free cash flow 1 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $8.0 billion . Total unsecured debt as of the end of the second quarter was $131.4 billion, a $0.7 billion improvement compared to the prior quarter and $1.1 billion lower year over year. Unsecured debt to net income (LTM) ratio was 6.1x as of the end of the second quarter, an increase of 0.1x compared to the prior quarter and a 0.1x improvement year over year. Net unsecured debt 1 as of the end of the second quarter was $126.6 billion, a $3.2 billion improvement compared to the prior quarter and $4.1 billion lower year over year. Net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 1 was 2.6x as of the end of the second quarter, a 0.1x improvement both sequentially and year over year. Page 4 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= Mobility Highlights Consolidated Total retail postpaid net additions for the second quarter were 612 thousand, up from 514 thousand in the prior year period, driven by continued FWA momentum, wearables adoption, and strong Business phone performance. Total postpaid phone net additions for the second quarter were 8 thousand, down from 12 thousand in the prior year period. • Postpaid phone gross additions were 2.3 million, up 2.0% year over year. • Postpaid phone churn was 0.83%, up 2 basis points year over year. Consumer Group Postpaid net additions for the second quarter were 304 thousand, up from 84 thousand in the prior year period, as growth in FWA and wearables was partially offset by phone and tablet losses. • Postpaid phone net losses were 136 thousand compared to 215 thousand net losses in the prior year period. ◦ Postpaid phone gross additions were 1.6 million, up 6.9% year over year, continuing the momentum that began building in the second half of last year. ◦ Postpaid phone churn was 0.76%, up 1 basis point year over year. • Prepaid net losses were 304 thousand compared to 229 thousand net losses in the prior year period. ◦ Prepaid churn was 4.24%, up 34 basis points year over year. Business Group Postpaid phone net additions for the second quarter were 144 thousand, down from 227 thousand in the prior year period. • Postpaid phone churn was 1.10%, up 3 basis points year over year. Page 5 Broadband Highlights Total broadband net additions were 418 thousand for the second quarter, up from 268 thousand in the prior year period, driven by strong demand and good retention rates for both Fios and FWA products. • FWA net additions were 384 thousand, up from 256 thousand in the prior year period. ◦ Consumer FWA net additions were 251 thousand, up 83 thousand year over year. ◦ Business FWA net additions were 133 thousand, up 45 thousand year over year. • Fios internet net additions were 54 thousand, up from 36 thousand in the prior year period. Consumer Financial Results Total Consumer revenue for the second quarter was $24.6 billion, down 4.1% year over year, as gains in Service and other revenue were offset by Wireless equipment revenue declines. Page 6 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= • Consumer Service and other revenue was $20.1 billion, up 1.2% year over year. • Consumer Wireless service revenue was $15.8 billion, up 3.5% year over year, driven by Consumer wireless postpaid average revenue per account (ARPA) growth, which was partially offset by decline in retail postpaid phone connections and prepaid connections. • Consumer Fios revenue was $2.9 billion, dow n 0.3% year over year, as the benefits of Fios internet customer growth were more than offset by declines in voice and video connections. • Consumer Wireless equipment revenue was $4.4 billion, down 22.4% year over year, driven primarily by a 38% year over year decline in upgrades. Consumer wireless postpaid ARPA was $131.83 for the second quarter, up 6.2% year over year, driven by pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, and the larger allocation of our administrative and telco recovery fees from Other revenue into Wireless service revenue, as well as an increase in our FWA subscriber base and device protection revenue, partially offset by the amortization impact on service revenue from promotional costs. Consumer operating income was $7.3 billion, up 2.5% year over year, resulting in operating income margin of 29.8%. Consumer segment EBITDA 1 was $10.6 billion, up 2.1% year over year. This improvement can be attributed to service revenue growth and lower upgrade volumes. Consumer segment EBITDA margin 1 for the second quarter was 43.1%. Business Financial Results * Referred to in the first quarter 2023 as ""Business Markets and SaaS"". Page 7 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= Total Business revenue was $7.5 billion, down 1.9% year over year, as growth in Wireless service revenue was more than offset by lower Wireline revenue and lower Wireless equipment revenue. • Business Wireless service revenue was $3.4 billion, up 5.3% year over year, driven by continued strong net additions and pricing actions implemented in recent quarters. • Business wireline results reflect continued secular declines in the prevailing wireline market and our rationalization of certain legacy wireline products, consistent with prior periods. Business operating income was $533 million, down 21.0% year over year, resulting in operating income margin of 7.1%. Business segment EBITDA 1 was $1.6 billion, down 6.5% year over year, driven by continued declines in high margin Wireline revenues. Business segment EBITDA margin 1 for the second quarter was 21.9%.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition Attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto are a press release and financial tables, dated July 25, 2023, issued by Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon). Attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto is commentary, dated July 25, 2023, discussing Verizon's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP Measures Verizon’s press release, financial tables and commentary attached to the report include financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) as well as non-GAAP financial information. It is management's intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Verizon's GAAP financial information and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures in addition to the GAAP measures allows management, investors and other users of our financial information to more fully and accurately assess both consolidated and segment performance. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies and may not be directly comparable to that of other companies. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Related Non-GAAP Measures Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information as they are widely accepted financial measures used in evaluating the profitability of a company and its operating performance in relation to its competitors. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense to net income. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back segment depreciation and amortization expense to segment operating income. Segment EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Segment EBITDA by total segment operating revenues. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. We believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast are used by investors to compare a company’s operating performance to its competitors by minimizing impacts caused by differences in capital structure, taxes and depreciation and amortization policies. Further, the exclusion of non-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from Consolidated EBITDA the effect of the following non-operational items: equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated businesses and other income and expense, net, and the following special items: severance charges, asset rationalization and net gain from disposition of business. Severance charges recorded during 2023 and 2022 relate to involuntary separations under our existing plans. Severance charges recorded during 2021 relate to voluntary separations under our existing plans. Asset rationalization relates to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that we have made a decision to cease use of as part of our transformation initiatives in 2023. Net gain from disposition of business relates to the sale of Verizon Media in 2021. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio Net Unsecured Debt and Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating Verizon’s ability to service its unsecured debt from continuing operations. Net Unsecured Debt is calculated by subtracting secured debt and cash and cash equivalents from the sum of debt maturing within one year and long-term debt. Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio is calculated by dividing Net Unsecured Debt by Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of Net Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated for the last twelve months. Adjusted Earnings per Common Share (Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EPS Forecast Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EPS Forecast are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating results and understanding our operating trends without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. We believe excluding special items provides more comparable assessment of our financial results from period to period. Adjusted EPS is calculated by excluding from the calculation of reported EPS the effect of the following special items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, severance, pension and benefits charges and asset rationalization. We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe that it is important for investors to understand that our non-GAAP financial measure adjusts for the intangible asset amortization but does not adjust the revenue that is generated in part from the use of such intangible assets. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted EPS Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate Attributable to Verizon Forecast (Adjusted ETR Forecast) Adjusted ETR Forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in assessing our effective income tax rate without the effect of special items which could vary from period to period. Adjusted ETR Forecast is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by net income attributable to Verizon before tax after adjusting for the effect of special items. We have not provided a reconciliation for our Adjusted ETR Forecast because we cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise during 2023. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for acquisitions of businesses or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. Consolidated Operating Expenses Excluding Depreciation and Amortization and Special Items Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating our operating expenses and underlying operating trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of operating performance. We believe that consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is used by investors to more accurately compare a company’s operating expenses to those of its competitors by eliminating impacts caused by differences in depreciation and amortization policies. In addition, the exclusion of the effects of special items allows for better comparability of our financial results from period to period. Consolidated operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and special items is calculated by excluding from consolidated operating expenses the effects of depreciation and amortization expense and the following special items: severance charges and asset rationalization. See the accompanying schedules for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP. Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits (d) Exhibits.

The steps that we have taken to improve our operational performance are working, and we are confident that we will achieve our financial targets for the full year."" For second-quarter 2023, Verizon reported EPS of $1.10, compared with $1.24 in second-quarter 2022. On an adjusted basis 1 , excluding special items, EPS was $1.21 in second-quarter 2023, compared with adjusted EPS 1 of $1.31 in second-quarter 2022. Second-quarter 2023 earnings reflected a pre-tax loss from special items of approximately $598 million. This included a pre-tax severance charge of $237 million, the impacts of amortization of intangible assets related to TracFone and other acquisitions of $206 million, and a pre-tax asset rationalization charge of $155 million related to certain real estate and non-strategic assets that the company has decided to cease use of as part of its transformation initiatives. Consolidated results • Total consolidated operating revenue in second-quarter 2023 of $32.6 billion, a decrease of 3.5 percent from second-quarter 2022. This decrease was primarily due to reduced wireless equipment revenue and lower postpaid phone upgrade activity. • Total wireless service revenue 3 in second-quarter 2023 increased 3.8 percent year over year. This increase was driven primarily by pricing actions implemented in recent quarters, the larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery fees from other revenue into wireless service revenue, and a growing contribution from fixed wireless offerings. • Net income of $4.8 billion, a decrease of 10.3 percent compared to second-quarter 2022, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA 1 of $12.0 billion, an increase of 0.8 percent year over year. Page 2 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= • First-half 2023 cash flow from operations totaled $18.0 billion, an increase from $17.7 billion in first-half 2022. This increase continues to be related to lower receivables and lower inventory levels tied to fewer upgrades, which were offset by higher cash income taxes and interest expense. • Capital expenditures in first-half 2023 were $10.1 billion. • The company ended first-half 2023 with free cash flow 1 of $8.0 billion, an increase from $7.2 billion in first-half 2022. • Verizon's unsecured debt as of the end of second-quarter 2023 decreased by $662 million sequentially to $131.4 billion. The company's net unsecured debt 1 balance improved sequentially by $3.2 billion to $126.6 billion. At the end of second-quarter 2023, Verizon's ratio of unsecured debt to net income (LTM) was approximately 6.1 times, and its net unsecured debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 1 was approximately 2.6 times. Verizon Consumer results • Total Verizon Consumer revenue was $24.6 billion, a decrease of 4.1 percent year over year. Growth in service and other revenue was offset by wireless equipment revenue declines. • Wireless service revenue increased 3.5 percent year over year. This increase was driven by growth in retail postpaid Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA), partially offset by a decline in retail postpaid phone connections and prepaid connections. • Consumer wireless retail postpaid churn was 0.95 percent in second-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 0.76 percent. • In second-quarter 2023, Consumer reported 136,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net losses. Consumer postpaid phone gross additions increased 6.9 percent year over year, and continued the momentum that began in second-half 2022. • Consumer reported 304,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in second-quarter 2023. • Consumer reported 251,000 fixed wireless net additions and 51,000 Fios Internet net additions in second-quarter 2023. Consumer Fios revenue was $2.9 billion in second-quarter 2023, a decrease of 0.3 percent year over year. • In second-quarter 2023, Consumer operating income was $7.3 billion, an increase of 2.5 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 29.8 percent, an increase from 27.9 percent in second-quarter 2022. Segment EBITDA 1 in second-quarter 2023 was $10.6 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent year over year. This improvement can be attributed to service revenue growth and lower upgrade volumes. Segment EBITDA margin 1 was 43.1 percent, an increase from 40.5 percent in second-quarter 2022. Verizon Business results • Total Verizon Business revenue was $7.5 billion in second-quarter 2023, a decrease of 1.9 percent year over year. Growth in wireless service revenue was more than offset by lower wireline revenue and lower wireless equipment revenue. • Business wireless service revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 5.3 percent year over year. This growth was driven by continued strong net additions and pricing actions implemented in recent quarters. Page 3 VlpHU09DSUQyMDE5UTE= • Business reported 308,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in second-quarter 2023, including 144,000 postpaid phone net additions. This was the eighth consecutive quarter that Business reported more than 125,000 postpaid phone net additions. • Business wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.48 percent in second-quarter 2023, and wireless retail postpaid phone churn was 1.10 percent. • Business reported 133,000 fixed wireless net additions in second-quarter 2023. • In second-quarter 2023, Verizon Business operating income was $533 million, a decrease of 21.0 percent year over year, and segment operating income margin was 7.1 percent, a decrease from 8.9 percent in second-quarter 2022. Segment EBITDA 1 was $1.6 billion in second-quarter 2023, a decrease of 6.5 percent year over year, driven by continued declines in high margin wireline revenues. Segment EBITDA margin 1 was 21.9 percent in second-quarter 2023, a decrease from 22.9 percent in second-quarter 2022. Outlook and guidance The company does not provide a reconciliation for any of the following adjusted (non-GAAP) forecasts because it cannot, without unreasonable effort, predict the special items that could arise, and the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. For 2023, Verizon continues to expect the following: • Total wireless service revenue growth 2 3 of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. • Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $47.0 billion to $48.5 billion. • Adjusted EPS 1 of $4.55 to $4.85. • Adjusted effective income tax rate 1 in the range of 22.5 percent to 24.0 percent. • Capital spending in the range of $18.25 billion to $19.25 billion. 1 Non-GAAP financial measure. See the accompanying schedules and www.verizon.com/about/investors for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 2 Includes a benefit of approximately 190 basis points from the reallocation from other revenue to wireless service revenue. This results from a larger allocation of administrative and telco recovery charges which partly recover network operating costs. 3 Total wireless service revenue represents the sum of Consumer and Business segments.

Enterprise and Public Sector combines the customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other (excluding BlueJeans and Connect customers) as well as the commercial wireline customers previously included in Small and Medium Business. Business Markets and Other combines the customers previously included in Small and Medium Business (excluding commercial wireline customers), the BlueJeans customers previously included in Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other, and the Connect customers previously included in Public Sector and Other. The Wholesale customer group remained unchanged. Prior period operating revenue results within the Business segment have been recast for these reorganized customer groups. There was no change to the composition of our reportable segments and total segment results, nor the determination of segment profit. The segment financial results and metrics above exclude the effects of special items (other than the effects of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization), which the Company’s chief operating decision maker does not consider in assessing segment performance. Certain intersegment transactions with corporate entities have not been eliminated. Verizon Communications Inc.

Emerging growth company ☐ If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. ☐ Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On August 14, 2019, Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco) reported its results of operations for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 ended July 27, 2019. A copy of the press release issued by Cisco concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Cisco, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibit includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP interest and other income (loss), net, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Ciscos results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Ciscos results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. For its internal budgeting process, Ciscos management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies (such as legal and indemnification settlements and the supplier component remediation amounts), gains and losses on equity investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. Ciscos management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. Cisco divested the Service Provider Video Software Solutions (SPVSS) business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 on October 28, 2018. The attached exhibit includes, where indicated, financial measures that exclude the SPVSS business. Cisco believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations because the SPVSS business is no longer part of and will not be part of Cisco on a go forward basis. Ciscos management also uses the financial measures excluding the SPVSS business in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. As described above, Cisco excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee restricted stock and restricted stock units, employee stock options, and employee stock purchase rights, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. Cisco excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and Cisco believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets . Cisco incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. Such intangible assets may include purchased intangible assets with finite lives, capitalized in process research and development and goodwill. Cisco excludes these items because Cisco does not believe these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from Ciscos prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of Ciscos business. Acquisition-related/divestiture costs . In connection with its business combinations, Cisco incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time Cisco enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. Cisco may also from time to time incur gains or losses from divestitures of a business area as well as professional fees and other direct expenses associated with such transactions. Cisco excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are related to acquisitions and divestitures and have no direct correlation to the operation of Ciscos business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings . Cisco from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. Cisco excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Significant litigation settlements and other contingencies . Cisco from time to time may incur charges or benefits related to significant litigation settlements and other contingencies. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Gains and losses on equity investments. Cisco does not actively trade equity securities nor does it plan on these investments for funding of ongoing operations, and investments. Cisco excludes gains and losses on these investments because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing . This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. Cisco may incur tax charges or benefits that are (i) related to prior periods or (ii) not reflective of its ongoing provision for income taxes. These tax charges or benefits may be the result of events such as changes in tax legislation (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), court decisions, and/or tax settlements. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Cisco will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and gains and losses on equity investments, in future periods. Significant asset impairments, restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, and divestiture costs could occur in future periods. Cisco could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

The returns on our investments in key strategic areas position Cisco for long-term growth and shareholder value. 2 Financial Summary All comparative percentages are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.

These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding future events (such as our ability to deliver tremendous innovation across our portfolio and extend our market leadership, our ability to provide our customers ongoing value through differentiated solutions, our ability to take advantage of the long-term growth opportunities ahead, the transformation of our business model with software subscriptions, and our investments in key strategic areas to position Cisco for long-term growth and shareholder value) and the future financial performance of Cisco (including the guidance for Q1 FY 2020) that involve risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including: business and economic conditions and growth trends in the networking industry, our customer markets and various geographic regions; global economic conditions and uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; overall information technology spending; the growth and evolution of the Internet and levels of capital spending on Internet-based systems; variations in customer demand for products and services, including sales to the service provider market and other customer markets; the return on our investments in certain priorities, key growth areas, and in certain geographical locations, as well as maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services; the timing of orders and manufacturing and customer lead times; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; variability of component costs; variations in sales channels, product costs or mix of products sold; our ability to successfully acquire businesses and technologies and to successfully integrate and operate these acquired businesses and technologies; our ability to achieve expected benefits of our partnerships; increased competition in our product and service markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; manufacturing and sourcing risks; product defects and returns; litigation involving patents, intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters, and governmental investigations; our ability to achieve the benefits of the announced restructuring and possible changes in the size and timing of the related charges; cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware; vulnerabilities and critical security defects; terrorism; natural catastrophic events; a pandemic or epidemic; our ability to achieve the benefits anticipated from our investments in sales, engineering, service, marketing and manufacturing activities; our ability to recruit and retain key personnel; our ability to manage financial risk, and to manage expenses during economic downturns; risks related to the global nature of our operations, including our operations in emerging markets; currency fluctuations and other international factors; changes in provision for income taxes, including changes in tax laws and regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our income tax returns; potential volatility in operating results; and other factors listed in Ciscos most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed on May 21, 2019 and September 6, 2018, respectively. The financial information contained in this release should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Ciscos most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K as each may be amended from time to time. Ciscos results of operations for the three months and the year ended July 27, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of Ciscos operating results for any future periods. Any projections in this release are based on limited information currently available to Cisco, which is subject to change. Although any such projections and the factors influencing them will likely change, Cisco will not necessarily update the information, since Cisco will only provide guidance at certain points during the year. Such information speaks only as of the date of this release. This release includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP interest and other income (loss), net, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Ciscos results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Ciscos results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. For its internal budgeting process, Ciscos management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, gains and losses on 18 equity investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing and significant tax matters. Ciscos management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. For additional information on the items excluded by Cisco from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cisco divested its Service Provider Video Software Solutions business (SPVSS) during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 on October 28, 2018. This release includes, where indicated, financial measures that exclude the SPVSS business. Cisco believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations because the SPVSS business will not be part of Cisco on a go forward basis. Ciscos management also uses the financial measures excluding the SPVSS business in reviewing the financial results of Cisco.

Emerging growth company ☐ If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. ☐ Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On August 14, 2019, Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco) reported its results of operations for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 ended July 27, 2019. A copy of the press release issued by Cisco concerning the foregoing results is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Cisco, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The attached exhibit includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP interest and other income (loss), net, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Ciscos results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Ciscos results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. For its internal budgeting process, Ciscos management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies (such as legal and indemnification settlements and the supplier component remediation amounts), gains and losses on equity investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing, and significant tax matters. Ciscos management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. Cisco divested the Service Provider Video Software Solutions (SPVSS) business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 on October 28, 2018. The attached exhibit includes, where indicated, financial measures that exclude the SPVSS business. Cisco believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations because the SPVSS business is no longer part of and will not be part of Cisco on a go forward basis. Ciscos management also uses the financial measures excluding the SPVSS business in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. As described above, Cisco excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable: Share-based compensation expense. These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee restricted stock and restricted stock units, employee stock options, and employee stock purchase rights, including such expenses associated with acquisitions. Cisco excludes share-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and Cisco believes that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of share-based compensation to its results of operations. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets . Cisco incurs amortization of intangible assets (which may include impairment charges from the write-downs of purchased intangible assets) in connection with acquisitions. Such intangible assets may include purchased intangible assets with finite lives, capitalized in process research and development and goodwill. Cisco excludes these items because Cisco does not believe these expenses are reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. These amounts arise from Ciscos prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the operation of Ciscos business. Acquisition-related/divestiture costs . In connection with its business combinations, Cisco incurs compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, as well as professional fees and other direct expenses such as restructuring activities related to the acquired company. In addition, from time to time Cisco enters into foreign currency transactions related to pending acquisitions, and may incur gains or losses on such transactions. Cisco may also from time to time incur gains or losses from divestitures of a business area as well as professional fees and other direct expenses associated with such transactions. Cisco excludes such compensation expense, changes to the fair value of contingent consideration, fees, other direct expenses, and gains and losses, as they are related to acquisitions and divestitures and have no direct correlation to the operation of Ciscos business. Significant asset impairments and restructurings . Cisco from time to time incurs significant asset impairments, restructuring charges, and gains or losses on asset disposals. Cisco excludes these items, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Significant litigation settlements and other contingencies . Cisco from time to time may incur charges or benefits related to significant litigation settlements and other contingencies. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Gains and losses on equity investments. Cisco does not actively trade equity securities nor does it plan on these investments for funding of ongoing operations, and investments. Cisco excludes gains and losses on these investments because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. Income tax effects of the foregoing . This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Significant tax matters. Cisco may incur tax charges or benefits that are (i) related to prior periods or (ii) not reflective of its ongoing provision for income taxes. These tax charges or benefits may be the result of events such as changes in tax legislation (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), court decisions, and/or tax settlements. Cisco excludes these charges or benefits, when significant, because it does not believe they are reflective of ongoing business and operating results. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that Cisco may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Cisco will incur share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and gains and losses on equity investments, in future periods. Significant asset impairments, restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, and divestiture costs could occur in future periods. Cisco could also be impacted by significant tax matters in future periods. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding future events (such as our ability to deliver tremendous innovation across our portfolio and extend our market leadership, our ability to provide our customers ongoing value through differentiated solutions, our ability to take advantage of the long-term growth opportunities ahead, the transformation of our business model with software subscriptions, and our investments in key strategic areas to position Cisco for long-term growth and shareholder value) and the future financial performance of Cisco (including the guidance for Q1 FY 2020) that involve risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results due to a variety of factors, including: business and economic conditions and growth trends in the networking industry, our customer markets and various geographic regions; global economic conditions and uncertainties in the geopolitical environment; overall information technology spending; the growth and evolution of the Internet and levels of capital spending on Internet-based systems; variations in customer demand for products and services, including sales to the service provider market and other customer markets; the return on our investments in certain priorities, key growth areas, and in certain geographical locations, as well as maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services; the timing of orders and manufacturing and customer lead times; changes in customer order patterns or customer mix; insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory; variability of component costs; variations in sales channels, product costs or mix of products sold; our ability to successfully acquire businesses and technologies and to successfully integrate and operate these acquired businesses and technologies; our ability to achieve expected benefits of our partnerships; increased competition in our product and service markets, including the data center market; dependence on the introduction and market acceptance of new product offerings and standards; rapid technological and market change; manufacturing and sourcing risks; product defects and returns; litigation involving patents, intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters, and governmental investigations; our ability to achieve the benefits of the announced restructuring and possible changes in the size and timing of the related charges; cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware; vulnerabilities and critical security defects; terrorism; natural catastrophic events; a pandemic or epidemic; our ability to achieve the benefits anticipated from our investments in sales, engineering, service, marketing and manufacturing activities; our ability to recruit and retain key personnel; our ability to manage financial risk, and to manage expenses during economic downturns; risks related to the global nature of our operations, including our operations in emerging markets; currency fluctuations and other international factors; changes in provision for income taxes, including changes in tax laws and regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our income tax returns; potential volatility in operating results; and other factors listed in Ciscos most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K filed on May 21, 2019 and September 6, 2018, respectively. The financial information contained in this release should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Ciscos most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K as each may be amended from time to time. Ciscos results of operations for the three months and the year ended July 27, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of Ciscos operating results for any future periods. Any projections in this release are based on limited information currently available to Cisco, which is subject to change. Although any such projections and the factors influencing them will likely change, Cisco will not necessarily update the information, since Cisco will only provide guidance at certain points during the year. Such information speaks only as of the date of this release. This release includes non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income and margin, non-GAAP effective tax rates, non-GAAP interest and other income (loss), net, and non-GAAP net income per share data for the periods presented. It also includes future estimated ranges for gross margin, operating margin, tax provision rate and EPS on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Cisco believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Ciscos results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Ciscos results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Cisco believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations. For its internal budgeting process, Ciscos management uses financial statements that do not include, when applicable, share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, acquisition-related/divestiture costs, significant asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, gains and losses on 18 equity investments, the income tax effects of the foregoing and significant tax matters. Ciscos management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the financial results of Cisco. In prior periods, Cisco has excluded other items that it no longer excludes for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. From time to time in the future there may be other items that Cisco may exclude for purposes of its internal budgeting process and in reviewing its financial results. For additional information on the items excluded by Cisco from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cisco divested its Service Provider Video Software Solutions business (SPVSS) during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 on October 28, 2018. This release includes, where indicated, financial measures that exclude the SPVSS business. Cisco believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and its historical and projected results of operations because the SPVSS business will not be part of Cisco on a go forward basis. Ciscos management also uses the financial measures excluding the SPVSS business in reviewing the financial results of Cisco.

On July 9, 2019, Cisco Systems, Inc. ( Cisco ) announced its entry into a definitive agreement for Cisco to acquire Acacia Communications, Inc. ( Acacia ). Acacia designs and manufactures high-speed, optical interconnect technologies that allow webscale companies, service providers, and data center operators to meet the fast-growing consumer demands for data. Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco has agreed to acquire Acacia for $70.00 per share in cash, or for approximately $2.6 billion on a fully diluted basis, net of cash and marketable securities. The acquisition has been approved by the board of directors of each company. The acquisition is expected to close during the second half of Ciscos fiscal year 2020, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review. Prior to the completion of the transaction, Cisco and Acacia will continue to operate as separate companies. Upon completion of the transaction, Acacia employees will join Ciscos Optical Systems and Optics business within the Networking and Security business under David Goeckeler. On July 9, 2019, Cisco and Acacia issued a joint press release relating to the transaction. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. This filing may be deemed to contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (including statements containing the words believes, plans, anticipates, expects, estimates and similar expressions) should be considered to be forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include statements regarding the expected benefits to Cisco, Acacia and their respective customers from completing the acquisition, integration of Acacias technology into Ciscos networking portfolio, the expected completion of the acquisition, the expected financial performance of Cisco following the expected completion of the acquisition, and plans regarding Acacia personnel.
