SoundThinking, Inc. Date: November 7, 2023 By: /s/ Ralph A. Clark Ralph A. Clark President and Chief Executive Officer -;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 SoundThinking, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenues Increased 28% to a Record $24.0 Million, Marking Highest Quarterly Level in Company History Company Reaffirms FY 2023 Revenue Guidance to a Range of $92 Million to $94 Million, Representing 15% Year-Over-Year Growth at the Midpoint and Retains FY 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Margin Guidance at a Range of 16 to 18% FREMONT, CA – November 7, 2023 – SoundThinking, Inc. (Nasdaq: SSTI) a leading public safety technology company, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. Third Quarter 2023 Financial and Operational Highlights 1 See the section below titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to GAAP net income (loss). Financial Outlook The company reaffirms its full year 2023 revenue guidance range of $92 million to $94 million, representing approximately 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint compared to 2022. Management retains its expectation for Adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 16% to 18% of revenue in 2023. The company expects its annual recurring revenue (ARR) on 12/31/2023 to have increased over 17% to approximately $93.5 million, up from $79.7 million on 12/31/2022. The company’s financial outlook statements are based on current expectations. The preceding statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement” below. The company has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net income (loss) due to the uncertainty and variability of interest income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income (loss). Because the company cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) is not available without unreasonable effort. Such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net income (loss). For more information, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Management Commentary “The third quarter marked another strong period for SoundThinking, highlighted by a 28% increase in revenue and 33% increase in gross profit compared to the prior year quarter along with solid Adjusted EBITDA profitability,” said President and CEO Ralph Clark. “Our record quarterly revenue was driven by new and expanding customer subscriptions, including deployments in seven new cities and expansions in three current customers. We still expect to go live in over 140 miles in 2023. Based on our results for the first nine months of the year, we remain confident in achieving our guidance and entering 2024 with solid momentum. “Our recent acquisition of SafePointe extended our SafetySmart Platform and ability to positively impact public safety outcomes while expanding our addressable market and potentially accelerating SoundThinking’s growth potential. We are already benefiting from the various synergies that SafePointe provides, including some cross-selling opportunities across our combined customer base. “We remain committed to driving positive public safety outcomes for communities across the country. Our second annual ESG report showcases our mission to facilitate law enforcement’s application of technology solutions to promote social good. We are proud of the work we are doing at SoundThinking and look forward to continuing to help innovate and transform the public safety and private sectors. Overall, with the expansion of our product portfolio and a growing need for public safety solutions, we remain confident in our ability to drive profitable growth.” Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenues for the third quarter of 2023 were $24.0 million, compared to $18.8 million for the same quarter of 2022. The increase in revenues was primarily due to new and expanding customer subscriptions as well as contribution from the SafePointe acquisition, which was acquired on August 18, 2023. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2023 was $13.8 million (57% of revenues), compared to $10.3 million (55% of revenues) for the same period in 2022. Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2023 were $15.2 million, compared to $6.2 million for the same period in 2022. Operating expenses increased primarily due to higher personnel-related costs as we continue to grow our business and higher than expected legal expenses. Additionally, operating expenses for the third quarter of 2022 was offset by a contingent consideration reduction of $5.4 million related to the Forensic Logic acquisition. Net loss for the third quarter of 2023 totaled $1.9 million or $(0.15) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.5 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), compared to net income of $4.0 million or $0.33 per basic and diluted share (based on 12.2 million basic and 12.4 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, respectively), for the same period in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 totaled $4.3 million, compared to $3.1 million in the same period last year. At quarter end, the company had $5.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $25.0 million in accounts receivable and contract assets, net, $38.3 million in deferred revenue, $7.0 million in debt related to our SafePointe acquisition, and approximately $18.0 million available on its credit facility.

U.S. replay dial-in: 1-844-512-2921 International replay dial-in: 1-412-317-6671 Replay ID: 10022590 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted net income (loss): Adjusted net income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the company’s net income (loss) before acquisition-related expenses, including adjustments to the company's contingent consideration obligation. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the company’s net income (loss) before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, including adjustments to the company's contingent consideration obligation. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management internally to understand and evaluate the company’s core operating performance and trends across accounting periods and in connection with developing future operating plans, making strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and considering initiatives focused on cultivating new markets for its solutions. In particular, the exclusion of these expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of the company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis. SoundThinking believes adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA also provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. For example, SoundThinking adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses because such expenses often vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in a particular period. Stock-based compensation is utilized by SoundThinking to attract and retain employees with a goal of long-term retention and the alignment of employee interests with those of the company and its stockholders, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period’s financial performance measures, in particular net income (loss), or its other GAAP financial results.

U.S. replay dial-in: 1-844-512-2921 International replay dial-in: 1-412-317-6671 Replay ID: 10022590 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted net income (loss): Adjusted net income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the company’s net income (loss) before acquisition-related expenses, including adjustments to the company's contingent consideration obligation. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the company’s net income (loss) before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, including adjustments to the company's contingent consideration obligation. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management internally to understand and evaluate the company’s core operating performance and trends across accounting periods and in connection with developing future operating plans, making strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and considering initiatives focused on cultivating new markets for its solutions. In particular, the exclusion of these expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of the company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis. SoundThinking believes adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA also provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. For example, SoundThinking adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses because such expenses often vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in a particular period. Stock-based compensation is utilized by SoundThinking to attract and retain employees with a goal of long-term retention and the alignment of employee interests with those of the company and its stockholders, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period’s financial performance measures, in particular net income (loss), or its other GAAP financial results.

Reports Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Company Reaffirms FY 2023 Revenue Guidance to a Range of $92 Million to $94 Million, Representing 15% Year-Over-Year Growth at the Midpoint and Reduces FY 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Margin Guidance to a Range of 16 to 18% Company Expects to Go Live with Approximately 140 Miles in FY 2023, Up 37% Compared to FY 2022 FREMONT, CA – August 8, 2023 – SoundThinking, Inc. (Nasdaq: SSTI) (formerly ShotSpotter, Inc.), a leading public safety technology company that combines data-driven solutions and strategic advisory services for law enforcement and civic leadership, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023. Second Quarter 2023 Financial and Operational Highlights 1 See the section below titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to GAAP net income (loss). Financial Outlook The company reaffirms its full year 2023 revenue guidance range of $92 million to $94 million, representing approximately 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint compared to 2022. Management reduces its expectation for Adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 16% to 18% of forecasted revenue in 2023. The company’s financial outlook statements are based on current expectations. The preceding statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement” below. The company has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net (loss) income due to the uncertainty and variability of interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related expenses, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net (loss) income. Because the company cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation to forecasted GAAP net income is not available without unreasonable effort. Such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net (loss) income. For more information, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Management Commentary “The second quarter marked a strong consecutive period for SoundThinking, highlighted by record quarterly revenue of $22.1 million along with another quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA,” said President and CEO Ralph Clark. “During the second quarter, we went 'live' with eight new customers, expanded with eight customers, and added two new CaseBuilder contracts, putting us on track to go live with approximately 140 total miles in 2023. ""Our corporate rebrand to SoundThinking has reinforced our solutions-based holistic approach towards public safety, coupling community and law enforcement agencies with our expanding SafetySmart platform. The recent enhancements we introduced to CrimeTracer (formerly COPLINK X), our advanced analytics-fueled law enforcement search engine, has streamlined our customers’ workflows, enabling greater efficiency and seamless data integration across our platform. We continue to build a strong pipeline for each investigative solution and are encouraged by the demand we are seeing across our target growth markets. An increased emphasis on digital transformation has permeated the public sector, and the continued willingness of officials and community leaders to allocate assets to public safety initiatives works in our favor. “Our team remains hyper-focused on taking advantage of cross-selling opportunities and finding greater points of efficiency and development avenues within our existing ecosystem of technology. We believe our recent recognition as a ‘Top 100 Fastest-Growing Company’ in a competitive market like the Greater Bay Area is indicative of the growing demand for transformative public safety solutions, and our company’s dedication to meeting that demand. Overall, we are confident in our ability to drive profitable growth by capitalizing on the increasing demand for our SafetySmart Platform that assists law enforcement to be more efficient, effective, and equitable in driving positive public safety outcomes.” Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenues for the second quarter of 2023 were $22.1 million, compared to $20.0 million for the same quarter of 2022. The increase in revenues was primarily due to new and expanding customer subscriptions. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2023 was $12.7 million (57% of revenues), compared to $11.6 million (58% of revenues) for the same period in 2022. Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2023 were $15.0 million, compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2022. Operating expenses increased primarily due to increased personnel-related costs and legal expenses as we continue to grow our business and some non-recurring items, including approximately $0.5 million related to a company-wide all-hands meeting associated with our rebranding launch, over $0.8 million in accelerated intangible amortization, and a $0.2 million write-off related to unpaid invoices for Puerto Rico. Operating expenses for the second quarter of both 2023 and 2022 were offset by contingent consideration reductions of $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, related to the potential earnout payments related to the Forensic Logic acquisition. Net loss for the second quarter of 2023 totaled $2.7 million or $(0.22) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.2 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), compared to net income of $3.0 million, or $0.25 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share (based on 12.1 million basic and 12.3 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), for the same period in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2023 totaled $2.4 million, compared to $4.1 million in the same period last year. At quarter-end, the company had $3.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $27.6 million in accounts receivable and contract asset, net, no debt, and approximately $25.0 million available on its line of credit.

SoundThinking, Inc. Date: August 8, 2023 By: /s/ Ralph A. Clark Ralph A. Clark President and Chief Executive Officer ","EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 SoundThinking, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Company Reaffirms FY 2023 Revenue Guidance to a Range of $92 Million to $94 Million, Representing 15% Year-Over-Year Growth at the Midpoint and Reduces FY 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Margin Guidance to a Range of 16 to 18% Company Expects to Go Live with Approximately 140 Miles in FY 2023, Up 37% Compared to FY 2022 FREMONT, CA – August 8, 2023 – SoundThinking, Inc. (Nasdaq: SSTI) (formerly ShotSpotter, Inc.), a leading public safety technology company that combines data-driven solutions and strategic advisory services for law enforcement and civic leadership, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023. Second Quarter 2023 Financial and Operational Highlights 1 See the section below titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to GAAP net income (loss). Financial Outlook The company reaffirms its full year 2023 revenue guidance range of $92 million to $94 million, representing approximately 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint compared to 2022. Management reduces its expectation for Adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 16% to 18% of forecasted revenue in 2023. The company’s financial outlook statements are based on current expectations. The preceding statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement” below. The company has not reconciled its Adjusted EBITDA outlook to GAAP net (loss) income due to the uncertainty and variability of interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition related expenses, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net (loss) income. Because the company cannot reasonably predict such items, a reconciliation to forecasted GAAP net income is not available without unreasonable effort. Such items could have a significant impact on the calculation of GAAP net (loss) income. For more information, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Management Commentary “The second quarter marked a strong consecutive period for SoundThinking, highlighted by record quarterly revenue of $22.1 million along with another quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA,” said President and CEO Ralph Clark. “During the second quarter, we went 'live' with eight new customers, expanded with eight customers, and added two new CaseBuilder contracts, putting us on track to go live with approximately 140 total miles in 2023. ""Our corporate rebrand to SoundThinking has reinforced our solutions-based holistic approach towards public safety, coupling community and law enforcement agencies with our expanding SafetySmart platform. The recent enhancements we introduced to CrimeTracer (formerly COPLINK X), our advanced analytics-fueled law enforcement search engine, has streamlined our customers’ workflows, enabling greater efficiency and seamless data integration across our platform. We continue to build a strong pipeline for each investigative solution and are encouraged by the demand we are seeing across our target growth markets. An increased emphasis on digital transformation has permeated the public sector, and the continued willingness of officials and community leaders to allocate assets to public safety initiatives works in our favor. “Our team remains hyper-focused on taking advantage of cross-selling opportunities and finding greater points of efficiency and development avenues within our existing ecosystem of technology. We believe our recent recognition as a ‘Top 100 Fastest-Growing Company’ in a competitive market like the Greater Bay Area is indicative of the growing demand for transformative public safety solutions, and our company’s dedication to meeting that demand. Overall, we are confident in our ability to drive profitable growth by capitalizing on the increasing demand for our SafetySmart Platform that assists law enforcement to be more efficient, effective, and equitable in driving positive public safety outcomes.” Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenues for the second quarter of 2023 were $22.1 million, compared to $20.0 million for the same quarter of 2022. The increase in revenues was primarily due to new and expanding customer subscriptions. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2023 was $12.7 million (57% of revenues), compared to $11.6 million (58% of revenues) for the same period in 2022. Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2023 were $15.0 million, compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2022. Operating expenses increased primarily due to increased personnel-related costs and legal expenses as we continue to grow our business and some non-recurring items, including approximately $0.5 million related to a company-wide all-hands meeting associated with our rebranding launch, over $0.8 million in accelerated intangible amortization, and a $0.2 million write-off related to unpaid invoices for Puerto Rico. Operating expenses for the second quarter of both 2023 and 2022 were offset by contingent consideration reductions of $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, related to the potential earnout payments related to the Forensic Logic acquisition. Net loss for the second quarter of 2023 totaled $2.7 million or $(0.22) per basic and diluted share (based on 12.2 million basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), compared to net income of $3.0 million, or $0.25 per basic and $0.24 per diluted share (based on 12.1 million basic and 12.3 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding), for the same period in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2023 totaled $2.4 million, compared to $4.1 million in the same period last year. At quarter-end, the company had $3.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $27.6 million in accounts receivable and contract asset, net, no debt, and approximately $25.0 million available on its line of credit.

U.S. replay dial-in: 1-844-512-2921 International replay dial-in: 1-412-317-6671 Replay ID: 91300311 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted net income (loss): Adjusted net income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the company’s net income (loss) before acquisition-related expenses, including adjustments to the company's contingent consideration obligation. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents the company’s net income (loss) before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses, including adjustments to the company's contingent consideration obligation. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management internally to understand and evaluate the company’s core operating performance and trends across accounting periods and in connection with developing future operating plans, making strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and considering initiatives focused on cultivating new markets for its solutions. In particular, the exclusion of these expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of the company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis. SoundThinking believes adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA also provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. For example, SoundThinking adjusts EBITDA for stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses because such expenses often vary for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and operational performance in a particular period. Stock-based compensation is utilized by SoundThinking to attract and retain employees with a goal of long-term retention and the alignment of employee interests with those of the company and its stockholders, rather than to address operational performance for any particular period’s financial performance measures, in particular net income (loss), or its other GAAP financial results.

Change Pharmaceutical Revenue Third-quarter pharmaceutical sales were $11.1 billion, an increase of 15% compared with the third quarter of 2018; excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales grew 16% in the third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology and vaccines, partially offset by the ongoing impacts of the loss of market exclusivity for several products as well as lower sales of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCI). International pharmaceutical sales represented 54% of total sales in the quarter. Performance in international markets was led by China, which had pharmaceutical sales of $898 million representing growth of 84% compared with the third quarter of 2018, driven by vaccines, primarily GARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and GARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant), and oncology. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, pharmaceutical sales in China grew by 90%. Page 5 Growth in oncology was largely driven by a $1.2 billion increase in sales for KEYTRUDA to $3.1 billion, reflecting strong momentum from the NSCLC indications as well as continued uptake in other indications, including the recently launched RCC and adjuvant melanoma indications, along with growth from Lynparza and Lenvima. Growth in vaccines reflects higher sales of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV, primarily due to higher demand in Asia Pacific, particularly in China. Also contributing to sales growth was higher demand in Europe, driven primarily by increased vaccination rates for both boys and girls, as well as higher pricing and demand in the United States, partially offset by public sector buying patterns. In October 2019, the company borrowed doses of GARDASIL 9 from the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile, which will reduce GARDASIL 9 sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 by approximately $120 million. These doses will be allocated to support routine vaccination in the United States and will allow the company to manufacture doses for other parts of the world, including regions where some of the most vulnerable populations live. Growth in pediatric vaccines was driven by VARIVAX (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox, and PROQUAD (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, reflecting higher demand and pricing in the United States and higher demand in Europe and Latin America. Performance in hospital acute care reflects higher demand globally, particularly in the United States, for BRIDION (sugammadex) Injection 100 mg/mL, a medicine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in adults undergoing surgery; and the ongoing launch of PREVYMIS (letermovir), a medicine for prophylaxis (prevention) of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Pharmaceutical sales growth for the quarter was partially offset by the ongoing impacts from the loss of market exclusivity for INVANZ (ertapenem sodium), ZETIA (ezetimibe) and VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin), CUBICIN (daptomycin) and REMICADE (infliximab). In addition, the decline in sales of JANUVIA and JANUMET reflects continued pricing pressure in the United States, which more than offset higher demand globally. Page 6 Animal Health Revenue Animal Health sales totaled $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 10% compared with the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, Animal Health sales grew 12%. Growth in the third quarter was primarily driven by livestock, due to products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition, along with growth from companion animal products, driven largely by higher sales of the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) line of products for parasitic control. Animal Health segment profits were $423 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 4% compared with $409 million in the third quarter of 2018. 3 Third-Quarter Expense, EPS and Related Information The tables below present selected expense information. $ in millions GAAP Restructuring Costs Certain Other Items Non-GAAP 2 GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information Gross margin was 67.8% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 66.5% for the third quarter of 2018. The increase in gross margin for the third quarter of 2019 reflects the favorable impacts of a charge in 2018 related to the termination of a collaboration agreement with Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. and product mix, partially offset by higher acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the impact of a 2019 intangible asset impairment charge, higher amortization of unfavorable manufacturing variances, higher amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations, higher restructuring costs, as well as manufacturing facilities startup costs. 3 Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting, Merck does not allocate general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segment, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. 4 Includes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories recognized as a result of acquisitions, intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Also includes integration, transaction and certain other costs related to business acquisitions and divestitures. Page 7 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2019, a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher promotion and administrative costs primarily in support of strategic brands, and higher acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 55% compared with the third quarter of 2018. The increase was driven primarily by a $982 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2019 for the acquisition of Peloton coupled with higher expenses related to clinical development and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. Other (income) expense, net, was $35 million of expense in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $172 million of income in the third quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting lower income from investments in equity securities and higher net interest expense. The effective income tax rate of 18.7% for the third quarter of 2019 includes the unfavorable impact of the charge for the acquisition of Peloton for which no tax benefit was recognized and the favorable impact of product mix. GAAP EPS was $0.74 for the third quarter of 2019 compared with $0.73 for the third quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information The non-GAAP gross margin was 75.9% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 76.7% for the third quarter of 2018. The decrease in non-GAAP gross margin primarily reflects higher amortization of unfavorable manufacturing variances, higher amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations, as well as manufacturing facilities startup costs. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2019, a 5% increase compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase reflects higher promotion and administrative costs primarily in support of strategic brands, partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019, a 7% increase compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher expenses related to clinical development and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. Page 8 Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $29 million of expense in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $162 million of income in the third quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting lower income from investments in equity securities and higher net interest expense. The non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 15.7% for the third quarter of 2019 reflects the favorable impact of product mix. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.51 for the third quarter of 2019 compared with $1.19 for the third quarter of 2018. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income and EPS is provided in the table that follows. Financial Outlook Merck narrowed and raised its full-year 2019 revenue range to be between $46.5 billion and $47.0 billion, including both the impact of the GARDASIL 9 stockpile borrowing noted above and a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% at mid-October exchange rates. Merck reduced its expected full-year GAAP effective tax rate to approximately 16.5% and its expected full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate to approximately 17.5%. These reductions are primarily attributable to favorable product mix. 5 Represents the difference between calculated GAAP EPS and calculated non-GAAP EPS, which may be different than the amount calculated by dividing the impact of the excluded items by the weighted-average shares for the period. Page 9 Merck narrowed and reduced its full-year 2019 GAAP EPS range to be between $3.75 and $3.80. The change in the GAAP EPS range primarily reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge noted above. Merck narrowed and raised its full-year 2019 non-GAAP EPS range to be between $5.12 and $5.17, including a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1% at mid-October exchange rates. The non-GAAP range excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to restructuring programs, a net benefit from the settlement of certain federal income tax matters, the charge for the acquisition of Peloton and certain other items. The following table summarizes the company’s full-year 2019 financial guidance. *The company does not have any non-GAAP adjustments to revenue. **EPS guidance for 2019 assumes a share count (assuming dilution) of approximately 2.6 billion shares. . A reconciliation of anticipated 2019 GAAP EPS to non-GAAP EPS and the items excluded from non-GAAP EPS are provided in the table below. 750 982 The expected full-year GAAP effective tax rate of 16.5% reflects a net favorable impact of approximately one percentage point from the above items.

Pipeline Highlights Oncology Merck continued to advance the development programs for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), the company’s anti-PD-1 therapy; Lynparza (olaparib), a PARP inhibitor being co-developed and co-commercialized with AstraZeneca; and Lenvima (lenvatinib mesylate), an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor being co-developed and co-commercialized with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai). KEYTRUDA Page 2 Page 3 Lynparza Lenvima Other Pipeline Highlights Page 4 Third-Quarter Revenue Performance The following table reflects sales of the company’s top pharmaceutical products, as well as sales of animal health products. Change Pharmaceutical Revenue Third-quarter pharmaceutical sales were $11.1 billion, an increase of 15% compared with the third quarter of 2018; excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales grew 16% in the third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology and vaccines, partially offset by the ongoing impacts of the loss of market exclusivity for several products as well as lower sales of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCI). International pharmaceutical sales represented 54% of total sales in the quarter. Performance in international markets was led by China, which had pharmaceutical sales of $898 million representing growth of 84% compared with the third quarter of 2018, driven by vaccines, primarily GARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and GARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant), and oncology. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, pharmaceutical sales in China grew by 90%. Page 5 Growth in oncology was largely driven by a $1.2 billion increase in sales for KEYTRUDA to $3.1 billion, reflecting strong momentum from the NSCLC indications as well as continued uptake in other indications, including the recently launched RCC and adjuvant melanoma indications, along with growth from Lynparza and Lenvima. Growth in vaccines reflects higher sales of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV, primarily due to higher demand in Asia Pacific, particularly in China. Also contributing to sales growth was higher demand in Europe, driven primarily by increased vaccination rates for both boys and girls, as well as higher pricing and demand in the United States, partially offset by public sector buying patterns. In October 2019, the company borrowed doses of GARDASIL 9 from the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile, which will reduce GARDASIL 9 sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 by approximately $120 million. These doses will be allocated to support routine vaccination in the United States and will allow the company to manufacture doses for other parts of the world, including regions where some of the most vulnerable populations live. Growth in pediatric vaccines was driven by VARIVAX (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox, and PROQUAD (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, reflecting higher demand and pricing in the United States and higher demand in Europe and Latin America. Performance in hospital acute care reflects higher demand globally, particularly in the United States, for BRIDION (sugammadex) Injection 100 mg/mL, a medicine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in adults undergoing surgery; and the ongoing launch of PREVYMIS (letermovir), a medicine for prophylaxis (prevention) of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Pharmaceutical sales growth for the quarter was partially offset by the ongoing impacts from the loss of market exclusivity for INVANZ (ertapenem sodium), ZETIA (ezetimibe) and VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin), CUBICIN (daptomycin) and REMICADE (infliximab). In addition, the decline in sales of JANUVIA and JANUMET reflects continued pricing pressure in the United States, which more than offset higher demand globally. Page 6 Animal Health Revenue Animal Health sales totaled $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 10% compared with the third quarter of 2018. Excluding the unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, Animal Health sales grew 12%. Growth in the third quarter was primarily driven by livestock, due to products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition, along with growth from companion animal products, driven largely by higher sales of the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) line of products for parasitic control. Animal Health segment profits were $423 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 4% compared with $409 million in the third quarter of 2018. 3 Third-Quarter Expense, EPS and Related Information The tables below present selected expense information. $ in millions GAAP Restructuring Costs Certain Other Items Non-GAAP 2 GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information Gross margin was 67.8% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 66.5% for the third quarter of 2018. The increase in gross margin for the third quarter of 2019 reflects the favorable impacts of a charge in 2018 related to the termination of a collaboration agreement with Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. and product mix, partially offset by higher acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the impact of a 2019 intangible asset impairment charge, higher amortization of unfavorable manufacturing variances, higher amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations, higher restructuring costs, as well as manufacturing facilities startup costs. 3 Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting, Merck does not allocate general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segment, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. 4 Includes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories recognized as a result of acquisitions, intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Also includes integration, transaction and certain other costs related to business acquisitions and divestitures. Page 7 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2019, a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher promotion and administrative costs primarily in support of strategic brands, and higher acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 55% compared with the third quarter of 2018. The increase was driven primarily by a $982 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2019 for the acquisition of Peloton coupled with higher expenses related to clinical development and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. Other (income) expense, net, was $35 million of expense in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $172 million of income in the third quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting lower income from investments in equity securities and higher net interest expense. The effective income tax rate of 18.7% for the third quarter of 2019 includes the unfavorable impact of the charge for the acquisition of Peloton for which no tax benefit was recognized and the favorable impact of product mix. GAAP EPS was $0.74 for the third quarter of 2019 compared with $0.73 for the third quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information The non-GAAP gross margin was 75.9% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 76.7% for the third quarter of 2018. The decrease in non-GAAP gross margin primarily reflects higher amortization of unfavorable manufacturing variances, higher amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations, as well as manufacturing facilities startup costs. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2019, a 5% increase compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase reflects higher promotion and administrative costs primarily in support of strategic brands, partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019, a 7% increase compared to the third quarter of 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher expenses related to clinical development and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. Page 8 Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $29 million of expense in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $162 million of income in the third quarter of 2018 primarily reflecting lower income from investments in equity securities and higher net interest expense. The non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 15.7% for the third quarter of 2019 reflects the favorable impact of product mix. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.51 for the third quarter of 2019 compared with $1.19 for the third quarter of 2018. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income and EPS is provided in the table that follows. Financial Outlook Merck narrowed and raised its full-year 2019 revenue range to be between $46.5 billion and $47.0 billion, including both the impact of the GARDASIL 9 stockpile borrowing noted above and a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% at mid-October exchange rates. Merck reduced its expected full-year GAAP effective tax rate to approximately 16.5% and its expected full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate to approximately 17.5%. These reductions are primarily attributable to favorable product mix. 5 Represents the difference between calculated GAAP EPS and calculated non-GAAP EPS, which may be different than the amount calculated by dividing the impact of the excluded items by the weighted-average shares for the period. Page 9 Merck narrowed and reduced its full-year 2019 GAAP EPS range to be between $3.75 and $3.80. The change in the GAAP EPS range primarily reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge noted above. Merck narrowed and raised its full-year 2019 non-GAAP EPS range to be between $5.12 and $5.17, including a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1% at mid-October exchange rates. The non-GAAP range excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to restructuring programs, a net benefit from the settlement of certain federal income tax matters, the charge for the acquisition of Peloton and certain other items. The following table summarizes the company’s full-year 2019 financial guidance. *The company does not have any non-GAAP adjustments to revenue. **EPS guidance for 2019 assumes a share count (assuming dilution) of approximately 2.6 billion shares. . A reconciliation of anticipated 2019 GAAP EPS to non-GAAP EPS and the items excluded from non-GAAP EPS are provided in the table below. 750 982 The expected full-year GAAP effective tax rate of 16.5% reflects a net favorable impact of approximately one percentage point from the above items.

Second-Quarter Revenue Performance The following table reflects sales of the companys top pharmaceutical products, as well as sales of animal health products. 5 Second Quarter $ in millions 2019 2018 Change Change Ex- Exchange Total Sales $ 11,760 $ 10,465 12 % 15 % Pharmaceutical 10,460 9,282 13 % 17 % KEYTRUDA 2,634 1,667 58 % 63 % JANUVIA / JANUMET 1,441 1,535 -6 % -3 % GARDASIL / GARDASIL 9 886 608 46 % 50 % PROQUAD, M-M-R II and VARIVAX 675 426 58 % 61 % BRIDION 278 240 16 % 20 % ISENTRESS / ISENTRESS HD 247 305 -19 % -13 % NUVARING 240 236 2 % 3 % ZETIA / VYTORIN 232 381 -39 % -36 % SIMPONI 214 233 -8 % -1 % ROTATEQ 172 156 10 % 13 % Animal Health 1,124 1,090 3 % 9 % Livestock 671 633 6 % 13 % Companion Animals 453 457 -1 % 4 % Other Revenues 176 93 88 % -62 % Pharmaceutical Revenue Second-quarter pharmaceutical sales were $10.5 billion, an increase of 13% compared with the second quarter of 2018; excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales grew 17% in the second quarter. The increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology and vaccines, partially offset by the ongoing impacts of the loss of market exclusivity for several products. International pharmaceutical sales represented 55% of total sales in the quarter. Performance in international markets was led by China, which had pharmaceutical sales of $745 million representing growth of 41% compared with the second quarter of 2018, driven by oncology and vaccines. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, pharmaceutical sales in China grew by 51%. Growth in oncology was largely driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in sales for KEYTRUDA to $2.6 billion, reflecting strong momentum from the NSCLC indications as well as continued uptake in other indications, including the recently launched RCC and adjuvant melanoma indications, along with growth from Lynparza and Lenvima. Growth in vaccines reflects higher sales of GARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and GARDASIL 9, vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV, primarily due to public sector buying patterns, demand and pricing in the United States, and the ongoing commercial launch in China. Higher demand in Europe, driven primarily by increased vaccination rates for both boys and girls, also contributed to sales growth. Growth in pediatric vaccines was driven by M-M-R II (Measles, Mumps and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live), a vaccine to help prevent measles, mumps and rubella; VARIVAX 6 (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox; and PROQUAD (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella; reflecting higher demand, including private-sector buy-in, and pricing in the United States; government tenders in Latin America and higher demand in Europe. Performance in hospital acute care reflects strong demand in the United States for BRIDION (sugammadex) Injection 100 mg/mL, a medicine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in adults undergoing surgery; and the ongoing launch of PREVYMIS (letermovir), a medicine for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Pharmaceutical sales growth for the quarter was partially offset by the ongoing impacts from the loss of market exclusivity for ZETIA (ezetimibe) and VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin), INVANZ (ertapenem sodium) and REMICADE (infliximab). In addition, the decline in sales of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCI) reflects continued pricing pressure in the United States, which more than offset higher demand globally. Animal Health Revenue Animal Health sales totaled $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 3% compared with the second quarter of 2018. Excluding the unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, Animal Health sales grew 9%. Growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by livestock, predominantly due to products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition. Companion animal sales performance reflects volume growth in vaccine and insulin products, partially offset by the timing of customer purchases in the prior year for the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) line of products for parasitic control. Animal Health segment profits were $405 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of 10% compared with $450 million in the second quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. (3) Second-Quarter Expense, EPS and Related Information The tables below present selected expense information. (3) Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting, Merck does not allocate general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segment, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. 7 $ in millions GAAP Acquisition- and Divestiture- Related Costs (4) Restructuring Costs Certain Other Items Non-GAAP (2) Second-Quarter 2019 Cost of sales $ 3,401 $ 447 $ 65 $  $ 2,889 Selling, general and administrative 2,712 61 32  2,619 Research and development 2,189 4 3  2,182 Restructuring costs 59  59   Other (income) expense, net 140 148  48 (56 ) Second-Quarter 2018 Cost of sales $ 3,417 $ 733 $ 3 $  $ 2,681 Selling, general and administrative 2,508 16 1  2,491 Research and development 2,274 1 3 344 1,926 Restructuring costs 228  228   Other (income) expense, net (48 ) 105  (32 ) (121 ) GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information Gross margin was 71.1% for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 67.3% for the second quarter of 2018. The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, favorable product mix and lower amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations, partially offset by higher restructuring costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.7 billion in the second quarter of 2019, an 8% increase compared to the second quarter of 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher administrative, acquisition- and divestiture-related, restructuring and promotion costs, partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019, a decline of 4% compared with the second quarter of 2018. The decline was driven primarily by lower expenses related to business development transactions, largely reflecting a $344 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to the Viralytics Limited acquisition. The decline was partially offset by higher expenses related to clinical development and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. Other (income) expense, net, was $140 million of expense in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $48 million of income in the second quarter of 2018. Other (income) expense, net, in the second quarter of 2019 reflects impairment charges and lower income from investments in equity securities. (4) Includes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories recognized as a result of acquisitions, intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Also includes integration, transaction and certain other costs related to business acquisitions and divestitures. 8 GAAP EPS was $1.03 for the second quarter of 2019 compared with $0.63 for the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information The non-GAAP gross margin was 75.4% for the second quarter of 2019, compared to 74.4% for the second quarter of 2018. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin reflects favorable product mix and lower amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2019, a 5% increase compared to the second quarter of 2018. The increase reflects higher administrative and promotion costs, partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019, a 13% increase compared to the second quarter of 2018. The increase reflects higher expenses related to clinical development, investment in discovery research and early drug development, as well as business development transactions. Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $56 million of income in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $121 million of income in the second quarter of 2018, driven primarily by lower income from investments in equity securities. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.30 for the second quarter of 2019 compared with $1.06 for the second quarter of 2018. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income and EPS is provided in the table that follows. 9 Second Quarter $ in millions, except EPS amounts 2019 2018 EPS GAAP EPS $ 1.03 $ 0.63 Difference (5) 0.27 0.43 Non-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below (2) $ 1.30 $ 1.06 Net Income GAAP net income (1) $ 2,670 $ 1,707 Difference 686 1,147 Non-GAAP net income that excludes items listed below (1),(2) $ 3,356 $ 2,854 Decrease (Increase) in Net Income Due to Excluded Items: Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs (4) $ 660 $ 855 Restructuring costs 159 235 Charge for the acquisition of Viralytics  344 Other 48 (32 ) Net decrease (increase) in income before taxes 867 1,402 Estimated income tax (benefit) expense (145 ) (255 ) Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs attributable to noncontrolling interests (36 )  Decrease (increase) in net income $ 686 $ 1,147 Financial Outlook Merck narrowed and raised its full-year 2019 revenue range to be between $45.2 billion and $46.2 billion , including a negative impact from foreign exchange of slightly more than 1% at mid-July exchange rates. Merck narrowed and reduced its full-year 2019 GAAP EPS range to be between $3.78 and $3.88. The reduction in the GAAP EPS range primarily reflects the inclusion of an approximately $1.1 billion charge related to the acquisition of Peloton. Merck narrowed and raised its full-year 2019 non-GAAP EPS range to be between $4.84 and $4.94, including a slightly negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-July exchange rates. The non-GAAP range excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to restructuring programs, a net benefit from the settlement of certain federal income tax matters, the charge for the acquisition of Peloton and certain other items. The following table summarizes the companys full year 2019 financial guidance.

This information should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a description of the items, see Table 2a attached to this release. 2 express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] >1) or in combination with platinum and fluorouracil (FU), a commonly used chemotherapy regimen, based on overall survival results from the KEYNOTE-048 trial; and · Treatment of patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy based on the results from the KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-028 trials. · Merck announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion for KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib as a first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on the findings from the pivotal KEYNOTE-426 trial. · Merck announced that the FDA has accepted for review six supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) to update the dosing frequency for KEYTRUDA to include an every-six-weeks (Q6W) dosing schedule option for certain monotherapy indications. The FDA has set a PDUFA date of Feb. 18, 2020. · Merck presented five-year survival data for KEYTRUDA in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the first KEYNOTE trial (Phase 1b KEYNOTE-001) and updated overall survival analysis and new data for disease progression after next-line treatment (progression-free survival2) from the KEYNOTE-189 trial in metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. · Merck announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-522 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy met the primary endpoint of pathological complete response (pCR) following the neoadjuvant part of the neoadjuvant/adjuvant study regimen in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The trial will continue to evaluate the other dual-primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS). Results will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Lynparza · Merck and AstraZeneca announced approval of Lynparza in Japan and separately in the European Union for use as first-line maintenance therapy in patients with BRCA -mutated advanced ovarian cancer based on the results of the Phase 3 SOLO-1 trial. Lynparza is the only PARP inhibitor approved for this indication and the only PARP inhibitor approved in Japan. · Merck and AstraZeneca presented results from the Phase 3 POLO trial in patients with germline BRCA -mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer whose disease had not progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy. In the trial, Lynparza reduced the risk of disease progression or death by nearly half (47%). These results were presented at the 2019 ASCO annual meeting and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine . 3 · Merck and AstraZeneca also presented results from the Phase 3 SOLO3 trial at the 2019 ASCO annual meeting. This study evaluated the objective response rate of Lynparza compared to chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed germline BRCA 1/2-mutated advanced ovarian cancer, who have received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Lenvima · Merck and Eisai announced receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima combination regimen for potential first-line treatment of patients with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma not amenable to loco-regional treatment, representing the third such designation. Vaccines · Merck announced the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDCs) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination with GARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant) based on shared clinical decision making for individuals ages 27 through 45 who are not adequately vaccinated. The ACIP also voted to expand routine and catch-up recommendations for males through age 26 who are not adequately vaccinated. · Merck presented Phase 2 trial results of V114, the companys investigational 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which demonstrated noninferiority to PCV 13 for all shared serotypes and an immune response for two additional disease-causing serotypes, 22F and 33F in healthy infants.

Second-Quarter Revenue Performance The following table reflects sales of the companys top pharmaceutical products, as well as sales of animal health products. 5 Second Quarter $ in millions 2019 2018 Change Change Ex- Exchange Total Sales $ 11,760 $ 10,465 12 % 15 % Pharmaceutical 10,460 9,282 13 % 17 % KEYTRUDA 2,634 1,667 58 % 63 % JANUVIA / JANUMET 1,441 1,535 -6 % -3 % GARDASIL / GARDASIL 9 886 608 46 % 50 % PROQUAD, M-M-R II and VARIVAX 675 426 58 % 61 % BRIDION 278 240 16 % 20 % ISENTRESS / ISENTRESS HD 247 305 -19 % -13 % NUVARING 240 236 2 % 3 % ZETIA / VYTORIN 232 381 -39 % -36 % SIMPONI 214 233 -8 % -1 % ROTATEQ 172 156 10 % 13 % Animal Health 1,124 1,090 3 % 9 % Livestock 671 633 6 % 13 % Companion Animals 453 457 -1 % 4 % Other Revenues 176 93 88 % -62 % Pharmaceutical Revenue Second-quarter pharmaceutical sales were $10.5 billion, an increase of 13% compared with the second quarter of 2018; excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales grew 17% in the second quarter. The increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology and vaccines, partially offset by the ongoing impacts of the loss of market exclusivity for several products. International pharmaceutical sales represented 55% of total sales in the quarter. Performance in international markets was led by China, which had pharmaceutical sales of $745 million representing growth of 41% compared with the second quarter of 2018, driven by oncology and vaccines. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, pharmaceutical sales in China grew by 51%. Growth in oncology was largely driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in sales for KEYTRUDA to $2.6 billion, reflecting strong momentum from the NSCLC indications as well as continued uptake in other indications, including the recently launched RCC and adjuvant melanoma indications, along with growth from Lynparza and Lenvima. Growth in vaccines reflects higher sales of GARDASIL [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant] and GARDASIL 9, vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by HPV, primarily due to public sector buying patterns, demand and pricing in the United States, and the ongoing commercial launch in China. Higher demand in Europe, driven primarily by increased vaccination rates for both boys and girls, also contributed to sales growth. Growth in pediatric vaccines was driven by M-M-R II (Measles, Mumps and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live), a vaccine to help prevent measles, mumps and rubella; VARIVAX 6 (Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox; and PROQUAD (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella; reflecting higher demand, including private-sector buy-in, and pricing in the United States; government tenders in Latin America and higher demand in Europe. Performance in hospital acute care reflects strong demand in the United States for BRIDION (sugammadex) Injection 100 mg/mL, a medicine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in adults undergoing surgery; and the ongoing launch of PREVYMIS (letermovir), a medicine for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Pharmaceutical sales growth for the quarter was partially offset by the ongoing impacts from the loss of market exclusivity for ZETIA (ezetimibe) and VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin), INVANZ (ertapenem sodium) and REMICADE (infliximab). In addition, the decline in sales of JANUVIA (sitagliptin) and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCI) reflects continued pricing pressure in the United States, which more than offset higher demand globally. Animal Health Revenue Animal Health sales totaled $1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 3% compared with the second quarter of 2018. Excluding the unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, Animal Health sales grew 9%. Growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by livestock, predominantly due to products acquired in the Antelliq acquisition. Companion animal sales performance reflects volume growth in vaccine and insulin products, partially offset by the timing of customer purchases in the prior year for the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) line of products for parasitic control. Animal Health segment profits were $405 million in the second quarter of 2019, a decrease of 10% compared with $450 million in the second quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. (3) Second-Quarter Expense, EPS and Related Information The tables below present selected expense information. (3) Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting, Merck does not allocate general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segment, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. 7 $ in millions GAAP Acquisition- and Divestiture- Related Costs (4) Restructuring Costs Certain Other Items Non-GAAP (2) Second-Quarter 2019 Cost of sales $ 3,401 $ 447 $ 65 $  $ 2,889 Selling, general and administrative 2,712 61 32  2,619 Research and development 2,189 4 3  2,182 Restructuring costs 59  59   Other (income) expense, net 140 148  48 (56 ) Second-Quarter 2018 Cost of sales $ 3,417 $ 733 $ 3 $  $ 2,681 Selling, general and administrative 2,508 16 1  2,491 Research and development 2,274 1 3 344 1,926 Restructuring costs 228  228   Other (income) expense, net (48 ) 105  (32 ) (121 ) GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information Gross margin was 71.1% for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 67.3% for the second quarter of 2018. The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was primarily driven by lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, favorable product mix and lower amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations, partially offset by higher restructuring costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.7 billion in the second quarter of 2019, an 8% increase compared to the second quarter of 2018. The increase primarily reflects higher administrative, acquisition- and divestiture-related, restructuring and promotion costs, partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Research and development (R&D) expenses were $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019, a decline of 4% compared with the second quarter of 2018. The decline was driven primarily by lower expenses related to business development transactions, largely reflecting a $344 million charge recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to the Viralytics Limited acquisition. The decline was partially offset by higher expenses related to clinical development and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. Other (income) expense, net, was $140 million of expense in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $48 million of income in the second quarter of 2018. Other (income) expense, net, in the second quarter of 2019 reflects impairment charges and lower income from investments in equity securities. (4) Includes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories recognized as a result of acquisitions, intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Also includes integration, transaction and certain other costs related to business acquisitions and divestitures. 8 GAAP EPS was $1.03 for the second quarter of 2019 compared with $0.63 for the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information The non-GAAP gross margin was 75.4% for the second quarter of 2019, compared to 74.4% for the second quarter of 2018. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin reflects favorable product mix and lower amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.6 billion in the second quarter of 2019, a 5% increase compared to the second quarter of 2018. The increase reflects higher administrative and promotion costs, partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2019, a 13% increase compared to the second quarter of 2018. The increase reflects higher expenses related to clinical development, investment in discovery research and early drug development, as well as business development transactions. Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $56 million of income in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $121 million of income in the second quarter of 2018, driven primarily by lower income from investments in equity securities. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.30 for the second quarter of 2019 compared with $1.06 for the second quarter of 2018. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income and EPS is provided in the table that follows. 9 Second Quarter $ in millions, except EPS amounts 2019 2018 EPS GAAP EPS $ 1.03 $ 0.63 Difference (5) 0.27 0.43 Non-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below (2) $ 1.30 $ 1.06 Net Income GAAP net income (1) $ 2,670 $ 1,707 Difference 686 1,147 Non-GAAP net income that excludes items listed below (1),(2) $ 3,356 $ 2,854 Decrease (Increase) in Net Income Due to Excluded Items: Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs (4) $ 660 $ 855 Restructuring costs 159 235 Charge for the acquisition of Viralytics  344 Other 48 (32 ) Net decrease (increase) in income before taxes 867 1,402 Estimated income tax (benefit) expense (145 ) (255 ) Acquisition- and divestiture-related costs attributable to noncontrolling interests (36 )  Decrease (increase) in net income $ 686 $ 1,147 Financial Outlook Merck narrowed and raised its full-year 2019 revenue range to be between $45.2 billion and $46.2 billion , including a negative impact from foreign exchange of slightly more than 1% at mid-July exchange rates. Merck narrowed and reduced its full-year 2019 GAAP EPS range to be between $3.78 and $3.88. The reduction in the GAAP EPS range primarily reflects the inclusion of an approximately $1.1 billion charge related to the acquisition of Peloton. Merck narrowed and raised its full-year 2019 non-GAAP EPS range to be between $4.84 and $4.94, including a slightly negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-July exchange rates. The non-GAAP range excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to restructuring programs, a net benefit from the settlement of certain federal income tax matters, the charge for the acquisition of Peloton and certain other items.
