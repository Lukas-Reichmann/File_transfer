Business Company Overview and Strategy Our Mission and our Industry’s Evolution Gogo is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. We have served this market for more than 25 years. Our mission is to enrich the lives of passengers and the efficiency of operators with the world’s best business aviation in-flight connectivity and customer support. We have always sought to provide the best connectivity for the business aviation market regardless of technology, and we have a successful history of doing so. Until recently, we focused primarily on business aviation aircraft in North America, which comprise approximately 63% of the worldwide business aviation fleet, and we are the leading provider of in-flight connectivity in that market. Gogo started in analogue air-to-ground (“ATG”) technology in the late 1990s, then, as analogue cellular backhaul disappeared, migrated to narrowband satellite connectivity in the early 2000s, then back to ATG with our digital broadband 3G and 4G networks beginning in 2010. We expect to commercially launch our fourth ATG network – Gogo 5G – in the fourth quarter of 2023. We also continue to provide narrowband satellite services to customers in North America and internationally through distribution agreements with satellite providers. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 6,900 ATG business aircraft online of which approximately 3,300 were equipped with our AVANCE platform and approximately 3,600 with Gogo Biz, our legacy ATG broadband system. The business aviation in-flight connectivity market is evolving again due to advancements in technology and several change catalysts. The most significant advancement in technology driving change in our industry today is the introduction of low earth orbit (“LEO”) satellite technology, which provides, among other things, a global service offering and significantly higher capacity and lower latency than alternatives available today. We believe that demand for in-flight connectivity will continue to increase because of changes in the demographics of our customer base, the proliferation of social applications and lifestyle changes that remain in a post-COVID world such as remote work and use of videoconferencing. Further, 66% of business aircraft in North America were manufactured before IFC was available as a linefit option. We expect approximately 25% of these aircraft will be replaced in the next five to seven years with new aircraft coming pre-installed with in-flight connectivity given customer expectations today. We view all these significant changes as opportunities to leverage our technological know-how and deep understanding of the business aviation in-flight connectivity market to drive greater penetration of our solutions in our markets over the next five to ten years. As outlined below, we have refined our strategy to capture these opportunities, including an announcement in May 2022 that we are preparing to launch the first global broadband service designed for business aviation (“Global Broadband”). The service will use an electronically steered antenna (“ESA”), specifically designed with Hughes Network Systems, LLC (“Hughes”) to address a broad range of business aviation aircraft, operating on a LEO satellite network operated by Network Access Associates, Ltd. (“OneWeb”). We believe that Global Broadband, in combination with or as an alternative to our ATG systems, will allow us to increase our penetration of the North American heavy jet market and provide an upgrade path for our existing ATG customer base. In addition, Global Broadband will allow us to penetrate the business aviation market outside of North America, where fewer than 6% of business aviation aircraft are installed with in-flight connectivity systems. Now and Next Strategy Given the industry evolution described above, we have refined our strategy, ultimately creating what we refer to as the “Now and Next Strategy”. The Now and Next Strategy positions Gogo to penetrate the rest of the world business aviation market while maintaining and strengthening our leadership position in North America. The principal elements of our Now and Next Strategy include the following: 5 In executing the Now and Next Strategy, we will continue to adhere to the product development principles that have guided us historically. These include, among other things, (i) maintaining product offerings that fit the distinct needs of each segment of the business aviation market based on geography, mission, size of aircraft, and passenger preferences; (ii) building customer loyalty by providing easy and low-cost upgrade paths for our customers as their demand for capacity grows; and (iii) running all of our offerings on a single software-centric operating system via AVANCE, which allows for easy software upgrades and multiple-network access points to the aircraft allowing for easy upgrades to superior networks as technology evolves. Competitive Differentiators We believe Gogo is uniquely positioned to thrive in this dynamic industry environment, due in part to the competitive differentiators described below: Our Product Platform . Our product platform includes three components – networks, antennas, and airborne equipment and software, each of which is discussed in greater detail below. The comprehensiveness and flexibility in our product platform allows us to align our value proposition with our customers’ priorities and identify solutions based on geography, mission, size of aircraft and passenger preference. Our Distribution Relationships . We believe that our distribution network is unmatched in our industry. Our distribution partners include every OEM of business aviation aircraft and an aftermarket network of approximately 120 dealers, many of whom we have worked with for decades. We have established trusted relationships with our distribution partners and a proven track record of generating revenues and profits for them, and they have trust and confidence in our ability to continue to do so. This facilitates our sales and our speed to market as our distribution partners are willing to invest in marketing and certification efforts for our equipment. Our Innovative Culture . We continuously innovate and have a strong track record of innovation in our networks. As of February 24, 2023, we held approximately 457 U.S. and international patents, most of which relate to network technology. We pioneered and have led innovation in our industry for nearly 30 years, as evidenced by the three proprietary ATG network technologies that we have deployed for the business aviation market. We expect to commercially launch our fourth ATG network – Gogo 5G – in the fourth quarter of 2023. Products, Services, Customers and Customer Support We focus exclusively on selling in-flight connectivity to the business aviation market and implement our value proposition of offering the best products and services through a comprehensive portfolio consisting of our in-flight systems, in-flight services, aviation partner support, engineering, design and development services and production operations functions. In-Flight Systems . Our customers have a broad range of equipment choices for their in-flight systems, which allows us to provide a solution based on geography, mission, size of aircraft and passenger preference. Key components of our in-flight systems include: Antennas . Gogo has developed three families of ATG antennas, all of which act in pairs and are mounted on the belly of the aircraft. Gogo currently deploys omni-directional antennas and dual directional antennas, both of which support customers utilizing our 3G and 4G networks. In connection with the launch of Gogo 5G, Gogo will introduce the MB-13 antenna, which is capable of accessing Gogo’s 4 MHz of licensed spectrum in the 800 MHz band and unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band at the same time, enabling greater throughput than our omni-directional and dual directional antennas. In connection with the launch of Global Broadband, Gogo is working with Hughes to design an ESA that will fit on a very broad range of business aviation aircraft – from light jets and turboprops to large-cabin jets. The ESA is expected to be delivered in the second half of 2024 and will operate on OneWeb’s high speed, low latency LEO satellite network. Airborne Equipment and Software . Our networks and systems are designed to provide the best in-flight Internet experience and highest network and system availability across the broadest range of aircraft wherever they fly, and a growing number of our installed aircraft are on the AVANCE platform. The AVANCE platform is software-centric and designed to be extensible as it includes hardware built with common components that operate on a single operating system across multiple devices. Approximately 80% of the components included in AVANCE L5 and AVANCE L3 (a compact version of AVANCE L5 designed for smaller aircraft) are common across the two systems. Because of this extensibility, we can add new products, features and options; we can increase connectivity speeds by augmenting spectrum; and we can add proprietary or third-party ATG or satellite networks, all with minimal or no hardware or aircraft modifications. For example, existing AVANCE customers who wish to add Global Broadband service will only have to install an ESA on top of their aircraft and run a power cable and ethernet cable to the AVANCE box inside the aircraft. For customers operating AVANCE-equipped aircraft in North America, AVANCE’s unique multi-bearer capability will allow Gogo to combine capacity from its ATG network and the OneWeb LEO satellite network to provide more capacity than stand-alone LEO satellite networks can provide. We expect AVANCE’s common componentry to facilitate standardization of hardware and FAA certifications across multiple products, spectrum frequencies and networks, and we expect that such standardization will in turn increase efficiency and improve quality in functions that include supply chain, production operations and customer support. Of the 6 AVANCE aircraft online at December 31, 2022, approximately 2,100 were equipped with AVANCE L5 and approximately 1,200 with AVANCE L3. In-Flight Services (Service Plans) . We provide a wide range of in-flight services for passengers, flight and cabin crews and our aviation partners. We offer a variety of connectivity services tailored to our various networks and technologies that are generally priced on a per-aircraft per-month basis. We offer service plans ranging from unlimited data usage to a pay-as-you-go monthly consumption plan and offer alongside these data plans voice rates, inflight entertainment options such as Gogo Vision, and other service features. Customers and Distribution Partners . We provide in-flight connectivity services to a variety of customers needing connectivity, but our end users are primarily aircraft owners/operators. As of December 31, 2022, our market was comprised of approximately 24,700 business aircraft in North America, of which approximately 30% have broadband connectivity, and approximately 14,400 business aircraft in the rest of the world, of which fewer than 6% have broadband connectivity. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4,200 customers. Out top ten customers accounted for approximately 20% of our 2022 service revenue (excluding Intelsat), and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2022. We also sell directly to every OEM of business aviation aircraft including Bombardier, Dassault Falcon, Embraer, Gulfstream, Pilatus and Textron Aviation. In the aftermarket, we sell through a global distribution network of approximately 120 independent dealers who are certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) as Maintenance and Repair Organizations. Our independent dealers market, resell and obtain FAA-required supplemental type certificates (“STC”) for our equipment. Our customers also include fractional jet operators such as Flexjet and NetJets, charter operators such as Wheels Up, corporate flight departments and individuals owning aircraft. Infrastructure . The infrastructure supporting our in-flight connectivity services consists of our networks, towers, and data centers, each of which is described in greater detail below. Networks and Towers . We have developed, deployed and operated our own networks for more than 25 years, resulting in experience and know-how that we believe is unmatched by any other provider in our industry. We hold the exclusive license to 4MHz of U.S. nationwide spectrum dedicated to ATG use, as well as the exclusive rights to the same spectrum in Canada. We currently operate a terrestrial network using 3 MHz of licensed spectrum in the 800 MHz band and approximately 260 terrestrial cell sites in the lower 48 states and parts of Alaska and Canada. All but one of our cell sites are leased from tower operators. Our terrestrial network targets approximately 24,700 business aircraft based in North America. As of December 31, 2022, this network supported 3.1 Mbps 3G service and 9.8 Mbps 4G service. Our proprietary ATG network provides lower latency and requires less powerful antennas than the networks operated by our geosynchronous (“GEO”) satellite competitors and enables us to avoid the interference issues that can accompany use of shared, unlicensed spectrum. We expect to commercially launch our fourth ATG network – Gogo 5G – in the fourth quarter of 2023. We have announced completion of key Gogo 5G milestones including finishing construction of our initial 150 cell sites that comprise our 5G terrestrial network in the lower 48 states, obtaining a STC and Parts Manufacturing Approval (“PMA”) for the 5G airborne antenna system, qualifying the airborne line replaceable unit (“LRU”) for flight testing and signing an agreement with Jet Edge as our 5G launch partner. Customers who elect to not upgrade to Gogo 5G may continue to use our 3G and 4G service over our ATG networks in North America. The 3G and 4G service will also serve as a redundancy network and performance enhancement mechanism for Gogo 5G. In addition, in May 2022 we announced that we have partnered with OneWeb to utilize their global LEO satellite network. They plan to complete launch of their network in April of 2023 and be ready to start offering aero service in 2024. In addition to the significant performance enhancements provided by the LEO network, Global Broadband expands our total addressable market by approximately 14,400 aircraft in the rest of the world. Ground Network and Data Centers . We lease an extensive, predominantly fiber-optic network to connect our approximately 260 cell sites to our two data centers, the Internet and cloud-based services, and our network operations center (“NOC”). Our data centers and cloud-based services provide redundant telecommunications connections to the Internet and contain numerous servers that enable the expansive set of features that we offer. The NOC monitors daily network operations, conducts network diagnostics and coordinates responses to any performance issues. We augment our ability to monitor, maintain and update our in-flight systems while aircraft are on the ground with a terrestrial modem utilizing 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi wireless service. Support Organizations . We strive to deliver a premium customer experience. We accomplish this through the support of the following functions. Customer Support . We have created a support and service organization designed to provide operational assistance and comprehensive analytics to our customers. Our customer support organization is grouped into three subfunctions that include account teams, operational support, and comprehensive analytics. These teams assist with, among other things, installations, troubleshooting and system activations, and data analysis to evaluate our system and operational performance. We have specialized support for our OEM distribution partners and dealers who are responsible for obtaining the FAA certifications required for installation of our equipment on aircraft, and we support them in obtaining such certifications and installing the equipment through our aircraft 7 application engineers. We also deploy our field service engineering teams in key locations across the United States and Europe to support our customers’ flight departments following installation of our equipment. Both the dealer network and customer flight departments have access to our technical and logistical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Engineering, Design and Development (“ED&D”) . Our large in-house ED&D operation is responsible for translating business requirements into products that comply with rigorous avionics certification requirements. Its capabilities include: (i) a radiofrequency engineering team with expertise in antenna specifications, radio technology, spectrum analysis, network design and regulatory requirements; (ii) an airborne platform development team which manages the design, development and testing of airborne equipment and its integration with ground systems and leads FAA certification efforts; (iii) a systems engineering team that manages all aspects of turning business requirements into technical specifications and is responsible for our program management process; (iv) an application development and business systems organization team that manages development of our internal business systems and the product extensions that sit on the AVANCE platform; and (v) a network engineering team that designs, implements and manages our network and data center infrastructure, security and core network functions. Production Operations. Our manufacturing objective is to produce superior quality products that conform to avionics specifications while providing the best value to our customers. Given our highly specialized technology and required production levels, we design, assemble and test our airborne LRUs in-house, while relying on third parties to manufacture specific components based on our design specifications to maximize production efficiencies. We retain the intellectual property associated with the airborne LRUs. We also rely on third parties to manufacture our antennas and we generally share antenna design responsibilities and intellectual property with these vendors. Our manufacturing processes include internally designed test fixtures and software that we and our third-party manufacturers employ at all levels of manufacturing. Our manufacturing-related business processes – from sales forecasts to supply chain activities to shipping – are integrated and automated within our enterprise resource planning tools. Our manufacturing and repair facilities are FAA-certified. Competition We compete against both equipment-providers and GEO- and LEO- satellite based telecommunications service providers, as well as resellers of the above, to the business aviation market, including Honeywell Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Satcom Direct, Inmarsat, ViaSat and Starlink. In addition, SmartSky Networks, which in 2014 announced that it planned to launch an ATG network in the continental United States in 2016, announced in late 2022 that the network is “live nationwide.” A number of our competitors are focused on servicing the heavy jet market through GEO satellite services. We may in the future face competition from other operators of LEO or other non-GEO satellite networks. We believe that the principal points of competition in our market are technological capabilities, price, geographic coverage, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, regulatory compliance, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Licenses and Regulation Federal Aviation Administration The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. The dealers and OEMs to which we sell our equipment are generally responsible for obtaining STCs for each aircraft type on which our equipment will be installed, and we support them in those efforts. Separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different owners and operators. After an STC is obtained, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facility’s production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements. Certain of our FCC licenses are conditioned upon our ability to obtain from the FAA a “No Hazard Determination” for our cell sites, which indicates that a proposed structure will not, if built as specified, create a hazard to air navigation. When building or altering certain cell sites, we may first be required to obtain such a determination. Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified engineering and other professionals. 8 In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures and quality control systems continue to meet FAA requirements. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities or on aircraft. Foreign Aviation Regulation According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the airworthiness of U.S.-registered and FAA type-certificated aircraft on which FAA-certified Gogo equipment is installed is recognized by civil aviation authorities (“CAAs”) worldwide that are signatories to that Convention. As a result, Gogo does not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering Gogo equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA of a country other than the United States, the installation of Gogo equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority. The FAA holds bilateral agreements with certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement (“BAA”) or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (“BASA”) with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart CAA. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircraft’s country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a Validation Supplemental Type Certificate. For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, Gogo must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification, Gogo will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each aircraft operator’s service in any country in which it registers aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on such aircraft. U.S. Department of Transportation The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) established an Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transportation to negotiate and develop a proposed rule concerning accommodations for passengers with disabilities in three basic areas, including in-flight entertainment (“IFE”) and closed captioning of IFE. The Committee issued a resolution in late 2016 that included its recommendations to the DOT for a rule on IFE. However, since a final rule on IFE has not yet been issued, it is unclear how, if at all, it may impact Gogo. According to the Agency Rule List – Spring 2022 posted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, the rulemaking about accessible IFE is a long-term action. Federal Communications Commission Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), the FCC licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless services. The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCC’s prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of Gogo by non-U.S. individuals or entities. Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. For example, we provide some of our voice and data services (not including Gogo Biz or AVANCE) by reselling the telecommunications services of two satellite operators. Because we provide these services on a common carrier basis, we are subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. In addition, we provide an interconnected voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) service. The FCC applies many, but not all, of the same regulatory requirements to interconnected VoIP services as it does to common carrier telecommunications services. We offer connectivity service in the United States to business aviation aircraft and, pursuant to the ATG Network Sharing Agreement, to certain commercial aircraft operated by Intelsat’s airline customers, through our own facilities, using our ATG License, a nationwide commercial air-ground radiotelephone license in the 800 MHz band. We obtained and paid for this spectrum through an auction conducted by the FCC. See “ATG License Terms and Conditions.” The FCC’s current rules classify broadband Internet access service as a lightly regulated, non-common carrier “information service,” and remove virtually all of the previously imposed network neutrality restrictions on blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of broadband providers’ affiliates. We remain subject to certain modified transparency obligations that require disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms. To the extent the FCC 9 further restricts reasonable network management, or to the extent network neutrality proponents prevail on the adoption of further network neutrality restrictions, our business may be affected. Our Internet access service is also subject to the FCC’s data roaming rules, which require commercial mobile data service (“CMDS”) providers like Gogo to negotiate roaming arrangements with any requesting facilities-based, technologically compatible providers of CMDS. The rules do not give other providers the right to install equipment on Gogo-equipped aircraft and do not require the Gogo service to be provided on a discounted basis, although the arrangement must be “commercially reasonable.” The rules allow us to take reasonable measures to safeguard the quality of our service against network congestion that may result from roaming traffic. In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible to persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content offered through our Gogo Vision. In addition to the two ATG licenses, we hold microwave licenses that are used for backhaul in our terrestrial network and an authorization for the provision of voice and data services between the United States and foreign points. ATG License Terms and Conditions The FCC issued our ATG License on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term. We have satisfied our obligation under the license to provide “substantial service” to aircraft, and on January 25, 2017, we received confirmation from the FCC that the license has been renewed until October 31, 2026. Our 1 MHz ATG license obtained in 2013 from LiveTV Airfone, LLC was also originally issued on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term, although there is no “substantial service” obligation that attaches to this license. Our application to renew our license was subsequently granted for an additional 10-year term. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order that, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is not currently clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. Our two ATG licenses contain certain conditions that require us to comply with all applicable FCC and FAA rules as well as all bilateral agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico regarding the frequencies that are allocated for ATG services. These agreements apply to our use of the spectrum in areas adjacent to the United States’ northern and southern borders and in and out of Canadian and Mexican airspace. A bilateral ATG spectrum coordination agreement between the U.S. and Canada has been negotiated and approved and a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico is pending. In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary a subordinate license that allows us to use Canadian ATG spectrum of which SkySurf Communications Inc. is the primary licensee, and in 2019 the primary license was renewed for an eight-year term expiring June 29, 2027. In 2012, we entered into a license agreement with SkySurf (the “License Agreement”), which commenced on August 14, 2012 and was recently renewed for a second ten-year term expiring July 24, 2032. Provided that the primary spectrum license agreement issued by Industry Canada (now Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada or “ISED”) to SkySurf remains in effect on July 24, 2032, the License Agreement is renewable at our option for a further five-year term. The term of the License Agreement, including the second 10-year term and any renewals, is contingent on the effectiveness of the primary spectrum license. Any future coordination agreement with Mexico and/or a Mexican ATG licensee could affect our ability to provide our broadband Internet service in the border areas using our current cell sites at current operating power levels and could affect our ability to establish or maintain ATG service in the border areas as aircraft fly into and out of Mexican airspace. Equipment Certification We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of our services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCC’s technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained. Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations We collect personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our services, along with certain identifiers associated with devices using our services. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties or create records that may be personal information in connection with our services. We use the information that we collect and create to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection, protection, disclosure and use of such information are required in some circumstances to comply with our privacy policies, applicable law, and our contractual obligations to aviation partners and other third parties, as well as industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. 10 Notwithstanding that broadband Internet access is currently classified as a Title I information service, we must continue to comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”). The FCC is currently considering additional CPNI and cybersecurity requirements, which may subject the Company to additional compliance obligations. We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Act prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” Although the FTC’s authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by communications common carriers has not been fully delineated, the FTC may have jurisdiction over some or all of our services. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that among other things: (1) collect, use, share or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the company’s actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information. We may also be subject to state laws pertaining to privacy and data security, such as the “mini-FTC Acts,” which prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state. Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect January 1, 2020 and provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA also imposes compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The California Office of the Attorney General has published final regulations to implement portions of the CCPA. In addition, in November 2020 California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA. The CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023, and new regulations are expected to take effect in 2023. Other states have enacted privacy laws: the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) went into effect on January 1, 2023, the Colorado Privacy Act and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act will take effect on July 1, 2023 and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act will take effect on December 31, 2023. These laws provide broad new privacy rights for consumers in these states, including the right to opt out of targeted advertising and certain profiling activities. Regulations relating to the Colorado Privacy Act are expected to be finalized in the course of 2023. Depending on these developments, the measures we are required to take to comply with these laws may be significant. Congress and other state legislatures have also been considering additional legislation relating to privacy and data breaches. Should any additional laws be enacted, they could affect our business. To the extent we collect personal information of residents of other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of the European Union (“EU”) took effect, and it has imposed more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the EU that process personal information about European data subjects. EU member states also have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for certain data processing activities. Additionally, in Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 (“PIPEDA”) and substantially similar provincial laws may impose data privacy and security obligations on the processing of personal data. The regulation of data privacy and security in other jurisdictions continues to evolve. In addition, certain countries have laws that restrict the transfer of personal information outside of such countries. For example, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the member states of the EU impose restrictions on transferring such data to countries, including the U.S., that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. Certain mechanisms apply under Swiss, United Kingdom and EU member state laws that permit the cross-border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Additionally, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (the highest EU court) ruled the EU-US privacy shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues regarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. On September 27, 2021, new versions of the SCC went into effect. Depending on the supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers and implement the SCC, our ability to lawfully transfer personally identifiable information out of relevant jurisdictions to the United States or other jurisdictions may be impacted. 11 Other countries, such as Australia, Brazil, China, India and Russia have also implemented, amended or been considering legislation regarding data protection, data security, breach notification and data transfers/localization. Such laws may affect our business and, should any additional laws be enacted in countries in which we do business, those laws may also affect our business. Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection The FCC’s Truth in Billing rules require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our satellite-based services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers’ billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on ATG services. CALEA The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, which include Gogo, are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered service providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures. We have implemented such policies and procedures and, based upon our periodic self-assessments, we believe that our network is compliant with CALEA. FCC Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program (the “FCC Reimbursement Program”) ​ On July 15, 2022, the Company was notified that it was approved for participation in the FCC Reimbursement Program, designed to reimburse providers of advanced communications services for reasonable costs incurred in the required removal, replacement, and disposal of covered communications equipment or services, that have been deemed to pose a national security risk, from their networks. Pursuant to the FCC Reimbursement Program, the FCC approved up to approximately $333 million in reimbursements to the Company to cover documented and approved costs to (i) remove and securely destroy all ZTE communications equipment and services in the Company’s terrestrial U.S. networks and replace such equipment and (ii) remove and replace certain equipment installed on aircraft operated by the Company’s ATG customers that is not compatible with the terrestrial equipment that will replace ZTE equipment. Due to a shortfall in the amount appropriated by Congress to fund the FCC Reimbursement Program, approximately $131 million of the approved amount is currently allocated to the Company under the program. If Congress appropriates additional funds for this purpose, the allocations of the Company and other approved applicants will be increased pro rata . Program participants are subject to a number of conditions and requirements under the FCC’s rules including a requirement that they submit their first reimbursement request by July 14, 2023 and certify that they have developed a plan to permanently remove, replace and dispose of covered equipment or services within one year following the first reimbursement request. The rules permit participants to petition the FCC for one or more six-month extensions of the completion deadline. The Company has not yet determined whether it will participate in the FCC Reimbursement Program. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us. We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States and certain countries outside of the United States. As of February 24, 2023, we held U.S. patents expiring on dates ranging from June 2023 to January 2041 and foreign patents expiring on dates ranging from November 2024 to August 2039. We do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective. We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the United States and certain other countries include, among others, “Gogo,” “Gogo Biz” and “Gogo Vision,” although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We license or purchase from third parties technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors. We also license our proprietary technology and software to third parties to enable them to integrate such technology and software into the products they provide to us. Many of our agreements with such third parties are renewable for indefinite periods of time unless either party chooses to terminate, although some of our agreements expire after fixed periods and require renegotiation prior to expiration in order to extend the term. Among the most material of our technology-related agreements are those for modems, base stations and antennas. Our agreements for modems, base stations and antennas do not renew automatically 12 and thus require periodic renegotiation. Such agreements, as well as certain licenses to commercially available software, are material to our business. Under the terms of the Transaction, we retained ownership of the entire patent portfolio held by Gogo Inc. and its affiliates, including patents developed and obtained in connection with our former commercial aviation business. We have granted Intelsat a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license to our patent portfolio for use in the commercial aviation and satellite mobility businesses (each as defined in the license agreement). We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and vendors. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained. Human Capital We believe that our success is the product of an integrated approach to talent management that touches every part of our business. Rather than focusing on individual processes, we manage our employee ecosystem holistically by encouraging behaviors, conversations, relationships and activities that represent best practices for a high performing culture. We are committed to fostering a highly engaged workforce and in turn driving satisfaction among partners and customers through initiatives that include the following: As of December 31, 2022, women and employees identifying with minority races comprised approximately 28.2% and 30.8%, respectively, of our workforce. We have nine members on our Board of Directors of which one is Black and a 13 woman. Of the five members on our Executive Leadership Team, two are women and another is Hispanic/Latinx. While Gogo promotes inclusiveness for all, we are focusing our recruiting efforts on expanding the diversity in our candidate pipeline overall, specifically including a greater focus on hiring more women and individuals who are Black. The efforts outlined above are supported by our dedicated human resources team and led by our Executive Vice President, Chief People Experience Officer, who is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy and regularly updates our Board of Directors and senior management on the operation and status of our human capital activities. As of December 31, 2022, we had 422 employees. No employee is a member of a labor union. Corporate Information Gogo Inc. is a holding company that does business through its subsidiaries.

Risk Factors You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below. Risks Related to Our Business We may be unable to continue to generate revenue from the provision of our connectivity services, which could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability. Our business is dependent on our ability to continuously attract and retain users of our connectivity and other service offerings, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts or that customer retention levels will not materially decline. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Gogo service we provided on business aircraft (which excludes service provided on commercial aircraft under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement) generated approximately 71%, 75% and 78% of our revenue from continuing operations, respectively. A significant portion of such service revenue is generated through individual subscription agreements with our customers that cover a single or small number of aircraft, with the remainder generated through subscription agreements with certain fractional or charter operators covering larger fleets of aircraft. These agreements are generally no more than one-year in duration. As such, we have no assurance that any of such customers will renew their existing agreements with us upon expiration on comparable terms or at all, including as a result of a lack of demand or dissatisfaction with our services or the availability of superior or less expensive alternatives in the market. In addition, our subscription agreements are generally terminable at will by our customers and, if terminated, we may not be able to collect amounts we would have otherwise expected to receive during the full term of the agreement. To the extent that our subscribers terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us for any reason, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our subscription agreements do not generally contain minimum commitments for the usage of our connectivity and other services. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of reduced usage of our services by our customers or allow customers to suspend their accounts, which could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability. For example, we experienced a sharp decrease in flight activity, an increase in account suspensions and a decrease in new plan activities in mid-2020 as a result of reduced travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are reliant on our key OEMs and dealers for equipment sales. Revenue from equipment sales accounted for approximately 27%, 23% and 21% of our revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. More than 90% of our equipment revenue in each such fiscal year was generated from contracts with OEMs and after-market dealers. Almost all of our contracts with OEMs and dealers are terminable at will by either party on short notice. If one or more key OEMs or dealers terminates its relationship with us for any reason or our contract expires and is not renewed, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, pursuant to many of our contracts with our OEM distribution partners, we have agreed to deliver equipment and/or services, including equipment and services not yet in production, for a fixed price and, accordingly, take the risk of any cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Certain of our contracts with our OEMs also include provisions that, under specified circumstances, entitle them to the benefit of certain more favorable provisions in other equipment contracts, including with respect to pricing. These provisions, some of which have retroactive effect, may limit the benefits we realize from contracts containing such provisions. Our inability to identify and offer improved terms to a distribution partner or customer in accordance with such a provision could negatively affect our relationship with that distribution partner or customer or give rise to a claim that we are in breach of such contract. Many of our distribution partners have also not committed to purchase any minimum quantity of our equipment. In certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon non-binding production schedules provided by OEMs, historical purchasing patterns and informal discussions with customers and dealers as to their anticipated future requirements. Cancellations, reductions or delays by OEMs and dealers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of our dealers are experiencing continuing issues with labor shortages, which has impacted their ability to install our equipment, leading to a longer period of time between shipment and activation of our equipment. If our dealers are unable to eliminate or mitigate these labor shortages, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 15 Our distribution partners may be materially adversely impacted by economic downturns and market disruptions. See “— Adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdowns, may have a material adverse effect on our business .” In anticipation of changing economic conditions, OEMs in particular may be more conservative in their production, which may reduce our market opportunities. Further, unfavorable market conditions could cause one or more of our OEMs or dealers to file for bankruptcy, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and could harm our results of operations. Our equipment and services are sold in competitive markets. Some of our current or potential future competitors are, or could potentially be, larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand pricing pressures and the effects of periodic economic downturns. Some of our current or future competitors may offer a broader product line or broader geographic coverage to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if our competitors: We believe that the principal points of competition in our business are technological capabilities, geographic coverage, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, compliance with regulatory certification requirements, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. SmartSky recently announced that its ATG network in the continental United States, originally targeted for launch in 2016, is now “live nationwide.” This is the first time that we have faced competition from a nationwide ATG network, and should such competitor be successful in entering our market, other competitors could be prompted to enter this business using the same or other ATG spectrum. Another in-flight connectivity provider has launched service on commercial aircraft in Europe using a hybrid ATG/satellite network. While we have recently announced our plans to launch our LEO-satellite based Global Broadband service, we do not currently offer satellite-based broadband service and could face competition from owners of LEO and other new non-GEO satellite constellations should they decide to enter our market. Starlink, a division of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. that operates a LEO satellite network, has been awarded an ESIM (Earth Stations in Motion) license by the FCC that would cover aircraft and other moving vehicles. In October 2022, Starlink announced that it is taking orders for its planned global in-flight connectivity service, with equipment deliveries expected to begin in 2023. A failure to successfully anticipate and respond to Starlink and other established and new competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. We depend upon third parties, many of which are single-source providers, to manufacture equipment components, provide services for our network and install and maintain our equipment. We rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components and services that we use to provide our services. Many suppliers of critical components of our equipment are single-source providers. Components for which we rely on single-source suppliers include, among others, the antennas and modems for all systems, the equipment used at our ATG cell site base stations and the ESA for our Global Broadband network. We plan to launch Global Broadband using OneWeb as our sole LEO satellite network provider. If we are required for any reason (including expiration of the contract, termination by one party for material breach or other termination events) to find one or more alternative suppliers, we estimate that the replacement process could take up to two years depending upon the component or service, and we may not be able to contract with such alternative suppliers on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Finding and contracting with suppliers of some components may be delayed or made more difficult by current suppliers’ ownership of key intellectual property that requires alternative suppliers to either obtain rights to such intellectual property or develop new designs that do not infringe on such intellectual property. In addition, many of our components, such as the equipment used in our base stations, are highly integrated with other system components, which may further lengthen the time required for an alternative supplier to deliver a component or service that meets our system requirements. We also rely on third parties to provide the links between our data centers and our ground network. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our inventory needs and production schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 16 The supply of third-party components and services could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers or a significant decline in their financial condition. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Global supply chain challenges and logistics issues as well as increasing inflation have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In early 2020, many manufacturers of electronic components reduced their capacity in response to the reduced demand that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. While manufacturers have begun to increase manufacturing capacity as demand recovers from the impact of COVID-19, demand has exceeded supply in certain areas, and global shortages of electronic components have occurred. In addition, inflation, changes in trade policies, the imposition of duties and tariffs, potential retaliatory countermeasures, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and geopolitical conflicts continue to adversely impact the availability and price of electronic components. We have experienced longer lead times and encountered delays in obtaining electronic components, and we expect longer lead times and delays to continue. While we believe that we have adequate inventory or will be able to acquire sufficient electronic components to meet customer demand as currently forecasted, increases in demand combined with a continued shortage of electronic components could cause product delays or shortages. We have prepaid the suppliers of certain components to help ensure adequate supply and expect to continue to do so, and we may face price increases for certain components due to the shortages. In addition, the effects of the pandemic include global logistics issues such as shipping logjams, workforce shortages and carrier capacity constraints, all of which may negatively affect our ability to obtain electronic and other components on a timely basis. We cannot predict how long the component shortages or logistics issues will continue. When we expand our business outside the United States with Global Broadband, we will be exposed to a variety of risks associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business. Although our operations and business are currently predominately located in the United States, a component of our growth strategy involves the launch and expansion of our Global Broadband operations and customer base internationally. As we expand internationally, we expect that we would be subject to additional risks related to conducting operations outside the United States, including, but not limited to: 17 These and other factors could affect our ability to compete successfully and expand internationally and, consequently, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute our growth strategy. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business. Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries such as ours is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our ATG networks and related technology and develop and successfully deploy Gogo 5G, Global Broadband and other elements of our technology roadmap and new wireless telecommunications products and technology. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees may have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel, including Oakleigh Thorne, our CEO. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Gogo and its operations. As a result, if any of our key personnel were to leave Gogo, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key employees. In addition, much of our key technology and systems is custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, could disrupt our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Pandemics or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures implemented to combat them have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. We face various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics and other outbreak of infectious disease. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decline in international and domestic business aviation travel, which materially and adversely affected our business in 2020. Future pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases could result in similar or worse impacts and significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and limitations on the availability of workforces. Whether and to what extent future pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases may impact our financial and operational performance will depend on developments that include the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the timetable for administering and efficacy of vaccines, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of the pandemic or outbreak on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, and other factors beyond our control, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition to directly impacting demand for air travel, COVID-19 has had, and future pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases and any resultant restrictions may have, a material and adverse impact on other aspects of our business, including: 18 In addition, pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases may also exacerbate other risks disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For example, COVID-19 has had, and future pandemics and other outbreaks of contagious diseases may have, an adverse effect on our supply chain. See “— Global supply chain challenges and logistics issues as well as increasing inflation have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations .” Adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdowns, may have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the nature, extent, timing or likelihood of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of any economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States or in the aviation industry. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and globally, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, declines in consumer confidence, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, and financial and credit market fluctuations could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on air travel and otherwise, and could materially and adversely affect the growth of our business. In particular, although inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years, the U.S. economy has recently experienced a significant inflationary effect from, among other things, supply chain disruptions and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation, there is currently significant uncertainty in the near-term economic outlook. Continued inflation would further raise our costs for labor, materials and services, which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. Additionally, we may be unable to raise our prices for our equipment and services in amounts equal to the rate of inflation, and if our constrained supply chain continues, our operating profit and balance sheet may be negatively impacted. In addition, geopolitical risks, including those arising from political turmoil, trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, terrorist activity and acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. For instance, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had negative impacts on the global economy, including by contributing to rapidly rising costs of living (driven largely by higher energy prices) in Europe and created uncertainty in the global capital markets and is expected to have further global economic consequences, including disruptions of energy markets. Further, other events outside of our control, including natural disasters, climate change-related events and regional or global outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may materially and adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as our business and results of operations. If conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, it could lead to a decrease in air travel, cause owners and operators of business aircraft to cut costs by reducing their purchases or use of private aircraft or their use of in-flight Internet access on such aircraft or reduce the number of airline passengers on commercial aircraft to which we supply ATG network access. Should an economic slowdown occur in the U.S. or globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may not be able to fully utilize portions of our deferred tax assets, which would negatively impact our earnings and other comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our determination that we are more likely than not to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets resulted in a release of approximately $11.4 million of our valuation allowance. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates—Deferred Income Taxes - Valuation Allowance,” our determination that we are more likely than not to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets represents our best estimate and considers both positive and negative factors. We considered positive factors including the sale of our CA business, the reduction in interest expense resulting from the Refinancing and the settlement of the 2022 Convertible Notes, strong demand for our products and services and pre-tax income from continuing operations in 2022 and the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2021. The negative factors included cumulative pre-tax losses from continuing operations in the three-year period ending with the current quarter and our relatively short history of pre-tax income from continuing operations. It is possible that there will be changes in our business, our performance, our industry or otherwise that cause actual results to differ materially from this estimate. If those changes result in significant and sustained reductions in our pre-tax income or utilization of existing tax carryforwards in future periods, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded, which could have a material adverse impact on earnings and/or other comprehensive income. Increased attention to climate change, ESG matters and conservation measures may adversely impact our business. Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. See “ — Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation — We may be affected by global climate change or by legal and regulatory responses to such change. ” Increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our 19 reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Environmental activists and organizations have recently promoted the idea of “flight shaming,” or advocating that consumers reduce their use of private jets and commercial air travel in favor of more environmentally sustainable modes of transportation such as boats, trains and buses. To the extent that our customers reduce their use of air travel in response to new environmental regulation or changes in public perception about the impact of air travel on climate change, our customers may reduce their usage of our services and, as a result, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, other stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, employees, regulators and suppliers, have also been focused on ESG matters. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or that are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern regarding ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and other adverse consequences. We may be unsuccessful at evaluating or pursuing strategic opportunities, which could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operation. Our Board and management continuously assess whether shareholder value would be increased by engaging in strategic and/or financial relationships, transactions or other opportunities, including those that are suggested to us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we will pursue any strategic or financial relationship, transaction or other opportunity, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Further, the process of evaluating and pursuing any such relationship, transaction or other opportunity will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks relating to assessing and undertaking strategic opportunities, it may disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, financial condition and results of operation. Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property We may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying Gogo 5G or other next generation technologies. We are currently developing a next generation ATG network using 5G technology and unlicensed spectrum, which we intend to launch on a commercial, nationwide basis in the fourth quarter of 2023. Gogo 5G will be capable of working with different spectrum and supporting different next generation technologies. There can be no assurance that we will launch Gogo 5G or any other next generation technology in sufficient time to meet growing user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience and to effectively compete in the business aviation market, due to, among other things, risks associated with: (i) our failure to design and develop a technology that provides the features and performance we require; (ii) integrating the solution with our existing ATG network; (iii) the availability of adequate spectrum; (iv) the failure of spectrum to perform as expected; (v) the failure of equipment and software to perform as expected; (vi) problems arising in the manufacturing process; (vii) our ability to negotiate contracts with suppliers on acceptable commercial and other terms; (viii) our reliance on single-source suppliers for the development and manufacturing of the core elements of the network and on other suppliers to provide certain components and services; and (ix) delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. As disclosed above under the caption “ — Risks Related to Our Business — Global supply chain challenges and logistics issues as well as increasing inflation have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations ,” we have experienced longer lead times and encountered delays in obtaining certain electronic components used in our business. For instance, manufacturing issues with respect to the 5G chip necessitated process revisions and additional testing, which repeatedly delayed the delivery date for this component, and the supplier of the chip informed us in August 2022 of late-stage testing issues which will further delay delivery. We currently believe that this combination of delays will likely shift the launch of Gogo 5G service into the fourth quarter of 2023. If Gogo 5G or any other next generation technology fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines we establish, our ability to meet users' expectations regarding our systems' performance and to effectively compete in our market may be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying our Global Broadband service. In May 2022, we announced our plans to launch Global Broadband using an ESA designed with Hughes and utilized on a LEO satellite network operated by OneWeb. There can be no assurance that we will launch Global Broadband in sufficient time to effectively compete in the global business aviation market, if at all, due to, among other things, risks associated with: (i) OneWeb’s failure to launch or delay in launching its LEO satellite network; (ii) the failure of our equipment and software to perform as expected; (iii) the failure of the OneWeb network to perform as expected; (iv) integrating our hardware and software with the OneWeb network; (v) problems arising in the manufacturing process; (vi) our ability to negotiate contracts with suppliers on acceptable commercial and other terms; (vii) our reliance on single-source suppliers for the development and manufacturing of the antenna and access to a LEO network; and (viii) delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. As disclosed above under the caption “ — Risks Related to Our Business — Global supply chain challenges and logistics issues as well as increasing inflation have had, and may continue to have, an adverse 20 effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations ,” we have experienced longer lead times and encountered delays in obtaining certain electronic components used in our business, and such issues could affect the development of Global Broadband. If Global Broadband fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines we establish, our ability to meet customers’ or end users’ expectations regarding our systems’ performance and to effectively compete in our market may be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. See “ Risks Related to Our Business — Competition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and could harm our results of operations .” Furthermore, under our agreement with Hughes we have committed to purchase, over a seven-year period, antennas with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $170 million, and we may make additional financial commitments in connection with Global Broadband. If we are not successful in launching Global Broadband, we may nonetheless, depending on the circumstances, be required to honor these commitments. Our business is dependent on the availability of spectrum. In June 2006, we purchased at FCC auction an exclusive ten-year, 3 MHz license for ATG spectrum, and in April 2013, as part of our acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC, we acquired an additional 1MHz ATG spectrum license. In 2017, our applications to renew our licenses were granted for additional ten-year terms without further payment. Any breach of the terms of our FCC licenses, FCC waiver conditions or FCC regulations including foreign ownership restrictions, permitted uses of the spectrum and compliance with FAA regulations could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of our licenses or a refusal by the FCC to renew the licenses upon expiration. Further, in connection with an application to renew our licenses upon expiration, a competitor could file a petition opposing such renewal on anti-competitive or other grounds. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order that, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is currently not clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. While we do not currently use this license, changes in technology may enable its use in our network in the future. An ambiguous renewal requirement could impair our flexibility to use or otherwise realize the value of such spectrum beyond 2026. Our ability to offer in-flight broadband Internet access through our ATG service currently depends on our ability to maintain rights to use the 3 MHz ATG spectrum in the U.S., and our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to meet increasing performance demands and expand our service offerings in the United States will depend in part upon our ability to successfully roll-out our plans to employ unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band for concurrent use with the licensed 3 MHz spectrum to launch Gogo 5G, and may require that we obtain additional licensed or unlicensed spectrum suitable for our use. Such spectrum may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain adequate spectrum could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional ATG spectrum, whether licensed or unlicensed, is or may become available in the future. While we have exclusive rights to the only broadband spectrum licensed by the FCC for ATG use, the FCC may in the future decide to auction additional spectrum for ATG use that is not currently designated for that purpose, or a competitor could develop technology or a business plan that allows it to cost effectively use spectrum not specifically reserved for ATG, but on which ATG use is not prohibited, to provide broadband connectivity. The availability of additional spectrum in the marketplace that is available for ATG use may increase the possibility that we may face competition from one or more other ATG service providers in the future. For example, a prospective competitor has announced that its ATG network in the continental U.S. is available on a nationwide basis. Such network uses the same unlicensed spectrum that we intend to aggregate with our licensed spectrum for use in our Gogo 5G network. We could be adversely affected if we or our third party suppliers or service providers suffer service interruptions or delays, technology failures, damage to equipment or system disruptions or failures arising from, among other things, force majeure events, cyber-attacks or other malicious activities. We rely heavily on communications, information systems (both internal and provided by third parties), and the internet to conduct our business. Our brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depend upon the reliable performance of our ground network and in-flight systems. We have experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, and we may in the future experience service interruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures, which may be due to factors beyond our control. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation, brand and customer retention could be harmed, and such failures could be material breaches of our customer contracts resulting in termination rights, penalties or claims for damages. Our operations and services depend upon the extent to which our and our suppliers’ equipment is protected against damage or interruption from fire, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events. We and our vendors, like other commercial entities, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to a 21 variety of forms of cyberattacks with the objective of gaining unauthorized access to our systems and data or disrupting our operations. These include, but are not limited to, cyberattacks, phishing attacks, account takeover attempts, the introduction of computer viruses or malicious code (commonly referred to as “malware”), ransomware or other extortion tactics, denial of service attacks, credential stuffing, and other computer-related penetrations. Hardware, software or applications developed by us or received from third parties may contain exploitable vulnerabilities, bugs, or defects in design, maintenance or manufacture or other issues that could compromise information and cybersecurity. The risk of cyberattacks has also increased and will continue to increase in connection with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In light of the Ukraine war and other geopolitical events and dynamics, including ongoing tensions with North Korea, Iran and other states, state-sponsored parties or their supporters may launch retaliatory cyberattacks, and may attempt to cause supply chain disruptions, or carry out other geopolitically motivated retaliatory actions that may adversely disrupt or degrade our operations and may result in data compromise. These security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources/malicious actors, including, but not limited to, persons who constitute an insider threat, who are involved with organized crime, or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients through social engineering, phishing, mobile phone malware, and other methods. There is no assurance that administrative, physical, and technical controls and other preventive actions taken to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and protect our information technology will prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyberattacks or other security breaches to such computer systems. In some cases, such physical and electronic break-ins, cyberattacks or other security breaches may not be immediately detected. If we or our vendors fail to prevent, detect, address and mitigate such incidents, this may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A disaster such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, ransomware, computer virus, or other type of malware, terrorist attack, cyberattack or war, unanticipated problems with our or our vendors’ disaster recovery systems (and the disaster recovery systems of such vendors’ suppliers, vendors or subcontractors), could cause our computer systems to be inaccessible to our employees, distributors, vendors or customers or destroy valuable data. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our or our vendors’ managers were unavailable following a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. These interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers’ ability to provide goods and services and our employees’ ability to perform their job responsibilities. In addition, our flexible, hybrid work model, which allows our employees the option to work fully remote, could increase our operational risk, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity risks, and could impair our ability to manage our business. Unanticipated problems with, or failures of, our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans could have a material impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition. The failure of our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans could adversely impact our profitability and our business. Regulators’ or others’ scrutiny of cybersecurity, including new laws or regulations, could increase our compliance costs and operational burdens, especially as regulatory and legislative focus on cybersecurity matters intensifies. Regulators, customers, or others may act against us for any cybersecurity failures. Our continuous technological evaluations and enhancements, including changes designed to update our protective measures, may increase our risk of a breach or gap in our security. We may incur higher costs to comply with laws related to, or regulators’ scrutiny of, our use, collection, management, or transfer of data and other privacy practices. There can be no assurance that our continuous evaluation and enhancement of our cybersecurity and information security systems will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cyberattacks. Assertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. We are currently facing, and may in the future face, claims that we or a supplier have violated patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Many companies, including our competitors, are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could potentially cover many aspects of our business. While we have reviewed the patent portfolios of certain competitors and other third parties, we have not exhaustively searched all patents relevant to our technologies and business and therefore it is possible that we may be unknowingly infringing the patents of others. Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious and whether or not they result in litigation, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our merchandizing or marketing and advertising activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. In February 2022, a competitor filed a patent infringement suit against us and also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which, if granted, would have prevented us from proceeding with Gogo 5G until the infringement suit is resolved. The court denied the competitor’s motion for preliminary injunction but the competitor is appealing the denial. Adverse results in the appeal, the underlying infringement suit or other infringement suits could require us to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our sales, marketing and advertising activities 22 or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Even if we are successful in defending these claims, such litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources and could adversely affect our business relating to such disputed technology during its pendency. Pursuant to our contracts with certain customers, we have agreed to indemnify such customers against such claims, and our indemnification obligations generally include defending or paying for the defense of the action and paying any judgments or other costs assessed against the customer in the event of an adverse outcome. In most cases, our contracts do not cap our indemnification obligations. In addition, certain of our suppliers do not indemnify us for third-party infringement or misappropriation claims arising from our use of supplier technology, and we may be liable in the event of such claims. Our inability to meet our indemnification obligations and our customers terminating or failing to renew their contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We or our technology suppliers may be unable to continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to customers and passengers. The market for our services is characterized by evolving technology, changes in customer and passenger needs and performance expectations, and frequent new service and product introductions. Our success will depend, in part, on our and our suppliers’ ability to continue to enhance existing technology and services or develop new technology and services on a timely and cost-effective basis. If we or our suppliers fail to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, customer requirements and/or regulatory requirements, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We expect to have to invest significant capital to keep pace with innovation and changing technology, and if the amount of such investment exceeds our plans or the amount of investment permitted under the 2021 Credit Agreement (as defined below), it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. As is common in industries like ours, changing technology may result in obsolescence as we implement new technologies and products and retire old technologies and products. As we encounter such obsolescence, we need to ensure that we have a sufficient supply of parts, products and equipment compatible with our existing technology, as well as access to maintenance, repair and other critical support services, until the transition is completed. Certain suppliers may determine to stop manufacturing and supplying end-of-life parts, products and equipment, or may stop providing related services, prior to completion of our transition. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient inventory from existing suppliers we would be required to engage new suppliers who have access to the intellectual property required to manufacture and support components that meet our specifications, and we may be unable to contract with such suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We have implemented policies and procedures intended to ensure that we timely anticipate technology and product transitions and have access to sufficient inventory and services, but if such policies prove ineffective and we are unable to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business to effect a transition, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, following our retirement of end-of-life technologies and products, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand and might have to write off unusable inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought and obtained patent protection for certain of our technologies in the United States and certain other countries. Many of the trademarks that we use (including marks we have applied to register) contain words or terms having a somewhat common usage, such as “Gogo” and “Gogo Vision” and, as a result, we may have difficulty registering them in certain jurisdictions. We do not own, for example, the domain www.gogo.com and we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we do business or may do business in the future. If other companies have registered or have been using in commerce similar trademarks for services similar to ours in foreign jurisdictions, we may have difficulty in registering, or enforcing an exclusive right to use, our marks in those foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be effective, that any patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not obtain intellectual property rights to similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Furthermore, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries in which our service is or may in the future be offered may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property in these countries and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our ability to exploit our proprietary technology or our brand image may be harmed, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. 23 Our use of open-source software could limit our ability to commercialize our technology. Open-source software is software made widely and freely available to the public in human-readable source code form, usually with liberal rights to modify and improve such software. Some open-source licenses require as a condition of use that proprietary software that is combined with licensed open-source software and distributed must be released to the public in source code form and under the terms of the open-source license. Accordingly, depending on the manner in which such licenses were interpreted and applied, we could face restrictions on our ability to commercialize certain of our products and we could be required to: (i) release the source code of certain of our proprietary software to the public, including competitors, if the open-source software was linked in a manner that would require such release of our proprietary software source code; (ii) seek licenses from third parties for replacement software; and/or (iii) re-engineer our software in order to continue offering our products. Such consequences may materially adversely affect our business. The failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation, result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages, and impair our ability to sell our service. Our products contain complex systems, components and software that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology or when new software is first introduced or new versions or enhancements are released. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. In addition, such events could result in significant expenses and diversion of development and other resources, a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our products and services, loss of existing customers, terminations of, failures to renew, penalties or damage claims under aviation partner contracts, harm to our reputation and brand image and increased insurance costs. If our in-flight system has a malfunction resulting from an error or defect or a problem with installation or maintenance and such malfunction causes physical damage to an aircraft or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could expose us to substantial personal injury claims, product liability claims or costly repair obligations. The aircraft operated by our customers may be very costly to repair and the damages in any product liability claims could be material. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we indemnify some of our customers for losses due to third-party claims and in certain cases the causes of such losses may include failure of our products. Should we be required by the FAA or otherwise to cease providing the Gogo service, even on a temporary basis, as a result of a product malfunction or defect, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons, we could lose our FCC license. Under the Communications Act and applicable FCC regulations, we are effectively restricted from having more than 25% of our capital stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons, including individuals and entities organized outside the United States or controlled by non-U.S. persons. We have established procedures to ascertain the nature and extent of our foreign ownership, and we believe that the indirect ownership of our equity by foreign persons or entities is below the 25% cap. However, as a publicly traded company we may not be able to determine with certainty the exact amount of our stock that is held by foreign persons or entities at any given time. A failure to comply with applicable restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. persons could result in an order requiring divestiture of the offending ownership interests, fines, denial of license renewal and/or spectrum license revocation proceedings, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. Any breach of the terms of our ATG spectrum licenses, authorizations and waivers obtained by us from time to time, or any violation of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of a license or the imposition of fines. From time to time, the FCC may monitor or audit compliance with the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules or with our licenses, including if a third party were to bring a claim of breach or noncompliance. In addition, the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, may be amended in the future in a manner that could be adverse to us. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Business—Licenses and Regulation—Federal Aviation Administration,” FAA approvals required to operate our business include STCs and PMAs. While our distribution partners are responsible for obtaining STCs, obtaining PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. Prior to installation 24 of our equipment, any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining (including as a result of a government shutdown or funding shortages), or change in, needed FAA certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our installation commitments, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business. Following installation of our equipment, if we were to discover that our equipment or components of our equipment were not in compliance with specifications on which the STC authorizing installation was based, or if the FAA’s requirements changed, our non-compliance could result in our incurring material costs to inspect and in some circumstances modify or replace such equipment, and could in rare circumstances result in our system being turned off or installed aircraft being grounded. If we fail to comply with the FAA’s many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the FAA certifications, authorizations, or other approvals on which our manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance and alteration capabilities are based. In addition, from time to time, the FAA or comparable foreign agencies adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. The FAA could also change its policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies, which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, our compliance costs would likely increase. As a broadband Internet provider, we must comply with the CALEA, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Currently, our CALEA solution is fully deployed in our network. However, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC or law enforcement agencies for any delays in complying or failure to comply with, CALEA or similar obligations. Such enforcement actions could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders or other penalties, all of which may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, to the extent the FCC adopts additional capability requirements applicable to broadband Internet providers, its decision may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations. We are also subject to regulation by certain foreign laws and regulatory bodies, including ISED, which issued our exclusive Canadian ATG subordinate spectrum license and regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us. Adverse decisions or regulations of these U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are unable to predict the impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business. Our possession and use of personal information present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation. In the ordinary course of our business, we or our third-party providers collect, process and store sensitive data, including personal information of our employees and customers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information (and other sensitive data such as our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers) is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or may be compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, hardware or software defects or other disruptions. Further, our in-cabin network operates as an open, unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, and non-encrypted transmissions users send over this network may be vulnerable to access by other users on the same plane. Unauthorized use of our, or our third-party service providers’, networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including personal information of passengers using our service. Data security threats are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time, and may include ransomware attacks, network intrusion, data extortion, malware, phishing and other social engineering, business email compromise and insider threats, among others. There can be no assurance that any security measures we, or third parties, take will be effective in preventing these activities, given the constantly changing nature of the threats. Any such security incidents, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under our contracts with certain customers, which generally require us to indemnify the customer for passenger and other third-party claims arising from data security breaches. In addition, such incidents may disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, result in the loss of value of trade secrets, require expensive efforts to investigate, remediate or resolve, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. A security incident or data breach, a failure to comply with applicable data protection laws, failure to comply with our policies and procedures, or a failure or perceived failure to provide users with adequate notice of our privacy policies or other privacy-related obligations to consumers could also subject us to litigation, investigations and regulatory penalties imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies, non-U.S. regulatory agencies or courts, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Business—Licenses and Regulation—Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations,” we could also be subject to certain state laws, federal and non-U.S. laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these rules or regulations, or an allegation or finding that we failed to comply, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These legal requirements are complex, 25 varied, rapidly evolving and often subject to interpretation, and there is a risk that, despite our efforts to comply, we may be found to be out of compliance with one or more of these requirements. Fines issued for non-compliance with such requirements may be substantial, including fines issued under the GDPR which can be as high as 4% of global revenue, and an adverse finding by a regulator or court may result in costly and onerous requirements being placed on the Company, a prohibition on engaging in certain aspects of our business or damage to our reputation. Certain data protection laws that apply to the Company establish a private right of action. In addition, non-compliance with certain of these requirements could lead to class action or other litigation based on theories that may include breach of contract or negligence, among others. Such litigation could result in material costs to the Company. We cannot be sure that a regulator would deem our security measures to be appropriate given the lack of prescriptive measures in certain data protection laws. Without more specific guidance, we cannot know whether our chosen security safeguards are adequate according to each applicable data protection law. Even in cases where the applicable requirements are explicit, we cannot be certain that safeguards designed to meet those requirements will be interpreted by a regulator or court as adequate or that those safeguards are operating in accordance with the requirements at all times. Given the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be sure that our chosen security safeguards will protect against security threats to our business, nor can we be certain that we have not already experienced a cybersecurity incident or data breach of which we are unaware. Even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our or our partners’ information technology systems and the data contained in those systems. Moreover, interpretations or changes to new or existing data protection laws may impose on us responsibility for our employees and third parties that assist with aspects of our data processing. As a result, our employees’ or third parties’ intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase our vulnerability or expose us to security threats, such as phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for a successful phishing or other social engineering attack despite the quality and otherwise legal sufficiency of our technical security measures. A cybersecurity incident, data breach or other failure of our security measures may result in litigation, fines, reputational harm, operational disruption, and lost revenue. In addition, compliance with complex variations in privacy and data security laws may require modifications to current business practices, including significant technology efforts that require long implementation timelines, increased costs and dedicated resources. We depend on the security of the network infrastructure and products of our third-party providers of telecommunications, cloud computing, customer support and other vendors. Despite our efforts, those third parties may maintain inadequate safeguards to protect data they maintain for us or services on which we depend, or they may experience a cybersecurity incident or data breach despite safeguards that appear adequate. We also rely on hardware and software developed by third parties. Such hardware and software could contain security vulnerabilities or backdoors introduced by the vendor or an unauthorized third party, which could jeopardize the security of our systems, data and networks. Such incidents or breaches could expose us to regulatory and litigation risk, operational disruption and reputational harm and adversely affect our business. Should the Company participate in the FCC Reimbursement Program, it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Business — Licenses and Regulation — FCC Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program,” we have been approved for participation in the FCC Reimbursement Program. We are currently evaluating our participation in the FCC Reimbursement Program. Due to a shortfall in the funds appropriated by Congress for the program, the FCC has allocated to the Company approximately only $131 million of the approximately $333 million approved for reimbursement. There can be no assurance that Congress will appropriate any additional funds. If Congress fails to appropriate funds sufficient to fund all of the approved expenditures of the Company and other participants and we nevertheless decide to participate, we will be required to fund the portion of program costs that exceeds the FCC allocation, which currently amounts to approximately $202 million. In order to participate in the program, we must comply with various conditions and requirements established by the FCC, including a requirement that we submit our first reimbursement request by July 15, 2023, and complete the removal, replacement and disposal of applicable equipment within one year following such request. The FCC may grant one or more six-month extensions to a participant where it finds that due to factors beyond its control, the participant cannot complete the project by the deadline. Due to a number of factors including supply chain disruptions, the current insufficiency of FCC funding and the operational and logistical complexity of replacing airborne equipment, we do not believe that we can complete the project by July 2024, and we intend to seek extensions if we decide to participate. If the FCC does not grant the necessary extensions and the project is not completed by the FCC’s deadline, we could face penalties or other sanctions. In addition, if any of the Company’s customers do not replace their airborne equipment with equipment that is compatible with the replacement terrestrial network equipment prior to the date on which the replacement terrestrial network equipment goes into effect, the Company will be unable to provide service to such customers until the airborne equipment is replaced. Such service disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We are subject to the FCPA, the Bribery Act and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions around the world. The FCPA, the Bribery Act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies, their officers, 26 directors, employees and third-party intermediaries, business partners and agents from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, resellers and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures and internal controls to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. To the extent that we learn that any of our employees, third-party intermediaries, agents, or business partners do not adhere to our policies, procedures, or internal controls, we are committed to taking appropriate remedial action. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our directors, officers, employees, third-party intermediaries, agents, or business partners have or may have violated such laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. Detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time, resources and attention from senior management. Any violation of the FCPA, the Bribery Act, or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, fines and penalties, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Expenses, liabilities or business disruptions resulting from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operations are characterized by the use of new technologies and services across multiple jurisdictions that implicate various statutes and a range of rules and regulations that may be subject to broad or creative interpretation. This may result in litigation, including class action lawsuits, the outcome of which may be difficult to assess or quantify due to the potential ambiguity inherent in these regulatory schemes and/or the nascence of our technologies and services. Plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products and services, or require us to pay significant monetary damages, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, we recently settled a securities class action lawsuit in which Gogo Inc. and certain of our current and former executives were defendants, and in February 2023, we received preliminary court approval to settle related derivative lawsuits in which Gogo Inc. is a nominal defendant and members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former executives are defendants. We are required to indemnify the directors and current and former officers who are defendants in the derivative lawsuit for their defense costs and any judgments resulting from such suits. In the future, we may be subject to additional securities class action or derivative litigation. From time to time, we may also be subject to other claims or litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including for example, claims related to employment matters. In addition, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce our existing contracts and, even if successful, may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation by or against any customer or supplier could have the effect of negatively impacting our reputation and goodwill with existing and potential customers and suppliers. We may be affected by global climate change or by legal and regulatory responses to such change. Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements. Increased regulation regarding GHG emissions, especially aircraft emissions, could impose substantial costs on us. We may also incur additional expenses as a result of U.S. and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions. The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal, regional, state or local legislation, regulations or other initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Regulations related to conflict minerals force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex. We are subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which requires us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals.” These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of certain of the materials used in the manufacture of components in our products and equipment. In addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 27 For definitions of capitalized terms used and not defined in the following Risk Factors, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment. As of December 31, 2022, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $714.1 million, all of which was borrowed under the Term Loan Facility. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future, including up to $100.0 million under the Revolving Facility, which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to: We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all. We have from time to time evaluated, and we continue to evaluate, our potential capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, limitations on bandwidth capacity and performance and generally evolving technology in our industry. We may utilize one or more types of capital raising in order to fund any initiative in this regard, including the issuance of new equity securities and new debt securities, including debt securities convertible into our common stock. Our ability to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and the extent and timing of certain capital and other necessary expenditures are subject to numerous variables, such as costs related to execution of our current technology roadmap, including continuing development and deployment of Gogo 5G, Global Broadband and other future technologies. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all or our operating cash flows may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the 2021 Credit Agreement and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited by the 2021 Credit Agreement. In the future, if our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios or other covenant exceptions set forth in the 2021 Credit Agreement, our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness, which indebtedness may be secured or unsecured, the incurrence of which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to comply with these requirements. The 2021 Credit Agreement also limits the ability of Gogo Inc. to incur additional indebtedness under certain circumstances and limits the amount of cash that our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us. The terms of any additional financing may further limit our financial and operating flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to 28 obtain additional financing, we may be required to use the proceeds from any such financing to repay a portion of our outstanding debt. If we raise additional funds or seek to reduce our current levels of indebtedness through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and we may grant holders of such securities rights with respect to the governance and operations of our business. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could adversely impact our ability to operate our business. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, us to: Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the 2021 Credit Agreement may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such agreements and instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, may limit our ability in the future to satisfy currently outstanding obligations and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. An increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could reduce our profitability. Our debt outstanding under the Term Loan Facility bears interest, and any indebtedness under our Revolving Facility would bear interest, at variable rates. While we have entered into interest rate caps to hedge a portion of our exposure, we remain subject to interest rate risk under these facilities. Increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Any payments made under our interest rate caps are based on the three-month LIBOR interest rate. The upcoming cessation of the availability of LIBOR may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop encouraging or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, and FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator, or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, for all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (the “LIBOR Announcement”). It is not possible to predict the effect that the LIBOR Announcement, the discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR, but financial products with interest rates tied to LIBOR may be adversely affected. Once LIBOR ceases to be published, it is uncertain whether it will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. We amended our 2021 Credit Agreement on February 2, 2023 to transition to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“SOFR”) in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation. Any indebtedness under our 2021 Credit Agreement may bear interest at variable rates that use the forward-looking term rate based on SOFR. SOFR is calculated differently than LIBOR and has inherent differences, which could give rise to uncertainties, including the limited historical 29 data and volatility in the benchmark rates. We intend to transition our interest rate caps from LIBOR to SOFR before LIBOR’s discontinuation. The full effects of the transition to SOFR remain uncertain. Indebtedness under the Facilities is secured by substantially all of our assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities, if we were to become insolvent, to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our secured indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility. Indebtedness under the Facilities is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, if an event of default were to occur under the 2021 Credit Agreement, to the extent amounts were outstanding under the Facilities, the lenders party to the 2021 Credit Agreement would have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations under the 2021 Credit Agreement, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries’ unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility. A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us, our subsidiaries or our indebtedness, if any, could cause our cost of capital to increase. Our Term Loan has been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline. The trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our IPO, which occurred on June 21, 2013 and in which shares of common stock were sold at a price of $17.00 per share. From the IPO date through February 24, 2023, the price of our common stock has ranged from a closing low of $1.40 per share to a closing high of $34.34 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include: 30 In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many such companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an “ownership change” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $562 million in federal and $448 million in state net operating losses (“NOLs”). The federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2032. The state NOLs expire in various tax years beginning in 2023. Under Section 382 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as an increase of more than 50% of the value of the Company’s stock owned by certain “5-percent shareholders,” as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code, in its equity ownership over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. To the extent there becomes a new 5-percent shareholder, we may experience an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code, which may result in the loss or impairment of some or all of our NOLs. The extent of any loss or impairment of our NOLs upon an ownership change would depend on several factors, including the nature of the NOLs, our stock price and extent of the ownership change. In September 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 Rights Agreement (as amended, the “Rights Agreement”), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, and declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company outstanding on the record date of October 2, 2020, to the stockholders of record on that date. The Rights Agreement is designed to facilitate the Company’s ability to protect its NOLs and certain other tax attributes in order to be able to offset potential future income taxes for federal income tax purposes. The Rights Agreement may make it more difficult for the Company to undergo an ownership change by deterring a third party from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the shares of our common stock then outstanding. Beneficial ownership for purposes of the Rights Agreement is determined based on meeting one of several criteria, including (i) actual or constructive ownership pursuant to Section 382 of the Code and related regulations thereunder and (ii) beneficial ownership, directly or indirectly, within the meaning of Rules 13d-3 or 13d-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The limitations set forth in the Rights Agreement may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging any individual or entity, together with their affiliates and associates, from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the shares of our common stock then outstanding. In addition, although the Rights Agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect utilization of our NOLs, the Rights Agreement has been, and may be, ineffective at deterring shareholders from becoming 5-percent shareholders. For example, in September 2022 and December 2022, two institutional shareholders inadvertently crossed the 4.9% beneficial ownership threshold. In both such circumstances, our Board of Directors, rather than allowing a distribution of Rights to be triggered, determined that it was in the best interests of the Company to grant requests by such shareholders that they each be deemed an “Exempt Person” under the Rights Agreement. Each exemption required that the shareholder satisfy certain ownership conditions intended to prevent an ownership change and protect our ability to utilize our NOLs. Moreover, pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, our Board of Directors may determine that it is in the best interests of the Company to exempt certain transactions, which could result in an ownership change, from triggering the Rights Agreement. Failure by an “Exempt Person” or other persons exempt from certain transaction under the Rights Agreement to comply with the conditions for such exemptions could result in an ownership change and result in the loss or impairment of some or all of our NOLs. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOLs is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. 31 Future stock issuances could cause substantial dilution and a decline in our stock price. We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangement, as consideration to third-party service or equipment providers or otherwise. Additional shares of common stock are also issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options. We may also reserve additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or other similar forms of equity incentives. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. A few significant stockholders, including affiliates of Oakleigh Thorne, our Chairman of the Board and CEO, and GTCR LLC and its affiliates, could exert influence over our company, and if the ownership of our common stock continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. As of December 31, 2022, Oakleigh Thorne, our CEO and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, and the entities affiliated with Mr. Thorne (the “Thorne Entities”) beneficially owned approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and funds managed by GTCR LLC and its affiliates (“GTCR”) beneficially owned approximately 25% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, either the Thorne Entities or GTCR alone is able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including approval of significant corporate transactions and the election of directors. Such ability to influence may reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, together, GTCR and the Thorne Entities would be able to exercise control over such matters, which similarly may reduce the market price of our common stock. As our CEO, Mr. Thorne has control over our day-to-day management and the implementation of major strategic initiatives and investments by our company, subject to authorization and oversight by our Board of Directors. As a member of our Board of Directors, Mr. Thorne owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Thorne is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interest, which may not always be in the interests of stockholders generally. Our corporate governance guidelines address potential conflicts between a director’s interests and our interests, and our code of business conduct, among other things, requires our employees and directors to avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with their job responsibilities or our interests and to disclose their outside activities, financial interests or relationships that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict to management or corporate counsel. These corporate governance guidelines and code of business ethics do not, by themselves, prohibit transactions with the Thorne Entities. Fulfilling our obligations associated with being a public company is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price. As a public company, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”), and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as NASDAQ rules, require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public company obligations requires us to devote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. We are also required under Sarbanes-Oxley to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls may materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ, or other regulatory authorities. 32 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, and certain provisions in our existing and any future credit facility could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include: Additionally, our Board of Directors adopted the Rights Agreement, which is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code by deterring a third party from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the shares of our common stock then outstanding. The Rights Agreement, as well as the provisions described above, may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of the Rights Agreement or such provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. The Rights Agreement as well as the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management or Board of Directors. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. Under the terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement, a takeover of our company would allow the administrative agent and/or the lenders to terminate their commitments under the 2021 Credit Agreement and declare any and all outstanding amounts to be due and payable. This provision may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership by non-U.S. citizens, including the power of our Board of Directors to redeem shares of our common stock from non-U.S. citizens. The Communications Act and FCC regulations impose restrictions on foreign ownership of FCC licensees, as described in the above risk factor, “— Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property—If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license .” Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions that permit our Board of Directors to take certain actions in order to comply with FCC regulations regarding foreign ownership, including but not limited to, a right to redeem shares of common stock from non-U.S. citizens at prices at or below fair market value. Non-U.S. citizens should consider carefully the redemption provisions in our certificate of incorporation prior to investing in our common stock. These restrictions may also decrease the liquidity and value of our stock by reducing the pool of potential investors in our company and making the acquisition of control of us by third parties more difficult. In addition, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to attract equity financing or consummate an acquisition of a foreign entity using shares of our capital stock. 33 Item 1B. Unresolv ed Staff Comments None. Item 2. Pr operties Currently, we lease approximately 120,000 square feet for our business in Broomfield, Colorado, under a lease agreement that expires in 2029. In addition, we lease approximately 11,700 square feet in Chicago, Illinois for those of our employees who live in the metropolitan Chicago area under a lease agreement that expires on May 31, 2032. We believe that our existing facilities will be adequate for the foreseeable future. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to several lawsuits arising out of the conduct of our business. See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of litigation matters. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material adverse impact on our company due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted, which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as damages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs. Item 4. Mine Saf ety Disclosures Not applicable. 34 Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information for Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “GOGO” since June 21, 2013. Holders of Record As of February 24, 2023, there were 33 stockholders of record of our common stock, and the closing price of our common stock was $14.50 per share as reported on the NASDAQ. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. Repurchases of Equity Securities None. Recent Sale of Unregistered Securities None. Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities None.

The following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total return for our common stock, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (“S&P 500”), the Nasdaq Composite Index (“NASDAQ Composite”) and Standard & Poor’s SmallCap 600 Index (“S&P SmallCap 600”) for the period from December 31, 2017 through December 30, 2022, the last trading day of 2022. The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the market close on December 31, 2017 in our common stock, the S&P 500, the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P SmallCap 600 and assumes reinvestments of dividends, if any. The S&P SmallCap 600 was chosen because we do not believe we can reasonably identify an industry index or specific peer issuer that would offer a meaningful comparison. The S&P SmallCap 600 35 represents a broad-based index of companies with similar market capitalization. The comparisons in the graph below are based upon historical data and are not indicative of, nor intended to forecast, future performance of our common stock. Item 6. [Reserved] 36 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On December 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our commercial aviation (“CA”) business to a subsidiary of Intelsat Jackson Holdings S.A. (“Intelsat”) for a purchase price of $400.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the “Transaction”). As a result, all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as discontinued operations. There was no discontinued operations activity for the CA business after December 31, 2021. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Our fiscal year ends December 31 and, unless otherwise noted, references to years or fiscal are for fiscal years ended December 31. See “— Results of Operations.” Company Overview Gogo is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. We have served this market for more than 25 years. Our mission is to enrich the lives of passengers and the efficiency of operators with the world’s best business aviation in-flight connectivity and customer support. We have always sought to provide the best connectivity for the business aviation market regardless of technology, and we have a successful history of doing so. Until recently, we focused primarily on business aviation aircraft in North America, which comprise approximately 63% of the worldwide business aviation fleet, and we are the leading provider of in-flight connectivity in that market. Gogo started in analogue air-to-ground (“ATG”) technology in the late 1990s, then, as analogue cellular backhaul disappeared, migrated to narrowband satellite connectivity in the early 2000s, then back to ATG with our digital broadband 3G and 4G networks beginning in 2010. We expect to commercially launch our fourth ATG network – Gogo 5G – in the fourth quarter of 2023. We also continue to provide narrowband satellite services to customers in North America and internationally through distribution agreements with satellite providers. In May 2022, in order to further serve our existing customers and expand our target market, we announced plans to expand our broadband offerings beyond ATG by launching the first global broadband service designed for business aviation (“Global Broadband”). The service will use an electronically steered antenna (“ESA”), specifically designed to address a broad range of business aviation aircraft, operating on a low earth orbit (“LEO”) satellite network. The antenna will be designed with Hughes Network Systems, LLC (“Hughes”) and utilized on a LEO satellite network operated by Network Access Associates Limited (“OneWeb”). Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and business results for our operations, and makes resource and operating decisions, on a consolidated basis. As we do not have multiple segments, we do not present segment information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations We believe that our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that affect the business aviation industry, including trends affecting the travel industry and trends affecting the customer bases that we target, as well as factors that affect wireless Internet service providers and general macroeconomic factors. Key factors that may affect our future performance include: 37 Key Business Metrics Our management regularly reviews financial and operating metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate the performance of our business and our success in executing our business plan, make decisions regarding resource allocation and corporate strategies, and evaluate forward-looking projections. For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Aircraft online (at period end) ATG 6,935 6,400 5,778 Satellite 4,475 4,567 4,702 Average monthly connectivity service revenue per aircraft online ATG $ 3,349 $ 3,238 $ 2,951 Satellite 268 250 212 Units sold ATG 1,334 869 667 Satellite 206 205 199 Average equipment revenue per unit sold (in thousands) ATG $ 68 $ 71 $ 68 Satellite 49 54 59 38 Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations As a result of the Transaction, all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as a discontinued operation. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. The results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented. Refer to Note 20, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements for further information. The following briefly describes certain key components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Revenue: We generate two types of revenue: service revenue and equipment revenue. Service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services. Service revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Beginning December 2020, service revenue includes revenue earned from the ATG Network Sharing Agreement with Intelsat. Equipment revenue primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of ATG and narrowband satellite connectivity equipment and is recognized when control of the equipment is transferred to OEMs and dealers, which generally occurs when the equipment is shipped. Cost of Revenue: Cost of service revenue consists of ATG network costs, satellite provider service costs, transaction costs and costs related to network operations. Cost of equipment revenue primarily consists of the costs of purchasing component parts used in the manufacture of our equipment and the production, installation, technical support and quality assurance costs associated with the equipment sales. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses include the costs incurred to design and develop our technologies and products and to obtain and maintain FAA and other regulatory certifications. This includes the design, development and integration of our ATG ground networks and airborne line replaceable units, the design and development of products and enhancements thereto, and program management activities. Engineering, design and development expenses also include costs associated with enhancements to existing products. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with activities related to customer sales (including sales commissions), digital marketing and lead generation, advertising and promotions, product management, trade shows and customer service support for end users. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses include personnel and related operating costs of the business support functions, including finance and accounting, legal, human resources, administrative, information technology, facilities and executive groups. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation expense includes expense associated with the depreciation of our network equipment, office equipment and furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements, which is recorded over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense includes the amortization of our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to ten years depending on the assets being amortized. 39 Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related exposures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In some instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets have the greatest potential impact on and are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and that they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies to which many of these critical estimates relate, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements. Note that these critical accounting estimates relate solely to our continuing operations. The accounting policies related to our discontinued operations are discussed in Note 20, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements. Deferred Income Taxes - Valuation Allowance: We account for the valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets, which includes consideration of both positive and negative evidence to determine, based on the weight of the available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In our assessment, we consider recent financial operating results, the scheduled expiration of our net operating losses, potential sources of taxable income, the reversal of existing taxable differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted under tax law) and tax planning strategies. We have a recent history of financial reporting losses, primarily driven by our divested CA business, resulting in cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter which is objectively verifiable negative evidence regarding future profitability. Cumulative pre-tax losses from continuing operations adjusted for the reduction in interest expense resulting from the Refinancing and the settlement of the 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) result in positive normalized income over the same three-year period. This is objectively verifiable positive evidence of our ability to generate positive earnings in the future. When there is a recent history of operating losses and a return to operating profitability has not yet been demonstrated, we cannot rely on projections of future earnings for purposes of assessing recoverability of our deferred tax assets and instead must use our historical earnings for this assessment. In such cases, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. Our determination that we are more likely than not to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets represents our best estimate and considers both positive and negative factors. We considered positive factors including the sale of our CA business, the reduction in interest expense resulting from the Refinancing and the settlement of the 2022 Convertible Notes, strong demand for our products and services and pre-tax income from continuing operations in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2021. The negative factors included cumulative pre-tax losses from continuing operations in the three-year period ending with the current quarter and our relatively short history of pre-tax income from continuing operations. It is possible that there will be changes in our business, our performance, our industry or otherwise that cause actual results to differ materially from this estimate. If those changes result in significant and sustained reductions in our pre-tax income or utilization of existing tax carryforwards in future periods, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or other comprehensive income. Such adverse impacts may be material. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our determination that we are more likely than not to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets resulted in a release of approximately $11.4 million of our valuation allowance. The remaining valuation allowance is still required for deferred tax assets related to certain state and foreign NOLs, capital losses, and the Section 163(j) interest limitation carryforward, as we determined that it was more likely than not that, as of December 31, 2022, these deferred tax assets will not be realized. See Note 15, “Income Tax,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 40 Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our consolidated statements of operations. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Consolidated Statements of Operations Data (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Revenue: Service revenue $ 296,329 $ 259,583 $ 211,987 Equipment revenue 107,738 76,133 57,731 Total revenue 404,067 335,716 269,718 Operating expenses: Cost of service revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 64,427 56,103 45,073 Cost of equipment revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 71,473 46,092 39,299 Engineering, design and development 29,587 24,874 25,227 Sales and marketing 25,471 20,985 15,135 General and administrative 58,203 51,554 54,467 Depreciation and amortization 12,580 15,482 14,166 Total operating expenses 261,741 215,090 193,367 Operating income 142,326 120,626 76,351 Other (income) expense: Interest income (2,386 ) (191 ) (722 ) Interest expense 38,872 67,472 125,787 Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes — 83,961 — Other (income) expense 123 25 (9 ) Total other expense 36,609 151,267 125,056 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 105,717 (30,641 ) (48,705 ) Income tax provision (benefit) 13,658 (187,230 ) (146 ) Net income (loss) from continuing operations 92,059 156,589 (48,559 ) Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax — (3,854 ) (201,477 ) Net income (loss) $ 92,059 $ 152,735 $ (250,036 ) Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenue: Revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years Ended December 31, % Change 2022 2021 2022 over 2021 Service revenue $ 296,329 $ 259,583 14.2 % Equipment revenue 107,738 76,133 41.5 % Total revenue $ 404,067 $ 335,716 20.4 % Revenue increased to $404.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $335.7 million for the prior year, due to increases in service and equipment revenue. Service revenue increased to $296.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $259.6 million for the prior year, primarily due to increases in ATG aircraft online and average monthly service revenue per ATG aircraft online. Average monthly service revenue per ATG unit online increased to $3,349 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $3,238 for the prior year. 41 Equipment revenue increased to $107.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $76.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to increases in the number of ATG units sold, with 1,334 ATG units sold during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared with 869 units for the prior year. We expect service revenue to increase in the future as additional ATG aircraft come online and average monthly connectivity service revenue per ATG aircraft online increases, due in part to the expected impact of the launch of Gogo 5G. We expect equipment revenue to increase in the future as a larger number of ATG units, including Gogo 5G units, are sold. In addition, we expect further revenue growth as we launch Global Broadband. Cost of Revenue: Cost of service revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years Ended December 31, % Change 2022 2021 2022 over 2021 Cost of service revenue $ 64,427 $ 56,103 14.8 % Cost of equipment revenue $ 71,473 $ 46,092 55.1 % Cost of service revenue increased to $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $56.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to increases in personnel costs and ATG network costs as well as a credit for regulatory surcharges included in the prior year, with no corresponding credit in the current year. We expect cost of service revenue to increase over time, primarily due to service revenue growth and increasing ATG network costs associated with Gogo 5G. In addition, we expect cost of service revenue to increase as we launch Global Broadband. Cost of equipment revenue increased to $71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $46.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in ATG units sold. We expect that our cost of equipment revenue will increase with growth in ATG units sold, including Gogo 5G units following the launch of that service, and Global Broadband units sold following the launch of that service. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses increased to $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $24.9 million for the prior year, primarily due to commencement of the Global Broadband development program. We expect engineering, design and development expenses as a percentage of service revenue to increase over the next two years, driven by Global Broadband development costs and Gogo 5G program spend, and decrease over the long term as the level of investment decreases and revenue increases. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses increased to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $21.0 million for the prior year, primarily due to increased personnel, travel, promotional and advertising expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of service revenue to remain relatively flat in the future. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses increased to $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $51.6 million for the prior year, primarily due to increases in legal expenses and stock-based compensation expense. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenue to decrease over time. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $15.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreased amortization expense for capitalized software. We expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase in the future as we launch our Gogo 5G network. 42 Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years % Change Ended December 31, 2022 over 2022 2021 2021 Interest income $ (2,386 ) $ (191 ) 1149.2 % Interest expense 38,872 67,472 (42.4 )% Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes — 83,961 nm Other expense, net 123 25 392.0 % Total $ 36,609 $ 151,267 (75.8 )% Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with nm. Total other expense decreased to $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared with $151.3 million for the prior year, primarily due to the prior year including the loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes as well as lower interest expense in the current year as a result of the Refinancing, the benefit from our interest rate caps and the conversion of all outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes that occurred in May 2022. We expect our interest expense to fluctuate with changes in the variable rates associated with the Facilities, with increases partially offset by the impact of our interest rate caps. See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 12.9%, as compared with 611.0% for the prior year. The income tax expense of $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to pre-tax income, partially offset by the partial release of the valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets and the tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. The income tax benefit of $187.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a result of a partial release of the valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets during the year. See Note 15, “Income Tax,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. We expect our income tax provision to increase in the long term as we continue to generate positive pre-tax income, which we expect to be at least partially offset by reversals of our valuation allowance within the next twelve months. Discontinued Operations: For the year ended December 31, 2021, the loss from discontinued operations of $3.9 million was primarily related to stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by the recognition of a gain on sale of discontinued operations recorded as a deferred gain on sale at December 31, 2020. See Note 20, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on March 3, 2022, includes a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021. Non-GAAP Measures In our discussion below, we discuss Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as defined below, which are non-GAAP financial measurements. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow for business planning purposes, including managing our business against internally projected results of operations and measuring our performance and liquidity. These supplemental performance measures also provide another basis for comparing period-to-period results by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. These supplemental performance measures may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not recognized measurements under GAAP; when analyzing our performance with Adjusted EBITDA or liquidity with Free Cash Flow, as applicable, investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure, and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments, (ii) use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative to, net income (loss) attributable to common stock as a measure of operating results and (iii) use Free Cash Flow in addition to, and not as an alternative to, consolidated net cash provided by operating activities when evaluating our liquidity. 43 Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA represents net income (loss) attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) stock-based compensation expense included in the results of continuing operations, (ii) the results of discontinued operations, including stock-based compensation expense and the gain on the sale of CA, (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes and (iv) separation costs related to the sale of CA. Our management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that management believes have less bearing on our operating performance, thereby highlighting trends in our core business which may not otherwise be apparent. It also provides an assessment of controllable expenses, which are indicators management uses to determine whether current spending decisions need to be adjusted in order to meet financial goals and achieve optimal financial performance. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense from Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate given the significant variation in expense that can result from using the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of such compensation. The fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model and varies based on fluctuations in the assumptions used in this model, including inputs that are not necessarily directly related to the performance of our business, such as the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the options. Therefore, we believe that the exclusion of this cost provides a clearer view of the operating performance of our business. Further, stock option grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. While we believe that investors should have information about any dilutive effect of outstanding options and the cost of that compensation, we also believe that stockholders should have the ability to consider our performance using a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these costs and that management uses to evaluate our business. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the results of our discontinued operations from Adjusted EBITDA because they are not part of our ongoing operations. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes from Adjusted EBITDA because this activity is not related to our operating performance. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude separation costs related to the sale of CA from Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 because of the non-recurring nature of this activity. We also present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides investors, securities analysts and other users of our consolidated financial statements with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management. Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities, plus the proceeds from our interest rate caps, less purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of intangible assets and cash paid to purchase our interest rate caps. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides meaningful information regarding our liquidity. To conform to current year presentation, we included the cash paid for our interest rate caps in Free Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our liquidity to include the cash flows associated with interest rate caps to facilitate a more consistent comparison of net cash paid for interest and the interest rate changes for which we are hedged. 44 Gogo Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (in thousands, except per share amounts) (unaudited) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Adjusted EBITDA: Net income (loss) attributable to common stock (GAAP) $ 92,059 $ 152,735 $ (250,036 ) Interest expense 38,872 67,472 125,787 Interest income (2,386 ) (191 ) (722 ) Income tax provision (benefit) 13,658 (187,230 ) (146 ) Depreciation and amortization 12,580 15,482 14,166 EBITDA 154,783 48,268 (110,951 ) Stock-based compensation expense 19,065 13,345 7,808 Loss from discontinued operations — 3,854 201,477 Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes — 83,961 — Separation costs related to CA sale — 1,550 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 173,848 $ 150,978 $ 98,334 Free Cash Flow: Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 103,405 $ 66,697 $ 4,513 Consolidated capital expenditures (49,914 ) (8,660 ) (8,990 ) Proceeds from (purchase of) interest rate caps 4,292 (8,629 ) — Free cash flow $ 57,783 $ 49,408 $ (4,477 ) Material limitations of Non-GAAP measures Although EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are measurements frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow each have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include: Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically financed our growth and cash needs primarily through the issuance of common stock, non-convertible debt, senior convertible preferred stock, convertible debt, credit facilities and cash from operating activities. We continually evaluate our ongoing capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, capacity requirements, evolving user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience, evolving technologies in our industry and related strategic, operational and technological opportunities. If needed, we consider opportunities to raise additional capital in the public and private markets, utilizing one or more of the types of capital raising transactions through which we have historically financed our growth and cash needs, as well as other means of capital raising not previously used by us. 45 See the disclosure below under the heading “Debt Instruments” for the definitions of the debt and convertible debt instruments to which we refer in this section, as well as the indentures and other agreements that govern them. Based on our current plans, we expect that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operating activities and access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of our business, including capital expenditure requirements and debt maturities, for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. As detailed in Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” on April 30, 2021, GIH entered into the 2021 Credit Agreement with Gogo, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which provides for the Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $725.0 million, issued with a discount of 0.5%, and the Revolving Facility, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility. On February 2, 2023, Gogo and GIH entered into an amendment to the Original 2021 Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which replaced all references in the Original 2021 Credit Agreement to LIBOR in respect of the applicable interest rates for the Facilities with an adjusted term SOFR rate, plus a credit spread adjustment based on the Alternative Reference Rates Committee recommended spread adjustment. The Term Loan Facility amortizes in nominal quarterly installments equal to 1% of the aggregate initial principal amount thereof per annum, with the remaining balance payable upon final maturity on April 30, 2028. There are no amortization payments under the Revolving Facility, and all borrowings under the Revolving Facility mature on April 30, 2026. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of GIH and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Further, market conditions and/or our financial performance may limit our access to additional sources of equity or debt financing, or our ability to pursue potential strategic alternatives. As a result, we may be unable to finance the growth of our business to the extent that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash generated through operating activities prove insufficient or we are unable to raise additional financing through the issuance of equity, permitted incurrences of debt (by us or by GIH and its subsidiaries), or the pursuit of potential strategic alternatives. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used, together with cash on hand, (i) to redeem in full and pay the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes together with accrued and unpaid interest and redemption premiums and to pay fees associated with the termination of the ABL Credit Agreement (together with the redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the “Refinancing”), and (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing and the Facilities (the “Transaction Costs”). The Revolving Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes of Gogo and its subsidiaries and was undrawn as of December 31, 2022. In May 2022, the remaining $102.8 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was converted by holders into 17,131,332 shares of common stock. In May 2021, we purchased interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of $650.0 million for $8.6 million. We receive payments in the amounts calculated pursuant to the caps for any period in which the three-month USD LIBOR rate increases beyond the applicable strike rate. The termination date of the cap agreements is July 31, 2027. The notional amounts of the interest rate caps periodically decrease over the life of the caps with the first reduction of $125 million occurring on July 31, 2023. While the interest rate caps are intended to limit our interest rate exposure under our variable rate indebtedness, which includes the Facilities, if our variable rate indebtedness does not decrease in proportion to the periodic decreases in the notional amount hedged under the interest rate caps, then the portion of such indebtedness that will be effectively hedged against possible increases in interest rates will decrease. In addition, the strike prices periodically increase over the life of the caps. As a result, the extent to which the interest rate caps will limit our interest rate exposure will decrease in the future. For additional information on the interest rate caps, see Note 10, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” to our consolidated financial statements. 46 Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations, comprised of our material future cash requirements and deferred revenue arrangements, as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands) . Less than 1-3 3-5 More than Total 1 year years years 5 years Contractual Obligations: Finance lease obligations $ 147 $ 141 $ 4 $ 2 $ — Operating lease obligations 113,682 14,499 29,314 27,239 42,630 Purchase obligations (1) 369,180 123,731 64,909 10,500 170,040 Term Loan Facility (2) 714,125 7,250 14,500 14,500 677,875 Interest and fees on the Facilities (2)(3) 309,035 59,240 116,839 114,278 18,678 Deferred revenue arrangements (4) 3,430 3,418 12 — — Other long-term obligations (5) 41,405 9,146 4,723 1,865 25,671 Total $ 1,551,004 $ 217,425 $ 230,301 $ 168,384 $ 934,894 Contractual Commitments: We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase hardware components and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the hardware components or as development services are provided. See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Leases and Cell Site Contracts: We have lease agreements relating to certain facilities and equipment, which are considered operating leases. See Note 16, “Leases,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Indemnifications and Guarantees : In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. 47 Cash Flows The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cash flows from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 103,405 $ 66,697 $ 4,513 Net cash used in investing activities (70,418 ) (16,289 ) (8,990 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (28,388 ) (331,037 ) 44,479 Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations — (9,013 ) 220,139 Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash 13 40 (1,946 ) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 4,612 (289,602 ) 258,195 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 146,268 435,870 177,675 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 150,880 $ 146,268 $ 435,870 Supplemental information: Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 150,880 $ 146,268 $ 435,870 Less: current restricted cash — 25 525 Less: non-current restricted cash 330 330 — Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 150,550 $ 145,913 $ 435,345 Following is a discussion of the year-over-year changes in cash flow activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations: The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net income (loss) $ 92,059 $ 156,589 $ (48,559 ) Non-cash charges and credits 51,110 (69,027 ) 42,677 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (39,764 ) (20,865 ) 10,395 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 103,405 $ 66,697 $ 4,513 For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $103.4 million, as compared with cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $66.7 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the increase in operating cash flows were: For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $66.7 million, as compared with cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $4.5 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the increase in operating cash flows were: 48 Cash paid for taxes totaled $0.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We expect cash tax payments to be immaterial for an extended period of time, subject to the availability of our net operating losses. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations: Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $70.4 million, $16.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Investing activities are primarily comprised of capital expenditures related to software development, data center upgrades and cell site construction. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 included proceeds of $4.3 million from interest rate caps, while cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 included $8.6 million for the purchase of interest rate caps. Additionally, cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 included the purchase of short-term investments for $24.8 million. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations: Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $28.4 million, primarily due to the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of common stock in a private transaction and principal repayments on the Term Loan Facility. See Note 3, “Earnings (Loss) Per Share,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the repurchase of common stock. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $331.0 million, primarily due to the redemption of all of our outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes (including the make-whole premium payable under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes) for a redemption price totaling $1,023.1 million and the payment of $20.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with the issuance of the Facilities, offset in part by $721.4 million of gross proceeds from the Term Loan Facility. Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $44.5 million, primarily due to the $51.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of additional 2024 Senior Secured Notes, offset by the repurchase of convertible notes, payments on finance leases and stock-based compensation activity. Net cash used in discontinued operations: Cash used in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $9.0 million, primarily due to $7.8 million used in investing activities for a payment to Intelsat in settlement of working capital adjustments relating to the Transaction and $1.2 million used in operating activities primarily to pay the employer portion of taxes related to the vesting of equity awards and the exercise of stock options. Capital Expenditures Our business requires significant capital expenditures, primarily for technology development, equipment and capacity expansion. Capital spending for continuing operations for the periods presented in this report is associated with the expansion of our ATG network and data centers. We capitalized software development costs related to network technology solutions and new product/service offerings. We also capitalized costs related to the build-out of our office locations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures for our former CA business, presented as discontinued operations, included the purchase of airborne equipment related to the roll out and/or upgrade of service to our former airline partners’ fleets. Capital expenditures for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $49.9 million, $8.7 million and $9.0 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to the build out of Gogo 5G, and the decrease in capital expenditures in 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily due a decrease in capitalized software, partially offset by an increase in network-related equipment. We expect that our capital expenditures will decrease over time as we complete the Gogo 5G program. 49 Debt Instruments Following is a discussion of the debt instruments we had in place as of December 31, 2022 as well as those we utilized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 2021 Credit Agreement On April 30, 2021, Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) (“GIH”) entered into a credit agreement (the “Original 2021 Credit Agreement,” and, as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “2021 Credit Agreement”) among Gogo, GIH, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which provides for (i) a term loan credit facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $725.0 million, issued with a discount of 0.5%, and (ii) a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility” and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Facilities”) of up to $100.0 million, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility. On February 2, 2023, Gogo and GIH entered into an amendment to the Original 2021 Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which replaced all references in the Original 2021 Credit Agreement to LIBOR in respect of the applicable interest rates for the Facilities with an adjusted term SOFR rate, plus a credit spread adjustment based on the Alternative Reference Rates Committee recommended spread adjustment. The Term Loan Facility amortizes in nominal quarterly installments equal to 1% of the aggregate initial principal amount thereof per annum, with the remaining balance payable upon final maturity on April 30, 2028. There are no amortization payments under the Revolving Facility, and all borrowings under the Revolving Facility mature on April 30, 2026. The Term Loan Facility bears annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH’s option, either (i) an adjusted term SOFR rate (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus an applicable margin of 3.75% and a credit spread adjustment based on the Alternative Reference Rates Committee recommended spread adjustments or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75%. Loans outstanding under the Revolving Facility bear annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH’s option, either (i) an adjusted term SOFR rate (subject to a floor of 0.00%) plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.25% to 3.75% per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio and a credit spread adjustment based on the Alternative Reference Rates Committee recommended spread adjustments or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25% to 2.75% per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. Additionally, unused commitments under the Revolving Facility are subject to a fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2022, the fee for unused commitments under the Revolving Facility was 0.25% and the applicable margin was 3.25%. The Facilities may be prepaid at GIH’s option at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs), subject to minimum principal payment amount requirements. Subject to certain exceptions and de minimis thresholds, the Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to: (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, insurance recovery and condemnation events, subject to reduction to 50% and 0% if specified senior secured first lien net leverage ratio targets are met; (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain debt offerings; and (iii) 50% of annual excess cash flow (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement), subject to reduction to 25% and 0% if specified senior secured first lien net leverage ratio targets are met. The Revolving Facility includes a financial covenant set at a maximum senior secured first lien net leverage ratio of 7.50:1.00, which will apply if the outstanding amount of loans and unreimbursed letter of credit drawings thereunder at the end of any fiscal quarter exceeds 35% of the aggregate of all commitments thereunder. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, which, if any of them occurred, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the Facilities to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the Revolving Facility to be terminated. 2022 Convertible Notes In November and December 2018, we issued a total of $237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. In January 2021, $1.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes was converted by holders and settled through the issuance of 166,666 shares of common stock. On March 17, 2021, Gogo entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements (the “March 2021 Exchange Agreements”) with certain holders of 2022 Convertible Notes. Pursuant to the March 2021 Exchange Agreements, such holders exchanged a total of $28,235,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes for 5,121,811 shares of our common stock on March 24, 2021. The negotiated exchange rate under the March 2021 Exchange Agreements was 181.40 shares of common stock per 50 $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on settlement of $4.4 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. On April 1, 2021, Gogo entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement (the “GTCR Exchange Agreement”) with an affiliate of funds managed by GTCR. Pursuant to the GTCR Exchange Agreement, GTCR exchanged $105,726,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes for 19,064,529 shares of our common stock on April 9, 2021. The negotiated exchange rate under the GTCR Exchange Agreement was 180.32 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on settlement of $14.6 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. In May 2022, the remaining $102,788,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes was converted by holders into 17,131,332 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes. 2024 Senior Secured Notes On April 25, 2019 (the “Issue Date”), GIH and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo Finance” and, together with GIH, the “Issuers”) issued $905.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”), at a price equal to 99.512% of their face value, under an indenture, dated as of April 25, 2019, among the Issuers, Gogo, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Issuers issued an additional $20.0 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes on May 7, 2019, which were issued at a price equal to 100.5% of their face value, and $50.0 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes on November 13, 2020, which were issued at a price equal to 103.5% of their face value. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Gogo and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Gogo Finance), subject to certain exceptions. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees were secured by certain liens on the Company’s collateral, certain of which were released upon the closing of the Transaction and the remainder on the Redemption Date as defined below. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were redeemed on May 1, 2021 (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price equal to 104.938% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the Redemption Date. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $48.1 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $15.2 million and the remaining debt discount of $1.3 million, which together are included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. ABL Credit Facility On August 26, 2019, Gogo Inc., GIH and Gogo Finance entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent, which provides for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”) of up to $30.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. The obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement were guaranteed by Gogo and all of its existing and future subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and secured by certain collateral of the Company. On April 30, 2021, the ABL Credit Agreement and all commitments thereunder were terminated. As a result of the termination, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.3 million were written off as of May 1, 2021 and included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. 2020 Convertible Notes In March 2015, we issued $361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. In 2018 and 2019, we repurchased a total of $359.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes, and on March 1, 2020, the remaining $2.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes matured. Forward Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we paid approximately $140.0 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the “Forward Transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “Forward Counterparties”), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. 51 On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to one of the Forward Transactions (the “Amended and Restated Forward Transaction”) to extend the expected settlement date with respect to approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock held by one of the Forward Counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the “2022 Forward Counterparty”), to correspond with the May 15, 2022 maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders’ equity within our consolidated balance sheets was reduced by approximately $140.0 million. In March 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. In April 2021, approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. In May 2022, the approximately 0.6 million shares that were remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transactions were delivered to us. As of December 31, 2022, there were no prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions outstanding. Restricted Cash Our restricted cash balances were $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and consisted primarily of a letter of credit issued for the benefit of the landlord of our office location in Chicago, IL. For additional information on the 2021 Credit Agreement, the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the ABL Credit Facility and the 2020 Convertible Notes, see Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” to our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and debt. We have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments through a variety of securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, and money market funds. Our cash and cash equivalents as of both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 primarily included amounts in bank deposit accounts and money market funds. As of December 31, 2022, cash equivalents and short-term investments included U.S. Treasury securities. We believe that a change in average interest rates would not affect our interest income and results of operations by a material amount. However, a change in interest rates could impact our interest income and results of operations to the extent that we invest in a material amount of interest-bearing securities. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ. Interest Rate Risk: We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate indebtedness, which includes borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility (if any). We assess our market risks based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential impact on earnings and cash flows based on a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had interest rate cap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate movements of our variable rate debt and to manage our interest expense. Currently, we receive payments in the amounts calculated pursuant to the caps for any period in which the three-month USD LIBOR rate increases beyond the applicable strike rate. The termination date of the cap agreements is July 31, 2027. Over the life of the interest rate caps, the notional amounts of the caps periodically decrease, while the applicable strike prices increase. The notional amount of outstanding debt associated with interest rate cap agreements as of December 31, 2022 was $650.0 million. Based on our December 31, 2022 outstanding variable rate debt balance, a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rate would impact our annual interest expense by approximately $1.2 million for the next twelve-month period, which includes the impact of our interest rate caps at a strike rate of 0.75% and the $125 million reduction in the notional amount that will occur on July 31, 2023. Excluding the impact of our interest rate caps, a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rate would impact our annual interest expense by approximately $7.1 million for the next twelve-month period. Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest income generated from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 included amounts in bank deposit accounts, money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. Our cash and cash equivalent accounts as of December 31, 2021 included amounts in bank deposit accounts and money market funds. We believe we have minimal interest rate risk as a 10% decrease in the average interest rate on our portfolio would have reduced interest income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 by immaterial amounts. 52 Inflation: We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. 53 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Gogo Inc. Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Page No. Report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. 34 ) 55 Consolidated Balance Sheets 57 Consolidated Statements of Operations 58 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) 59 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 60 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) 61 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 62 54 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Gogo Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gogo Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Income Taxes — Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets — Refer to Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for tax attributes and are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse. The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance related to deferred income tax assets to determine, based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of such deferred assets will not be realized. The Company’s assessment considers recent financial operating results, the scheduled expiration of its net operating losses, potential sources of taxable income, the reversal of existing taxable differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, if permitted under tax law, and tax planning strategies. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize $162.7 million of its deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2022. We identified management’s determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize deferred income tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments management makes related to taxable income. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates of taxable income. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize deferred income tax assets included the following, among others, which were performed with the assistance of our income tax specialists: 55 /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Chicago,

Background Gogo (“we”, “us,” or “our”) is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. We have served this market for more than 25 years. Our mission is to enrich the lives of passengers and the efficiency of operators with the world’s best business aviation in-flight connectivity and customer support. We have always sought to provide the best connectivity for the business aviation market regardless of technology, and we have a successful history of doing so. Until recently, we focused primarily on business aviation aircraft in North America, which comprise approximately 63% of the worldwide business aviation fleet, and we are the leading provider of in-flight connectivity in that market. Gogo started in analogue air-to-ground (“ATG”) technology in the late 1990s, then, as analogue cellular backhaul disappeared, migrated to narrowband satellite connectivity in the early 2000s, then back to ATG with our digital broadband 3G and 4G networks beginning in 2010. We expect to commercially launch our fourth ATG network – Gogo 5G – in the fourth quarter of 2023. We also continue to provide narrowband satellite services to customers in North America and internationally through distribution agreements with satellite providers. In May 2022, in order to further serve our existing customers and expand our target market, we announced plans to expand our broadband offerings beyond ATG by launching the first global broadband service designed for business aviation (“Global Broadband”). The service will use an electronically steered antenna, specifically designed to address a broad range of business aviation aircraft, operating on a low earth orbit (“LEO”) satellite network. The antenna will be designed with Hughes Network Systems, LLC (“Hughes”) and deployed on a LEO satellite network operated by Network Access Associates Limited (“OneWeb”). On December 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our commercial aviation (“CA”) business to a subsidiary of Intelsat Jackson Holdings S.A. (“Intelsat”) for a purchase price of $ 400.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the “Transaction”). At the closing of the Transaction, the parties entered into certain ancillary agreements, including a transition services agreement, an intellectual property license agreement and commercial agreements. The transition services agreement has been terminated. The commercial agreements include an ATG network sharing agreement with a 10-year term, pursuant to which we provide certain in-flight connectivity services on our current ATG network and, when available, our Gogo 5G network, subject to certain revenue sharing obligations. Under the ATG network sharing agreement, Intelsat has exclusive access to the ATG network for commercial aviation in North America, subject to minimum revenue guarantees. As a result of the Transaction, the CA business is reported in discontinued operations and financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 have been conformed to present the CA business as a discontinued operation. There was no discontinued operations activity for the CA business after December 31, 2021. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. Discontinued operations reporting occurs only when the disposal of a component or a group of components (i) meets the held-for-sale classification criteria or is disposed of by sale or other than by sale, and (ii) represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. Unless otherwise noted, discussion in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refers to our continuing operations. Refer to Note 20, “Discontinued Operations,” for further information. 2 . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated. Prior to the closing of the Transaction, we historically reported our results of operations in three segments: Commercial Aviation-North America (“CA-NA”), Commercial Aviation-Rest of World (“CA-ROW”) and Business Aviation. We managed and reported these businesses separately, as they generally did not share the same customer base, had different products, pricing and expense structures, and measured operating performance and allocated resources on different bases. As a result of the Transaction, we operate in a single distinct business segment, Business Aviation, for which operating performance is measured and resources are allocated on a consolidated basis, consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, our CEO. Therefore, we now report one business segment, comprised of our continuing operations. As we do not have multiple segments, we do not present segment information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the significant estimates and bases 62 such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Significant Risks and Uncertainties - Our operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those associated with fluctuations in operating results, implementation of our technology roadmap, strategic alliances, relationships with customers, suppliers and dealers, supply chain disruptions, funding of our growth, financing terms that may restrict operations, regulatory issues, competition, the economy, te chnology trends, evolving industry standards and other events that may impact the demand for air travel. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments - We consider cash and cash equivalents to be short-term, highly liquid investments that have the following characteristics: readily convertible to known amounts of cash, so near their maturities that there is insignificant risk of changes in value due to any changes in market interest rates, and having maturities of three months or less when purchased. We continually monitor positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which we invest. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets. We consider short-term investments to be investments with maturities of twelve months or less (but greater than three months). Restricted Cash - Certain cash amounts are restricted as to use and are classified outside of cash and cash equivalents. Cash amounts with restrictions of twelve months or less are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and amounts restricted for greater than twelve months are included in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our restricted cash balances were $ 0.3 million and $ 0.4 million , respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , and consisted primarily of a letter of credit issued for the benefit of the landlord of our office location in Chicago, IL. Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. All cash and cash equivalents are invested with creditworthy financial institutions. Our revenue from customers domiciled outside of the United States accounted for less than 10% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Our long-lived assets outside of the United States were less than 10% of our consolidated long-lived assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 . Income Tax - We use an asset- and liability-based approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax attributes and are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets to determine, based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of such deferred assets will not be realized. We also consider the existence of any uncertain tax positions and, as necessary, provide a reserve for any uncertain tax positions at each reporting date. See Note 15, “Income Tax,” for further details. Inventories - Inventories consist primarily of telecommunications systems and parts and are recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. We evaluate the need for write-downs associated with obsolete, slow-moving and nonsalable inventory by reviewing net realizable inventory values on a periodic basis. See Note 5, “Inventories,” for further details. Property and Equipment and Depreciation - Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Network asset inventory and construction in progress, which include materials, transmission and related equipment, interest and other costs relating to the construction and development of our network, are not depreciated until they are put into service. Network equipment consists of switching equipment, antennas, base transceiver stations, site preparation costs, and other related equipment used in the operation of our network. Depreciation expense totaled $ 7.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for owned assets, which are as follows: Office equipment, furniture, fixtures and other 3 - 5 years Leasehold improvements 7 - 13 years Network equipment 5 - 25 years See Note 6, “Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts,” for further details. Improvements to leased property are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease. We reassess the useful lives of leasehold improvements when there are changes to the terms of the underlying lease. Such reassessment has resulted in the useful life of specific assets being adjusted to a shorter period than originally estimated, resulting in an increase in annual depreciation expense for those assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 63 Software Development Costs - We capitalize costs for network and non-network software developed or obtained for internal use during the application development stage. These costs include purchased software and direct costs associated with the development and configuration of internal use software that supports the operation of our service offerings. These costs are included in Intangible assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheets and, when the software is placed in service, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Costs incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. With respect to software sold as part of our equipment sales, we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility has been established. Such capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, based on the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight-line method. Intangible Assets - Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Our FCC Licenses, as defined in Note 8, “Intangible Assets,” are our only material indefinite-lived intangible assets. We perform our annual impairment test of our FCC Licenses during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of impairment. Our qualitative analysis includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environment, industry and market conditions, financial performance versus budget and any other events or circumstances specific to the FCC Licenses. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the FCC Licenses is greater than the carrying value, no further testing is required. If our qualitative analysis indicates more testing is required, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative analysis, we will apply the quantitative impairment test method. Our quantitative impairment testing of the FCC Licenses uses the Greenfield method, an income-based approach. When performing this quantitative impairment testing, we estimate the value of our FCC spectrum licenses by calculating the present value of the cash flows of a hypothetical new market participant whose only assets are such licenses to determine the fair value of the FCC licenses. The estimate takes into account all costs and expenses necessary to build the Company’s infrastructure during the start-up period, projected revenue, and cash flows once the infrastructure is completed. Since there is limited corroborating data available in the marketplace that would demonstrate a market participant’s experience in establishing an “air-to-ground” business, we utilize our historic results and future projections as the underlying basis for the application of the Greenfield method. We follow the traditional discounted cash flow method, calculating the present value of a new market participant’s estimated debt free cash flows, based on our historical weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect the cost of capital for a new market participant. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, projected operating results and cash flows may not always be achieved. The failure to achieve one or more of our assumptions regarding projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term could reduce the estimated fair value below carrying value and result in the recognition of an impairment charge. The results of our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments for 2022, 2021 and 2020 indicated no impairment. Intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are amortized over their useful lives as follows: Software 3 - 8 years OEM and dealer relationships 10 years Service customer relationships 5 - 7 years Other intangible assets 8 years See Note 8, “Intangible Assets,” for further details . Long-Lived Assets - We review our long-lived assets to determine potential impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We do this by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. If we determine an impairment exists, the asset is written down to estimated fair value. There were no impairments of long-lived assets in 2022, 2021 or 2020 . Revenue Recognition - Our revenue is primarily earned from providing connectivity and entertainment services and through sales of equipment. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: 64 Service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services and is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Equipment revenue primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of ATG and narrowband satellite connectivity equipment and is recognized when control of the equipment is transferred to OEMs and dealers, which generally occurs when the equipment is shipped. In all cases, we evaluate whether a contract exists as it relates to collectability of the contract. Once a contract is deemed to exist, we evaluate the transaction price and deliverables under the contract. A limited number of contracts contain multiple equipment and service deliverables. For these contracts, we account for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which is based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer. See Note 4, “Revenue Recognition,” for further information. Research and Development Costs - Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and totaled $ 29.6 million , $ 24.9 million and $ 25.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Research and development costs are reported as engineering, design and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Warranty - We provide warranties on parts and labor related to our products. Our warranty terms range from two to five years. Warranty reserves are established for costs that are estimated to be incurred after the sale, delivery and installation of the products under warranty. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence, and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7, “Composition of Certain Reserves and Allowances,” for the details of the changes in our warranty reserve. Asset Retirement Obligations - We have certain asset retirement obligations related to contractual commitments to remove our network equipment and other assets from leased cell sites upon termination of the site leases. The asset retirement obligations are classified as a noncurrent liability in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6, “Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts,” for the details of the changes in our asset retirement obligations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - We group financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value into three levels of hierarchy based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. See Note 13, “Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities,” for further information. Derivatives - We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate borrowings. We currently use interest rate caps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes, and have designated these interest rate caps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We account for these interest rate caps in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , which requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. We record the effective portion of changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassify these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized. See Note 10, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” for further information. Earnings (Loss) Per Share - We calculate basic earnings (loss) per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. See Note 3, “Earnings (Loss) Per Share,” for further information. Stock-Based Compensation Expense - Compensation cost is measured and recognized at fair value for all stock-based payments, including stock options. For time-based vesting stock options, we estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. For awards with a market condition (which we have used on a limited basis), we estimate fair value using the Monte Carlo Simulation model, which requires assumptions, such as volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life and dividends. Our stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the applicable vesting period and is included in the same operating expense line items in the consolidated statements of operations as the base cash compensation paid to the underlying employees . See Note 14, “Stock-Based Compensation and 401(k) Plan,” for further information. 65 Leases – We account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). We have operating lease agreements for which w e have recorded lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for leases primarily related to cell sites and office buildings. We determine whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception and calculate the lease liability and right-of-use asset using our incremental borrowing rate. Our cell site leases generally have terms of five to ten years , with renewal options for an additional five to 25 years . For certain cell sites, the renewal options are deemed to be reasonably certain to be exercised. Our building leases have original terms of ten years , with renewal options for an additional five years . We recognize operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have finance leases for computer and office equipment. Covenants within the Term Loan Facility contain certain restrictions on our ability to enter into new finance lease arrangements. See Note 16, “Leases,” for further information. Advertising Costs - Costs for advertising are expensed as incurred. Debt Issuance Costs - We defer loan origination fees and financing costs related to our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we defer fees paid directly to the lenders related to amendments of our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. We amortize these costs over the term of the underlying debt obligation using the effective interest method and include them in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The fees incurred but not paid directly to the lenders in connection with amendments are expensed as incurred to interest expense. Deferred financing costs associated with future debt issuances are written off in the period during which we determine that the debt will no longer be issued. See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” for further information. Comprehensive Income (Loss) - Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is net income plus or minus unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments and the changes in fair value of cash flow hedges. Comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 is net loss plus unrealized gains on foreign currency translation adjustments. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting standards adopted: On January 1, 2022, we adopted ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance to increase the transparency of transactions with a government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. ASU 2021-10 requires an entity to disclose information about the nature of the transactions, including the significant terms and conditions, accounting policy used to account for the transactions, and the effect of the transactions on the financial statements. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 3 . Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share have been calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The shares of common stock effectively repurchased in connection with the Forward Transactions (as defined and described in Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities”) are considered participating securities requiring the two-class method to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share. Net earnings will be allocated between shares of common stock and participating securities on a one-to-one basis. In periods of a net loss, the shares associated with the Forward Transactions will not receive an allocation of losses, as the counterparties to the Forward Transactions are not required to fund losses. Additionally, the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 excludes approximately 0.6 million and 2.1 million shares, respectively, associated with the Forward Transactions. The diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations exclude the effect of stock options, deferred stock units, restricted stock units and convertible notes when the computation is anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the weighted average number of shares excluded from the computation was 0.5 million and 5.7 million shares, respectively. As a result of the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, all of the outstanding shares of common stock underlying stock options, deferred stock units, restricted stock units and convertible notes were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding because they were anti-dilutive. 66 During September 2022, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock in a private transaction for an aggregate purchase price of $ 18,345,000 , or $ 12.23 per share (the “Repurchase”). The Repurchase decreased the weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2022. The following tables sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020; however, for the reasons described above, the shares associated with the Forward Transactions are excluded from the computation of basic earnings per share ( in thousands, except per share amounts ): 2022 2021 Income (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Income (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income from continuing operations $ 92,059 $ 156,589 Less: Participation rights on Forward Transactions allocated to continuing operations 171 1,484 Basic Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Undistributed income from continuing operations $ 91,888 123,268 $ 0.75 $ 155,105 103,400 $ 1.50 Effect of Dilutive Securities from Continuing Operations Stock-based compensation — 4,881 — 6,674 2022 Convertible Notes 2,770 5,774 7,221 17,131 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Undistributed income from continuing operations and assumed conversions $ 94,658 133,923 $ 0.71 $ 162,326 127,205 $ 1.28 Net loss from discontinued operations $ — $ ( 3,854 ) Less: Participation rights on Forward Transactions allocated to discontinued operations — ( 36 ) Basic Loss Per Share from Discontinued Operations Undistributed loss from discontinued operations $ — 123,268 $ — $ ( 3,818 ) 103,400 $ ( 0.04 ) Effect of Dilutive Securities from Discontinued Operations Stock-based compensation — 4,881 3,615 6,674 2022 Convertible Notes — 5,774 — 17,131 Diluted Loss Per Share from Discontinued Operations Undistributed loss from discontinued operations and assumed conversions $ — 133,923 $ — $ ( 203 ) 127,205 $ — Earnings per share - basic $ 0.75 $ 1.46 Earnings per share - diluted $ 0.71 $ 1.28 For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Net loss from continuing operations $ ( 48,559 ) Net loss from discontinued operations ( 201,477 ) Net loss ( 250,036 ) Less: Participation rights of the Forward Transactions — Undistributed losses $ ( 250,036 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding-basic and diluted 82,266 Net loss attributable to common stock per share-basic and diluted: Net loss from continuing operations $ ( 0.59 ) Net loss from discontinued operations ( 2.45 ) Net loss $ ( 3.04 ) 67 4. Revenue Recognition Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price in our customer contracts allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations was approximately $ 102 million . We have excluded from this amount consideration from contracts that have an original duration of one year or less. Approximately $ 80 million primarily represents connectivity and entertainment service revenues which are recognized as services are provided, which is expected to occur through the remaining term of the contract. The remaining $ 22 million of such amount represents future equipment revenue that is expected to be recognized primarily within the next two years . Disaggregation of revenue The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by category (in thousands) : For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Service revenue Connectivity $ 291,444 $ 255,786 $ 209,160 Entertainment and other 4,885 3,797 2,827 Total service revenue $ 296,329 $ 259,583 $ 211,987 Equipment revenue ATG $ 91,152 $ 61,780 $ 45,200 Satellite 9,992 11,048 11,746 Other 6,594 3,305 785 Total equipment revenue $ 107,738 $ 76,133 $ 57,731 Customer type Aircraft owner/operator/service provider $ 296,329 $ 259,583 $ 211,987 OEM and aftermarket dealer 107,738 76,133 57,731 Total revenue $ 404,067 $ 335,716 $ 269,718 Contract balances Our current and non-current contract asset balances totaled $ 19.9 million and $ 17.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contract assets represent the aggregate amount of revenue recognized in excess of billings primarily for certain sales programs. Our current and non-current deferred revenue balances totaled $ 3.4 million and $ 1.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Deferred revenue includes, among other things, fees paid for equipment and subscription connectivity products. Major Customers No customer accounted for more than 10 % of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and no customer accounted for more than 10 % of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 or 2021 . 5 . Inventories Inventories consist primarily of telecommunications systems and parts and are recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. We evaluate the need for write-downs associated with obsolete, slow-moving and nonsalable inventory by reviewing net realizable inventory values on a periodic basis. Inventories as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2022 2021 Work-in-process component parts $ 34,840 $ 21,570 Finished goods 14,653 12,406 Total inventory $ 49,493 $ 33,976 68 6. Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts Prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2022 2021 Interest rate caps and receivable $ 28,496 $ 925 Contract assets 6,494 4,533 Prepaid inventories 2,901 2,525 Insurance receivable (1) — 17,300 Tenant improvement allowance receivables — 1,936 Other 7,209 5,076 Total prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 45,100 $ 32,295 Property and equipment as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2022 2021 Office equipment, furniture, fixtures and other $ 17,242 $ 12,759 Leasehold improvements 15,357 13,545 Network equipment 179,363 142,601 211,962 168,905 Accumulated depreciation ( 107,367 ) ( 105,233 ) Property and equipment, net $ 104,595 $ 63,672 Other non-current assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2022 2021 Interest rate caps $ 25,578 $ 11,359 Contract assets, net of allowances of $ 501 and $ 455 , respectively 13,376 13,217 Revolving credit facility deferred financing costs 1,445 1,879 Other 2,956 1,970 Total other non-current assets $ 43,355 $ 28,425 Accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2022 2021 Employee compensation and benefits $ 19,235 $ 13,791 Accrued interest 9,878 6,231 Operating leases 9,094 7,444 Network equipment 8,748 3,179 Warranty reserve 2,300 2,450 Taxes 2,282 1,997 Litigation settlement accrual (1) — 17,300 Other 8,519 7,476 Total accrued liabilities $ 60,056 $ 59,868 Other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consist of the following ( in thousands ): 69 December 31, 2022 2021 Asset retirement obligations $ 6,032 $ 4,861 Other 1,579 2,375 Total other non-current liabilities $ 7,611 $ 7,236 Changes in our non-current asset retirement obligations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 consist of the following ( in thousands ): Asset Retirement Obligation Balance – January 1, 2021 $ 4,401 Liabilities incurred — Liabilities settled — Accretion expense 460 Foreign exchange rate adjustments — Balance – December 31, 2021 4,861 Liabilities incurred 682 Liabilities settled ( 43 ) Accretion expense 553 Foreign exchange rate adjustments ( 21 ) Balance – December 31, 2022 $ 6,032 7 . Composition of Certain Reserves and Allowances Credit Losses — We regularly evaluate our accounts receivable and contract assets for expected credit losses. Our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of each customer’s trade accounts receivables. Due to the short-term nature of such receivables, the estimated amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected is based on the aging of the accounts receivable balances and the financial condition of customers. Additionally, specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. Our monitoring activities include timely account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of each customer’s financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible. We apply a similar methodology to our current and non-current contract asset balances. However, due to the inherent additional risk associated with a long-term receivable, an additional provision for credit loss is applied to contract asset balances that will diminish over time as the contract nears its expiration date. Estimates are used to determine the expected loss allowances. Such allowances are based on management’s assessment of anticipated payment, taking into account available historical and current information as well as management’s assessment of potential future developments. We are continuously monitoring our assumptions used to determine our expected credit losses, including the impact of COVID-19, which could cause us to record additional material credit losses in future periods. Changes in our allowances for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows ( in thousands ): Other Accounts non-current Receivable assets Balance at January 1, 2021 $ 1,044 $ 375 Provision for expected credit losses 204 80 Write-offs charged against the allowances ( 371 ) — Other 17 — Balance at December 31, 2021 894 455 Provision for expected credit losses 1,001 46 Write-offs charged against the allowances ( 326 ) — Other 209 — Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 1,778 $ 501 Warranties — We provide warranties on parts and labor related to our products. Our warranty terms range from two to five years . Warranty reserves are established for costs that are estimated to be incurred after the sale, delivery and installation of the products under warranty. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence, and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 70 Changes in our warranty reserve for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows ( in thousands ): Warranty Reserve Balance – January 1, 2021 $ 2,400 Accruals for warranties issued 126 Settlements and adjustments to warranties ( 76 ) Balance – December 31, 2021 2,450 Accruals for warranties issued 1,583 Settlements and adjustments to warranties ( 1,733 ) Balance – December 31, 2022 $ 2,300 8 . Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are comprised of indefinite- and finite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. We own the rights to 3 MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800 MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (the “3 MHz FCC License”), which is used in the operation of our ATG network, and the license for 1 MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (the “1 MHz FCC License”) acquired as part of our acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC. Together we refer to the 3 MHz FCC License and the 1 MHz FCC License as the “FCC Licenses.” The FCC Licenses were originally issued with 10-year terms and we have renewed both licenses for subsequent 10-year terms. Such licenses are subject to further renewal by the FCC, and renewals of licenses held by others have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that limit the useful life of the FCC Licenses. As a result, the FCC Licenses are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets which we do not amortize. We reevaluate the useful life of the FCC Licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Our annual impairment assessment of the FCC Licenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 indicated no impairment. Our software relates to the development of internal use software which is used to run our network and support our service offerings. Software also includes software embedded in the equipment that we sell to our customers. Our goodwill balance was $ 0.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

On February 2, 2023, Gogo and GIH entered into an amendment to the Original 2021 Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which replaced all references in the Original 2021 Credit Agreement to LIBOR in respect of the applicable interest rates for the Facilities with an adjusted term secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“SOFR”), plus a credit spread adjustment based on the Alternative Reference Rates Committee recommended spread adjustment. The Term Loan Facility amortizes in nominal quarterly installments equal to one percent of the aggregate initial principal amount thereof per annum, with the remaining balance payable upon final maturity of the Term Loan Facility on April 30, 2028 . There are no amortization payments under the Revolving Facility, and all borrowings under the Revolving Facility mature on April 30, 2026 . The Term Loan Facility bears annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH’s option, either (i) an adjusted term SOFR rate (subject to a floor of 0.75 %) plus an applicable margin of 3.75 % and a credit spread adjustment based on the Alternative Reference Rates Committee recommended spread adjustments or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75 %. Loans outstanding under the Revolving Facility bear annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH’s option, either (i) an adjusted term SOFR rate (subject to a floor of 0.00 %) plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.25 % to 3.75 % per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio and a credit spread adjustment based on the Alternative Reference Rates Committee recommended spread adjustments or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25 % to 2.75 % per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. Additionally, unused commitments under the Revolving Facility are subject to a fee ranging from 0.25 % to 0.50 % per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. The Facilities may be prepaid at GIH’s option at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs), subject to minimum principal payment amount requirements. Subject to certain exceptions and de minimis thresholds, the Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to: The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things: incurrence of indebtedness or issuance of disqualified equity interests; incurrence or existence of liens; consolidations or mergers; activities of Gogo and any subsidiary holding a license issued by the Federal Communications Commission; investments, loans, advances, guarantees or acquisitions; asset sales; dividends or 72 other distributions on equity; purchase, redemption or retirement of capital stock; payment or redemption of certain junior indebtedness; entry into other agreements that restrict the ability to incur liens securing the Facilities; and amendment of organizational documents; in each case subject to customary exceptions. The Revolving Facility includes a financial covenant set at a maximum senior secured first lien net leverage ratio of 7.50 :1.00, which will apply if the outstanding amount of loans and unreimbursed letter of credit drawings thereunder at the end of any fiscal quarter exceeds 35 % of the aggregate of all commitments thereunder. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, which, if any of them occurred, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the Facilities to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the Revolving Facility to be terminated. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used, together with cash on hand, (i) to redeem in full and pay the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) together with accrued and unpaid interest and redemption premiums and to pay fees associated with the termination of the ABL Credit Agreement (as defined below and, together with the redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the “Refinancing”), and (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing and the Facilities. The Revolving Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes of GIH and its subsidiaries and was undrawn as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Facility was $ 714.1 million and $ 721.4 million, respectively, the unaccreted debt discount was $ 2.8 million and $ 3.3 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount was $ 711.3 million and $ 718.1 million, respectively. We paid approximately $ 19.7 million of loan origination and financing costs related to the Facilities which are being accounted for as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the terms of the Facilities. Total amortization expense was $ 2.6 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and is included in Interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Facilities was $ 15.3 million and $ 17.9 million, respectively. On April 30, 2021, Gogo, GIH, and each direct and indirect wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiary of GIH (Gogo and such subsidiaries collectively, the “Guarantors”) entered into a guarantee agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) in favor of Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”), whereby GIH and the Guarantors guarantee the obligations under the Facilities and certain other secured obligations as set forth in the Guarantee Agreement, and GIH and the Guarantors entered into a collateral agreement (the “Collateral Agreement”), in favor of the Collateral Agent, whereby GIH and the Guarantors grant a security interest in substantially all of their respective tangible and intangible assets (including the equity interests in each direct material wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiary owned by GIH or any Guarantor, and 65% of the equity interests in any non-U.S. subsidiary held directly by GIH or any Guarantor), subject to certain exceptions, to secure the obligations under the Facilities and certain other secured obligations as set forth in the Collateral Agreement. 2022 Convertible Notes On November 21, 2018, we issued $ 215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $ 32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $ 22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $ 237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. In January 2021, $ 1.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes was converted by holders and settled through the issuance of 166,666 shares of common stock. On March 17, 2021, Gogo entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements (the “March 2021 Exchange Agreements”) with certain holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes. Pursuant to the March 2021 Exchange Agreements, such holders exchanged a total of $ 28,235,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes for 5,121,811 shares of our common stock on March 24, 2021. The negotiated exchange rate under the March 2021 Exchange Agreements was 181.40 shares of common stock per $ 1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on settlement of $ 4.4 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. On April 1, 2021, Gogo entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement (the “GTCR Exchange Agreement”) with an affiliate of funds managed by GTCR LLC (“GTCR”). Pursuant to the GTCR Exchange Agreement, GTCR exchanged $ 105,726,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes for 19,064,529 shares of our common stock on April 9, 2021. The negotiated exchange rate under the GTCR Exchange Agreement was 180.32 shares of common stock per $ 1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on settlement of $ 14.6 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. 73 As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was $ 102.8 million and was classified as Current portion of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. In May 2022, the remaining $ 102,788,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes was converted by holders into 17,131,332 shares of common stock. Thorndale Farm Private Equity Fund 2, LLC, an entity affiliated with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, held $ 8,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes that was converted into 1,333,333 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes. We incurred approximately $ 8.1 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes that were amortized over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $ 0.4 million, $ 1.4 million and $ 1.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Amortization expense is included in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2021, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2022 Convertible Notes was $ 0.4 million and was included as a reduction to the carrying amount of the debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11, “Interest Costs,” for additional information. The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 shares of common stock per $ 1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 6.00 per share of our common stock. Prior to conversion, the shares of common stock subject to conversion were considered in the diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method if their impact was dilutive. Forward Transactions In connection with the issuance of our 3.75 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Convertible Notes”), we paid approximately $ 140.0 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the “Forward Transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “Forward Counterparties”), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to one of the Forward Transactions (the “Amended and Restated Forward Transaction”) to extend the expected settlement date with respect to approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock held by one of the Forward Counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the “2022 Forward Counterparty”), to correspond with the May 15, 2022 maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders’ equity within our consolidated balance sheets was reduced by approximately $ 140.0 million. In March, 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. In April 2021, approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. In May 2022, the approximately 0.6 million shares that were remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transactions were delivered to us. As of December 31, 2022, there were no prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions outstanding. 2024 Senior Secured Notes On April 25, 2019, GIH and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo Finance” and, together with GIH, the “Issuers”) issued $ 905.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875 % senior secured notes due 2024 (the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”), at a price equal to 99.512 % of their face value, under an indenture, dated as of April 25, 2019, among the Issuers, Gogo, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. On May 7, 2019, the Issuers issued an additional $ 20.0 million of 2024 Senior Secured notes, which were issued at a price equal to 100.5 % of their face value, and $ 50.0 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes on November 13, 2020, which were issued at a price equal to 103.5 % of their face value. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Gogo and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Gogo Finance), subject to certain exceptions. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees were secured by certain liens on the Company’s collateral, which were released upon the closing of the Transaction. We paid approximately $ 22.6 million of origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, which were accounted for as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheets and were being amortized over the contractual term of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $ 1.4 million and $ 3.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Amortization expense is included in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 74 The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were redeemed on May 1, 2021 (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price equal to 104.938 % of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the Redemption Date. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $ 48.1 million. We wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $ 15.2 million and the remaining debt discount of $ 1.3 million, which together are included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. ABL Credit Facility On August 26, 2019, Gogo, GIH and Gogo Finance entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent, which provided for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”) of up to $ 30.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. The obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement were guaranteed by Gogo and all of its existing and future subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and secured by collateral of the Company. On April 30, 2021, the ABL Credit Agreement and all commitments thereunder were terminated. As a result of the termination, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $ 0.3 million were written off as of May 1, 2021 and included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. 2020 Convertible Notes In March 2015, we issued $ 361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. In 2018 and 2019, we repurchased a total of $ 359.4 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes, and on March 1, 2020, the remaining $ 2.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes matured. 10. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate borrowings. We currently use interest rate caps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes, and have designated these interest rate caps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the earnings impact of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded upon the recognition of the variable interest payments related to the hedged debt. In May 2021, we purchased interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 650.0 million for $ 8.6 million. The cost of the interest rate caps will be amortized to interest expense using the caplet method, from the effective date through termination date. We receive payments in the amount calculated pursuant to the caps for any period in which the three-month USD LIBOR rate increases beyond the applicable strike rate . The notional amounts of the interest rate caps periodically decrease over the life of the caps. The notional amounts, strike rates and end dates of the cap agreements are as follows (notional amounts in thousands) : Start Date End Date Notional Amounts Strike Rate 7/31/2021 7/31/2023 $ 650,000 0.75 % 7/31/2023 7/31/2024 525,000 0.75 % 7/31/2024 7/31/2025 350,000 1.25 % 7/31/2025 7/31/2026 250,000 2.25 % 7/31/2026 7/31/2027 200,000 2.75 % We record the effective portion of changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassify these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized. The amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense in the event the hedges are no longer considered effective, in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . No gains or losses of our cash flow hedges were considered to be ineffective and reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 . We estimate that approximately $ 1.5 million currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months. We assess the effectiveness of the hedge on an ongoing basis. Cash flows from interest rate caps are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flows as investing activities from continuing operations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an unrealized gain on the interest rate caps of $ 28.4 million, net of tax of $ 9.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an unrealized gain on the interest rate caps of $ 2.7 million, net of tax of $ 0.9 million. Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate caps exclude amortization of the purchase price paid for the interest rate caps. 75 When derivatives are used, we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties; however, non-performance is not anticipated. ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values of the interest rate derivatives are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments from commercial banks (based on significant observable inputs - Level 2 inputs). The following table presents the fair value of our interest rate derivatives included in the consolidated balance sheets for the periods presented (in thousands): December 31, Derivatives designated as hedging instruments Balance sheet location 2022 2021 Current portion of interest rate caps Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 24,459 $ 92 5 Non-current portion of interest rate caps Other non-current assets $ 25,578 $ 11,359 Fair Value Measurement Our derivative assets and liabilities consist principally of interest rate caps, which are carried at fair value based on significant observable inputs (Level 2 inputs). Derivatives entered into by us are typically executed over-the-counter and are valued using discounted cash flows along with fair value models that primarily use market observable inputs. These models take into account a variety of factors including, where applicable, maturity, interest rate yield curves, and counterparty credit risks. 11. Interest Costs We capitalize a portion of our interest on funds borrowed during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The following is a summary of our interest costs for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Interest costs charged to expense $ 43,530 $ 62,390 $ 105,988 Amortization of deferred financing costs 3,058 4,661 5,892 Accretion of debt discount 456 419 13,907 Amortization of the purchase price of interest rate caps 157 2 — Interest rate cap benefit ( 8,329 ) — — Interest expense 38,872 67,472 125,787 Interest costs capitalized to property and equipment 920 4 — Interest costs capitalized to software 472 311 885 Total interest costs $ 40,264 $ 67,787 $ 126,672 12. Common Stock and Preferred Stock Common Stock – We have one class of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our common stock is junior to our preferred stock, if and when issued. Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes a total of 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $ 0.0001 per share. Preferred Stock – Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 100,000,000 shares of new preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.01 per share. No shares of this new preferred stock have been issued. The preferred stock may be issued, from time to time, in one or more series as authorized by the Board of Directors, which has the authority to designate the terms of any series of preferred stock issued, including, without limitation, the number of shares to be included in such series of preferred stock, any dividend, redemption, conversion rights or voting powers and the designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights. Shareholder Rights Plan – On September 23, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 Rights Agreement (as amended, the “Rights Agreement”), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent (the “Rights Agent”), and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, outstanding on the record date of October 2, 2020, to the stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Preferred Shares”) at a price of $ 38.40 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right, subject to adjustment. In December 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Rights Agreement with the Rights Agent, which, among other things, changed the Distribution Date (as defined below) from the close of business on the tenth to the thirtieth day after the Stock Acquisition Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement), with certain exceptions. 76 The purpose of the Rights Agreement is to facilitate the Company’s ability to preserve its net operating losses (“NOLs”) and certain other tax attributes in order to be able to offset potential future income taxes for federal income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOLs and other tax attributes would be substantially limited if it experiences an “ownership change,” as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). A company generally experiences an ownership change if the percentage of the value of its stock owned by certain “5-percent shareholders,” as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. The Rights Agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code by deterring any person or group from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the shares of the Company’s common stock then-outstanding. The Rights are attached to all shares of the Company’s common stock, and until the Distribution Date (as defined below), the Rights will be transferred with and only with the common stock. As long as the Rights are attached to the common stock, the Company will issue one Right with each new share of common stock so that all such shares of common stock will have Rights attached (subject to certain limited exceptions). The Rights will separate and begin trading separately from the common stock, and Right certificates will be caused to evidence the Rights, on the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the thirtieth day following public disclosure of facts indicating that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the outstanding common stock (an “Acquiring Person”) (or, in the event the Board of Directors determines to effect an exchange in accordance with Section 24 of the Rights Agreement and the Board of Directors determines that a later date is advisable, then such later date) and (ii) the close of business on the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 4.9% or more of the outstanding common stock (the earlier of such dates, the “Distribution Date”). The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the Board of Directors determines in its sole discretion that (x) the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of material valuable NOLs or tax attributes or (y) the NOLs and tax attributes have been fully utilized and may no longer be carried forward and (ii) the close of business on September 23, 2023. The Rights Agreement was approved by the Company's stockholders at the Company's 2021 annual meeting of stockholders. On September 15, 2022, pursuant to the Rights Agreement and following approval by the Board of Directors, the Company requested that BlackRock, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and funds under management, “BlackRock”), as promptly as practicable, divest sufficient shares of the Company’s common stock to take BlackRock’s beneficial ownership below 4.9% so as to not be deemed an “Acquiring Person” under the Rights Agreement. On September 28, 2022, following confirmation that it had divested sufficient shares of the Company’s common stock so as to not be deemed an “Acquiring Person” under the Rights Agreement, the Board of Directors granted a request by BlackRock that it be deemed an “Exempt Person” under the Rights Agreement, subject to BlackRock satisfying certain ownership conditions, including that neither BlackRock, Inc. nor any subsidiary or individual fund will have an economic interest of 4.9% or more of the Company’s common stock. Additionally, on December 29, 2022, the Board of Directors determined another shareholder not to be deemed an “Acquiring Person” under the Rights Agreement and granted a request from the shareholder that it be deemed an “Exempt Person” under the Rights Agreement, subject to such shareholder satisfying certain ownership conditions. 13. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Refer to Note 10, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” for fair value information relating to our interest rate caps. Long-Term Debt: As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our financial assets and liabilities that are disclosed but not measured at fair value include the Term Loan Facility, and solely as of December 31, 2021, the 2022 Convertible Notes, which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets at cost. The fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since they are based on quoted market prices of our instruments in markets that are not active. We estimated the fair value of the Term Loan Facility, and 77 solely as of December 31, 2021, the 2022 Convertible Notes, by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume these obligations. The upfront cash payments used in the calculations of fair value on our consolidated balance sheets, excluding any issuance costs, are the amount that a market participant would be willing to lend at such date to an entity with a credit rating similar to ours and that would allow such an entity to achieve sufficient cash inflows to cover the scheduled cash outflows under the Term Loan Facility, and solely as of December 31, 2021, the 2022 Convertible Notes. The fair value and carrying value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in thousands) : December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Fair Value (1) Carrying Value Fair Value (1) Carrying Value Term Loan Facility $ 708,000 $ 711,263 (2) $ 723,000 $ 718,057 (2) 2022 Convertible Notes $ — $ — $ 230,000 $ 102,788 14. Stock-Based Compensation and 401(k) Plan As of December 31, 2022 , we maintained three stock-based incentive compensation plans: the Second Amended and Restated Gogo Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Omnibus Plan”), the Gogo Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2013 Omnibus Plan”), and The Aircell Holdings Inc. Stock Option Plan, collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans,” as well as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), as discussed below. Our Stock Plans provide for the grant of both equity and cash awards, including non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards (shares and units), restricted stock, RSUs, deferred share units (“DSUs”) and other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents to eligible employees, directors and consultants, as determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”). Under the Stock Plans, 33,234,128 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. As of December 31, 2022 , 6,941,586 shares remained available for grant under our Stock Plans. The contractual life of granted options is 10 years . Except as otherwise approved by the Compensation Committee, all options that are unvested as of the date on which a recipient’s employment terminates, as well as vested options that are not exercised within a prescribed period following termination, are forfeited and become available for future grants. Options granted beginning in 2010 but prior to the Option Exchange (as defined below) include options that (a) vest in specified increments over a four-year period, (b) vest on the date of grant for certain options granted to non-employee members of our Board of Directors or (c) vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant for certain options granted to non-employee members of our Board of Directors. In June 2020, we consummated an option exchange program that was approved by our stockholders at the annual meeting held on April 29, 2020 in which previously outstanding eligible options (which excluded options granted for service by non-executive members of our Board of Directors) to purchase 6,664,773 shares of common stock were surrendered and cancelled and we granted replacement options (the “Replacement Options”) in exchange for the tendered options. Of the 4,168,455 options we granted in 2020, 2,896,383 w ere Replacement Options. The Replacement Options vested in a single installment on December 31, 2022. Beginning in 2013, we granted RSUs, which generally vest in equal annual increments over a four-year period. Vested RSUs will be settled, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, in shares of our common stock or in cash equal to the value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock on the vesting date. We also granted DSUs to directors, some of which vest on the grant date and others on the first anniversary of the grant date. DSUs will be settled in shares of our common stock 90 days after the director ceases to serve as a director. We intend to settle RSU and DSU awards in stock and we have the shares available to do so. The following is a summary of our stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations, excluding the stock-based compensation expense for discontinued operations, for the years December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Cost of service revenue $ 1,073 $ 472 $ 119 Cost of equipment revenue 1,022 523 235 Engineering, design and development 2,532 1,358 560 Sales and marketing 2,628 1,615 880 General and administrative 11,810 9,377 6,014 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 19,065 $ 13,345 $ 7,808 78 A summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Options outstanding – January 1, 2022 4,802,342 $ 4.18 6.57 $ 45,927 Granted — $ — Exercised ( 758,681 ) $ 2.67 Forfeited — $ — Expired ( 30,900 ) $ 17.78 Options outstanding – December 31, 2022 4,012,761 $ 4.36 5.38 $ 42,396 Options exercisable – December 31, 2022 3,708,974 $ 4.51 5.32 $ 38,696 As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options were approximately $ 0.4 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1 year. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $ 18 million , $ 10 million and $ 16 million, respectively. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. No stock options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2022. Weighted average assumptions used and weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Approximate risk-free interest rate 1.0 % 0.5 % Average expected life (years) 5.50 6.20 Dividend yield N/A N/A Volatility 77.0 % 66.8 % Weighted average grant date fair value of common stock underlying options granted $ 9.66 $ 2.59 Weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted $ 6.22 $ 1.56 The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the term that mirrored the expected term in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of our stock options was determined based upon a simplified assumption that the stock options will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life. The dividend yield was based on expected dividends at the time of grant. Beginning in 2020, we calculated volatility based exclusively on our common stock. The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs and DSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022: Number of Underlying Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested – January 1, 2022 3,998,688 $ 7.40 Granted 1,513,287 $ 17.21 Vested ( 1,897,299 ) $ 6.50 Forfeited/canceled ( 148,451 ) $ 10.32 Unvested – December 31, 2022 3,466,225 $ 12.46 As of December 31, 2022, there was approximately $ 30 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years. The total grant date fair value of RSUs and DSUs vested in 2022 was approximately $ 12 million . ESPP - In June 2013, the Board of Directors and stockholders approved the ESPP, which became effective on June 26, 2013, and in 2017 and 2020, the ESPP was amended to increase the number of shares reserved thereunder. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of common stock during pre-specified offering periods at a discount established by the Compensation Committee which may not exceed 15 % of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period (whichever is lower). Under the ESPP, 2,200,000 shares were reserved for issuance and 52,489 shares of common stock were issued during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022 , 714,091 shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP. 401(k) Plan - Under our 401(k) plan, all employees who are eligible to participate are entitled to make tax-deferred contributions, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. We match 100 % of the employee’s first 4 % of contributions made, subject to annual 79 limitations. Our matching contributions were $ 2.1 million , $ 1.8 million, and $ 1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. 15. Income Tax For financial reporting purposes, the income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes included the following components for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 United States $ 105,450 $ ( 27,557 ) $ ( 45,840 ) Foreign 267 ( 3,084 ) ( 2,865 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ 105,717 $ ( 30,641 ) $ ( 48,705 ) Significant components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 are as follows ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Current: Federal $ — $ — $ — State 488 90 86 Foreign — — — 488 90 86 Deferred: Federal 11,830 ( 166,706 ) ( 318 ) State 2,464 ( 20,614 ) 86 Foreign ( 1,124 ) — — 13,170 ( 187,320 ) ( 232 ) Total $ 13,658 $ ( 187,230 ) $ ( 146 ) The provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations differs from income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 as a result of the following items: For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Effect of: Change in valuation allowance ( 10.9 ) 595.5 ( 48.9 ) State income taxes-net of federal tax benefit 4.0 3.2 14.0 R&D credit ( 0.4 ) 8.3 — Excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation ( 2.0 ) ( 3.0 ) 1.2 Loss on settlement of 2022 Convertible Notes — ( 12.9 ) — Other 1.2 ( 1.1 ) 13.0 Effective tax rate 12.9 % 611.0 % 0.3 % 80 Components of the net deferred income tax asset as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Deferred income tax assets: Compensation accruals $ 2,912 $ 2,492 Stock options 8,483 7,839 Inventory 990 823 Warranty reserves 565 609 Fixed assets 6,438 5,821 Capital loss 10,425 10,425 Deferred revenue 18 184 Federal net operating loss (NOL) 118,043 144,591 State NOL 26,033 29,690 Foreign NOL 14,430 15,478 Interest carryforward 67,644 71,778 UNICAP adjustment 4,739 1,070 Finite-lived intangible assets 3,334 3,374 Operating lease liability 21,744 21,118 R&D credit 3,005 2,538 Section 174 costs 4,624 — Other 4,802 4,983 Total deferred income tax assets 298,229 322,813 Deferred income tax liabilities: Indefinite-lived intangible assets ( 9,138 ) ( 8,043 ) Right-of-use asset ( 18,525 ) ( 17,684 ) Interest rate cap valuation ( 10,213 ) ( 909 ) Other ( 226 ) ( 324 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities ( 38,102 ) ( 26,960 ) Total deferred income tax 260,127 295,853 Valuation allowance ( 97,470 ) ( 110,720 ) Net deferred income tax asset $ 162,657 $ 185,133 We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets to determine, based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of such deferred assets will not be realized. In our assessments, the Company considers recent financial operating results, the scheduled expiration of our net operating losses, potential sources of taxable income, the reversal of existing taxable differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, if permitted under tax law, and tax planning strategies. Based on our most recent assessment, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we released $ 11.4 million of the valuation allowance for the portion of our deferred income tax assets that we are more likely than not going to utilize. As of December 31, 2022, we can demonstrate an estimate of objectively verifiable future income based on the prior three years of pre-tax income from continuing operations, adjusted for the change in interest expense resulting from the Refinancing and the settlement of the 2022 Convertible Notes. This estimate of future income, along with our assessment of the other positive and negative evidence considered, supports the release of a portion of the valuation allowance. The remaining valuation allowance is still required for deferred tax assets related to certain state and foreign NOLs, capital losses, and the Section 163(j) interest limitation carryforward as it was more likely than not as of December 31, 2022 that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we continue to sustain our current operating performance, additional reversals of our valuation allowance could occur within the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2022, the federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward amount was approximately $ 562 million, the state NOL carryforward amount was approximately $ 448 million and the Section 163(j) interest limitation carryforward amount was $292 million. The federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2032. The state NOLs expire in various tax years beginning in 2023. The interest carryforward does not expire. As of December 31, 2022 , the Canadian NOL carryforward amount was approximately $ 54 million, and it will begin to expire in 2032. Utilization of our NOL, interest and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The interest carryforward arises from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and generally limits the interest expense deduction to 30 % of income (loss) attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization for tax years 2018 to 2021 and 30 % of income (loss) attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income and income taxes for 2022 and subsequent years. The interest carryforward will not expire as it may be carried forward indefinitely. 81 Uncertain Tax Positions - As of December 31, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 0.8 million, which, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2021 , we did no t have any gross unrecognized tax benefits. The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows (in thousands) : For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Beginning balances $ — Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 555 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year — Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 244 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities — Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations — Ending balances $ 799 We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and many states and Canada. With few exceptions, as of December 31, 2022, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019. We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision line item in the consolidated statement of operations. No penalties or interest related to uncertain tax positions were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , we did no t have a liability recorded for interest or potential penalties. We do no t expect a change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. 16. Leases The following is a summary of our lease expense included in the consolidated statement of operations (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 14,964 $ 13,203 $ 11,688 Finance lease cost: Amortization of leased assets 156 35 230 Interest on lease liabilities 40 50 113 Total lease cost $ 15,160 $ 13,288 $ 12,031 Other information regarding our leases is as follows (in thousands, except lease terms and discount rates) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Supplemental cash flow information Cash paid for amounts included in measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows used in operating leases $ 15,194 $ 13,930 $ 12,733 Operating cash flows used in finance leases $ 40 $ 51 $ 113 Financing cash flows used in finance leases $ 184 $ 145 $ 546 Non-cash items: Operating leases obtained $ 13,547 $ 43,148 $ 5,342 Finance leases obtained $ 11 $ — $ 428 Weighted average remaining lease term Operating leases 8 years 9 years 7 years Finance leases 1 year 2 years 2 years Weighted average discount rate Operating leases 6.7 % 7.0 % 11.2 % Finance leases 17.0 % 18.6 % 10.5 % 82 Annual future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands) : Years ending December 31, Operating Leases Financing Leases 2023 $ 14,499 $ 141 2024 15,087 4 2025 14,227 2 2026 14,048 — 2027 13,191 — Thereafter 42,630 — Total future minimum lease payments 113,682 147 Less: Amount representing interest ( 25,347 ) ( 9 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments $ 88,335 $ 138 Reported as of December 31, 2022 Accrued liabilities $ 9,094 $ 133 Non-current operating lease liabilities 79,241 — Other non-current liabilities — 5 Total lease liabilities $ 88,335 $ 138 As of December 31, 2022 , there were no significant leases which had not yet commenced. 17. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Commitments – We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase hardware components and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the hardware components or as development services are provided. In June 2022, we and Hughes entered into a supply and product support agreement (the “SPSA”), providing for our purchase from Hughes of airborne antennas for use on a LEO satellite network, and the performance by Hughes of services related thereto. Under the SPSA, we commit to purchase, over a seven-year period that will begin on completion of a project milestone currently expected to occur at the end of 2024, antennas with an estimated aggregate purchase price of approximately $ 170 million. During that seven-year period, Hughes may not sell substantially similar equipment to other purchasers in our primary target market. Indemnifications and Guarantees – In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of the performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. Securities Litigation – On June 27, 2018 , a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the “Court”) styled Pierrelouis v. Gogo Inc., naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, its current Chief Financial Officer and its then-current President, Commercial Aviation, as defendants purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our securities from February 27, 2017 through May 4, 2018. The complaint asserted claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, alleging misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to the reliability of and installation and remediation costs associated with CA’s 2Ku antenna. The plaintiffs sought to recover from us and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages. In December 2018, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and in February 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss such amended complaint. In October 2019, the judge granted the motion to dismiss on two independent grounds, finding that the plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that the defendants made materially false or misleading statements and that the plaintiffs failed to plead with particularity that the defendants acted with scienter. The amended complaint was dismissed without prejudice, and in December 2019, the defendants filed a second amended complaint. In July 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting leave to file a proposed third amended complaint, which was granted by the Court. The plaintiffs proceeded to file the third amended complaint in July 2020 and we filed a motion to dismiss in September 2020. In April 2021, the Court denied our motion to dismiss, and the defendants filed their answer and affirmative defenses to the third amended complaint in June 2021. 83 The parties engaged in mediation and reached a tentative resolution that included a cash payment of $ 17.3 million (funded by our Directors’ and Officers’ (“D&O”) insurance policy) in exchange for a dismissal with prejudice of the class claims and full releases. As a result of this development, the Company accrued a $ 17.3 million liability within Accrued liabilities and a corresponding insurance receivable in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021. On April 12, 2022, the parties entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement memorializing these terms (the “Class Action Settlement”). On May 3, 2022, the Court signed an order (i) preliminarily approving the Class Action Settlement; (ii) certifying the settlement class; (iii) approving the notice to be sent to members of the settlement class; and (iv) scheduling a final hearing for August 30, 2022, and the insurance carriers subsequently deposited the settlement amount into escrow. On August 31, 2022, the Court issued a final judgment approving the Class Action Settlement and dismissing all claims against the defendants with prejudice. The Company released the $ 17.3 million liability and corresponding insurance receivable after the Court approved the Class Action Settlement. Derivative Litigation – On September 25, 2018 and September 26, 2018 , two purported stockholders of the Company filed substantively identical derivative lawsuits in the Court, styled Nanduri v. Gogo Inc. and Hutsenpiller v. Gogo Inc., respectively. Both lawsuits were purportedly brought derivatively on behalf of us and name us as a nominal defendant and name as defendants each then-current member of the Company’s Board of Directors, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, its then-current President, Commercial Aviation, and its current Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and allege misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to the 2Ku antenna’s reliability and installation and remediation costs, as well as allegedly excessive bonuses, stock options, and other compensation paid to current officers and directors and excessive severance paid to former officers. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on our behalf, an unspecified amount of damages from the individual defendants. The two lawsuits were consolidated and were stayed pending a final disposition of the motion to dismiss in the class action suit and remain stayed. In addition, a purported stockholder has sent a letter to the Company’s Board of Directors, dated June 21, 2021, demanding based on substantially the same allegations, that the Company sue certain current and former Officers for, inter alia , breach of fiduciary duty. The two derivative lawsuits and the litigation demand letter are collectively referred to herein as the “Derivative Matters” and the plaintiffs in the two derivative lawsuits and the purported stockholder who sent the litigation demand letter are collectively referred to herein as the “Stockholders.” On January 5, 2023, following mediation, the defendants and the Stockholders entered into Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the “Derivative Settlement”) under which the Company, in consideration of dismissal of the two derivative lawsuits with prejudice and a release of all claims asserted against the Company and the individual defendants in the Derivative Matters, will implement certain corporate governance initiatives and cause its D&O insurance carrier to pay the Stockholders’ attorneys’ fees. Under the terms of the Derivative Settlement, the defendants will not be required to pay any damages. We have accrued a liability for attorneys’ fees within Accrued liabilities and a corresponding receivable in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. On February 1, 2023, the Court granted preliminary approval of the proposed Derivative Settlement, approved various notices to be disseminated to the Company’s stockholders and the schedule for dissemination, and scheduled a final hearing for April 11, 2023. The Derivative Settlement is conditioned on final Court approval. We believe that the claims are without merit and will continue to defend them vigorously should the Derivative Settlement for any reason not become final. SmartSky Litigation – On February 28, 2022 , SmartSky Networks, LLC brought suit against Gogo Inc. and its subsidiary Gogo Business Aviation LLC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Gogo 5G infringes four patents owned by the plaintiff. On February 21, 2023, the plaintiff amended its complaint to allege that Gogo 5G infringes two additional patents recently issued to the plaintiff. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages as well as treble damages for alleged willful infringement and reimbursement of plaintiff's costs, disbursements and attorneys' fees. Under a schedule agreed upon by the parties, fact discovery and claim construction proceedings will be substantially completed by the end of 2023 or early 2024, and expert discovery by early-to-mid 2024, with dispositive motions to follow. A trial date has been scheduled for April 14, 2025. Also on February 28, 2022, the plaintiff filed a motion (the “PI Motion”) requesting that the Court preliminarily enjoin the Company from making, using, offering to sell or selling the Gogo 5G system. On September 26, 2022, the Court issued an order denying the PI Motion. The plaintiff has appealed the denial to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We expect that briefing for the appeal will be completed by early March of 2023, after which the appellate court will schedule oral argument. We believe that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit and intend to continue to vigorously defend our position in the infringement suit and defend against the appeal. The outcomes of the appeal and the underlying litigation are inherently uncertain. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material adverse impact on our company due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted, which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as damages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs. 84 18.

Discontinued Operations As discussed in Note 1, “Background,” on December 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our CA business to Intelsat. As a result of the Transaction, the CA business is reported for all periods as discontinued operations. The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations which are presented as Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in our consolidated statements of operations (in thousands) : 87 For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Revenue: Service revenue $ — $ — $ 192,616 Equipment revenue — — 40,483 Total revenue — — 233,099 Operating expenses: Cost of service revenue (exclusive of items shown below) — — 145,958 Cost of equipment revenue (exclusive of items shown below) — — 33,978 Engineering, design and development — — 57,167 Sales and marketing — — 24,121 General and administrative — 6,283 40,551 Impairment of long-lived assets — — 47,375 Depreciation and amortization — — 119,827 Total operating expenses — 6,283 468,977 Operating loss — ( 6,283 ) ( 235,878 ) Other (income) expense: Gain on sale of CA business — ( 1,598 ) ( 37,958 ) Other (income) expense — — 3,134 Total other (income) expense: — ( 1,598 ) ( 34,824 ) Loss before income taxes — ( 4,685 ) ( 201,054 ) Income tax provision (benefit) — ( 831 ) 423 Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ — $ ( 3,854 ) $ ( 201,477 ) The following discussion relates entirely to discontinued operations. Gain on Sale – Upon the closing of the Transaction on December 1, 2020, we received initial gross proceeds of $ 386.3 million, which reflects the $ 400.0 million purchase price, adjusted for cash, debt, transaction expenses and working capital. The final purchase price was subject to change due to customary post-closing purchase price adjustment procedures set forth in the purchase and sale agreement between Gogo and Intelsat, that were not yet complete. As the post-closing purchase price adjustment was not yet finalized and therefore represented a contingent gain, $ 9.4 million was recorded as a deferred gain on sale included within Accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2020. During December 2020, we recognized within Gain on sale of CA business a pretax gain on sale of $ 38.0 million, computed as the $ 386.3 million of initial gross proceeds less (i) the potential $ 9.4 million post-closing purchase price adjustment not yet finalized, (ii) the carrying value of the assets and liabilities transferred in the Transaction and (iii) Transaction-related costs. In October 2021, the independent accounting firm engaged to resolve a dispute between the parties regarding the working capital matter determined the final amount of the working capital adjustments to be $ 7.8 million. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Gogo paid Intelsat the $ 7.8 million and recognized an additional Gain on sale of CA business of $ 1.6 million. Stock-Based Compensation – In August 2020, the Compensation Committee approved modifications to the vesting conditions and exercise periods of outstanding equity compensation awards held by certain of our then-current employees who became employees of Intelsat in the Transaction. These modifications became effective upon the consummation of the Transaction. Pursuant to such modifications, the options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) held by Intelsat employees generally vested on the earlier of (i) the original vesting date and (ii) December 1, 2021; provided that the employee did not voluntarily resign from and was not terminated for cause by Intelsat prior to such date. Certain of these awards vested based on conditions that are not classified as a service, market or performance condition and as a result such awards were classified as a liability. Other than mark-to-market adjustments, a ll costs related to stock-based compensation for our prior employees who became employees of Intelsat in the Transaction were recognized as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, $ 24.0 million was reclassified from Accrued liabilities to Additional paid-in capital as the awards vested during the period. As of December 31, 2021, there were no remaining liability-classified awards. The following is a summary of our stock-based compensation expense by operating expense line contained within the results of discontinued operations for the years December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands) : 2022 2021 2020 Cost of service revenue $ — $ — $ 7,647 Cost of equipment revenue — — — Engineering, design and development — — 5,836 Sales and marketing — — 7,911 General and administrative — 4,817 4,413 Total stock-based compensation expense $ — $ 4,817 $ 25,807 See Note 14, “Stock-Based Compensation and 401(k) Plan,” for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans. 88 Other Costs Classified to Discontinued Operations – During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $ 1.5 million of additional costs (exclusive of the gain on sale, stock-based compensation expense noted above and income tax benefit) primarily due to employer-paid taxes arising from the exercise of stock options by former employees then employed by Intelsat. Change in Estimates – During the second quarter of 2020, our agreement with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) to provide 2Ku service on certain Delta aircraft was amended to change the contract expiration date from February 2027 with respect to all aircraft to a staggered, fleet by fleet expiration schedule under which expiration dates will occur between November 2020 and July 2022 (the “Delta amendment”). As a result, the useful lives of the equipment installed on these fleets were shortened to align with the expiration dates in the amended agreement. The change in estimated useful lives resulted in approximately $ 41.0 million of accelerated depreciation during the year ended December 31, 2020. We ceased depreciating these assets and other depreciable assets included as part of discontinued operations when the CA business was classified as held for sale. Additionally, the amortization periods for the remaining deferred airborne lease incentives associated with the equipment installed on the 2Ku fleets were shortened to align with the new expiration dates, which resulted in approximately $ 42.0 million of accelerated amortization during the year ended December 31, 2020. Amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives is a reduction to cost of service revenue. Credit Losses – During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $ 10.7 million of provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to one international airline partner entering bankruptcy administration, while we had recoveries of approximately $ 0.6 million. Arrangements with Commercial Airlines – For our divested CA business, pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we placed our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines in order to deliver our service to passengers on the aircraft. We had two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. Under the airline-directed model, we transferred control of the equipment to the airline and therefore the airline was our customer in these transactions. Under the turnkey model, we had not transferred control of our equipment to our airline partner and, as a result, the airline passenger was deemed to be our customer. Transactions with our airline partners under the turnkey model were accounted for as an operating lease of space on an aircraft. We recognized $ 71.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a reduction to our cost of service revenue from the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives. Under the turnkey model, the revenue share paid to our airline partners represented operating lease payments. These payments were deemed to be contingent rental payments as the payments due to each airline were based on a percentage of our CA service revenue generated from that airline’s passengers, which was unknown until realized. Therefore, we estimated the lease payments due to an airline at the commencement of our contract with such airline. This rental expense is included in cost of service revenue and is partially offset by the amortization of the deferred airborne lease incentives discussed above. Due to the accelerated amortization resulting from the Delta amendment and a significant reduction in revenue share as a result of COVID-19, the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives exceeded our revenue share expense by $ 49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Asset Impairment – We reviewed our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and other non-current assets, for potential impairment whenever events indicated that the carrying amount of such assets might not be recoverable. We performed this review by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. We grouped certain long-lived assets by airline contract and by technology. If we determined that an impairment existed, the amount of the impairment was computed as the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its estimated fair value, following which the assets were written down to their estimated fair values. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on air travel, including decreased flights, decreased gross passenger opportunity and our airline partners’ temporary parking of a significant number of their aircraft, we conducted a review as of March 31, 2020 and determined that the carrying values for the asset groups related to three of our airline agreements for the CA business exceeded their estimated undiscounted cash flows, which triggered the need to estimate the fair value of these assets. Fair value reflects our best estimate of the discounted cash flows of the impaired assets. For the airborne assets and right-of-use assets associated with the three airline agreements (the “impaired assets”), we recorded an impairment charge of $ 46.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, reflecting the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the impaired assets. We conducted another review as of June 30, 2020 due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the signing of the Delta amendment and determined that $ 1.0 million of deferred STC costs was impaired due to the bankruptcy of three airline partners. As such, we recorded a $ 1.0 million charge for impairment of long-lived assets for the three-month period ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, charges recorded for impairments of long-lived assets totaled $ 47.4 million. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). CA’s airline-directed contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which primarily include the sale of equipment, installation services, connectivity services and entertainment services. For these contracts, we accounted for each distinct good or 89 service as a separate performance obligation. We allocated the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which was based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer, if available. To the extent a good or service was not sold separately, we used our best estimate of the standalone selling price and maximized the use of observable inputs. The primary method we used to estimate the standalone selling price was the expected cost-plus margin approach. The contractual consideration used for allocation purposes includes connectivity and entertainment services, which may be based on a fixed monthly fee per aircraft or a variable fee based on the volume of connectivity activity, or a combination of both. Examples of variable consideration within CA’s airline contracts include megabyte overages and pay-per-use sessions. We constrained our estimates to reduce the probability of a significant revenue reversal in future periods, allocated variable consideration to the identified performance obligations and recognized revenue in the period the services were provided. Our estimates were based on historical experience, anticipated future performance, market conditions and our best judgment at the time. For 2020, our estimates included management’s best assumptions for the continued impact of COVID-19, which included decreased flights and gross passenger opportunity (“GPO”). A significant change in one or more of these estimates could have affected estimated contract value. For example, estimates of variable revenue within certain contracts required estimation of the number of sessions or megabytes that would be purchased over the contract term and the average revenue per connectivity session, which varies based on the connectivity options available to passengers on each airline. Estimated revenue under these contracts anticipated increases in take rates over time and assumed an average revenue per session consistent with our historical experience. We regularly reviewed and updated our estimates, especially in light of COVID-19, and recognized adjustments under the cumulative catch-up method. Any adjustments under this method were recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period identified and revenue for future periods was recognized using the new adjusted estimate. 90 Item 9.

Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2022 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. (b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Gogo Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a – 15(f) and 15d – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Gogo’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The management of Gogo, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have assessed the effectiveness of Gogo’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, the Company’s management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which report is included on Page 92 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Business Who We Are Gogo is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. We have served this market for more than 20 years. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every passenger on every business aviation flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated air-to-ground (“ATG”) networks and engineer and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software. We hold the exclusive license to 4MHz of U.S. nationwide spectrum dedicated to ATG use, as well as exclusive rights to the same spectrum in Canada. We offer our customers a broad suite of integrated equipment, network and Internet connectivity products and services as well as global support capabilities. Our offerings include a customizable suite of smart cabin systems for highly integrated connectivity, in-flight entertainment and voice solutions. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 6,400 ATG business aircraft online of which approximately 2,500 were equipped with our AVANCE platform and approximately 3,900 with Gogo Biz, our legacy ATG broadband system. AVANCE is a software-centric platform that enables us to offer a broad range of products and features and employ multiple spectrum frequencies and networks as new technologies emerge. Of the AVANCE aircraft online at December 31, 2021, approximately 1,700 were equipped with AVANCE L5 and approximately 800 with AVANCE L3, a compact version of AVANCE L5 modified for small business aircraft. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 850 paid subscribers to Gogo Vision, our in-flight video on demand entertainment service. As of such date, we also had approximately 4,600 aircraft online equipped with narrow band satellite solutions that we provide pursuant to distribution agreements with satellite providers. We continually innovate to maintain our leading global market share and support our customers’ needs, and in May 2019, we announced our plans to build our Gogo 5G network for use on business aviation aircraft, commercial regional jets and smaller mainline jets operating within the continental United States and Canada. We continue to expect the new network to be commercially launched on a nationwide basis in the second half of 2022 and have announced completion of several key milestones including finishing construction of our seven-tower testbed, working with Duncan Aviation to complete the first-article Supplemental Type Certificate (“STC”) for the onboard 5G system and signing an agreement with Jet Edge as our 5G launch partner. Gogo 5G will support licensed and unlicensed spectrum and allow us to take advantage of new advances in technology as they are developed. We will continue to provide 3G and 4G service over our ATG networks in North America to augment performance and provide redundancy to the Gogo 5G network. Our technology roadmap includes plans for continued rapid improvement in the performance of our in-flight systems. Our Customers and Distribution Partners Our end users are primarily aircraft owners/operators in the business aviation market. As of December 31, 2021, our market was comprised of approximately 24,100 business aircraft in North America, of which approximately 30% have broadband connectivity, and approximately 14,600 business aircraft in the rest of the world, of which fewer than 6% have broadband connectivity. We sell directly to every Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) of business aviation aircraft including Bombardier, Dassault Falcon, Embraer, Gulfstream, Pilatus and Textron Aviation. In the aftermarket, we sell through a global distribution network of approximately 120 independent dealers who are certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) as aircraft Maintenance and Repair Organizations (“MROs”). Our independent dealers market, resell and obtain FAA-required STCs for our equipment. Our customers also include fractional jet operators such as Flexjet and NetJets, charter operators such as Wheels Up, corporate flight departments and individuals owning aircraft. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,200 customers, none of which accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2021. Upon the closing of the Transaction, we and Intelsat entered into a network sharing agreement (the “ATG Network Sharing Agreement”), pursuant to which we provide certain in-flight connectivity services on our ATG network to Intelsat, subject to certain revenue sharing obligations, and pursuant to which Intelsat has exclusive commercial aviation access to the ATG network in North America, subject to certain revenue guarantees. As of 5 December 31, 2021, our ATG network was accessible to more than 1,300 commercial aircraft, primarily regional jets, operated by Intelsat’s airline customers. Our In-flight Internet Portfolio We focus exclusively on aviation and implement our value proposition of offering the best products and services through a comprehensive portfolio consisting of our in-flight network, in-flight systems, in-flight services, aviation partner support and production operations functions. In-flight Network . Our network solutions are engineered to provide industry-leading cost, capacity, coverage, reliability and aero-performance. We offer business aviation partners a variety of network solutions suitable for operation on most of the world’s business aircraft and one or more of our systems are line fit offerable on the vast majority of aircraft models manufactured by our OEM distribution partners. Our terrestrial network targets approximately 24,100 business aircraft based in North America. Such aircraft generally fly over land and are well-suited for our ATG solutions given their need for smaller antennas, lighter weight equipment and reduced equipment and operating costs. In-flight Systems . To utilize our in-flight network and provide our in-flight services, we have developed proprietary systems of airborne equipment and software. Our in-flight systems are designed for superior performance, future adaptability and ease of certification, installation and maintenance. Each system consists of: (i) an antenna specifically designed for the network and technology being used to provide the service; (ii) a modular in-cabin Wi-Fi network that includes state-of-the art servers, modems and wireless access points; and (iii) system software designed to reliably support a variety of in-flight services provided by Gogo, our aviation partners and third parties. The flexibility of the AVANCE platform provides significant benefits both to customers and Gogo operations. AVANCE provides customers with a common software platform that operates across all Gogo networks and allows aviation partners to customize their passengers’ in-flight experiences by selecting from a variety of offerings that include various levels of connectivity; on-demand entertainment; information and applications; smart cabin customization; and real-time support and tools. The flexibility of the AVANCE platform enables aircraft owners and operators to add or reduce system capabilities as their needs change. AVANCE is designed with a flexible architecture and common componentry across all devices to facilitate equipment standardization and allow Gogo to add multiple products and features, augment spectrum and employ multiple ATG or satellite networks with minimal or no changes to installed hardware or the aircraft. In-flight Services . We provide a wide range of in-flight services for passengers, flight and cabin crews and operational use by our aviation partners. 6 Aviation Partner Support . Engineering, Design and Development . We employ a large in-house Engineering, Design and Development (“ED&D”) organization. ED&D is responsible for translating business requirements into products that comply with rigorous avionics certification requirements. Its capabilities include: (i) a radiofrequency engineering team with expertise in antenna specifications, radio technology, spectrum analysis, network design and regulatory requirements; (ii) an airborne platform development team which manages the design, development and testing of airborne equipment and its integration with ground systems and leads FAA certification efforts; (iii) a product management and systems engineering team that manages all aspects of turning business requirements into technical specifications and is responsible for our program management process; (iv) an application development and business systems organization team that manages development of our internal business systems and the product extensions that sit on the AVANCE platform; and (v) a network engineering team that designs, implements and manages our network and data center infrastructure, security and core network functions. Production Operations . Our manufacturing objective is to produce superior quality products that conform to avionics specifications while providing the best value to our customers. Given our highly specialized technology and required production levels, we design, assemble and test our airborne line replaceable units in-house, while relying on third parties to manufacture specific components based on our design specifications to maximize production efficiencies. We retain the intellectual property associated with the airborne equipment. We also rely on third parties to manufacture our antennas and we generally share antenna design responsibilities and intellectual property with these vendors. Our manufacturing processes include internally designed test fixtures and software that we and our third-party manufacturers employ at all levels of manufacturing. Our manufacturing-related business processes – from sales forecasts to supply chain activities to shipping – are integrated and automated within our enterprise resource planning tools. Our manufacturing and repair facilities are FAA-certified. 7 Competitive Strengths We maintain the leading global market position in connectivity for the business aviation market. We have designed our value proposition to align with our aviation partners’ priorities and we believe that our comprehensive product and service portfolio sets us apart from competitors by better meeting customer needs through: 8 Strategy Our strategy is to maintain and strengthen our leadership position by leveraging the competitive strengths described above to provide high-quality, cost-effective connectivity products and services. The principal elements of our strategy include the following: Competition We compete against both equipment and GEO-satellite based telecommunications service providers to the business aviation market, including Honeywell Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Satcom Direct, Inmarsat and ViaSat. In addition, SmartSky Networks, which in 2014 announced that it planned to launch an ATG network in the continental United States in 2016, has announced that it is currently targeting the second quarter of 2022 as the completion date for its nationwide network. We may in the future face competition from operators of LEO or other non-GEO satellite networks, including OneWeb, Starlink and Telesat, all of which have announced that they are developing in-flight connectivity systems. We believe that the principal points of competition in our market are technological capabilities, price, geographic coverage, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Licenses and Regulation Federal Aviation Administration The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. The dealers and OEMs to which we sell our equipment are generally responsible for obtaining STCs for each aircraft type on which our equipment will be installed, and we support them in those efforts. Separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different owners and operators. After an STC is obtained, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a Parts Manufacturer Approval, or PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facility’s production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements. 9 Certain of our FCC licenses are conditioned upon our ability to obtain from the FAA a “No Hazard Determination” for our cell sites, which indicates that a proposed structure will not, if built as specified, create a hazard to air navigation. When building or altering certain cell sites, we may first be required to obtain such a determination. Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified engineering and other professionals. In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures and quality control systems continue to meet FAA requirements. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities or on aircraft. Foreign Aviation Regulation According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the airworthiness of U.S.-registered and FAA type-certificated aircraft on which FAA-certified Gogo equipment is installed is recognized by civil aviation authorities (“CAAs”) worldwide that are signatories to that Convention. As a result, Gogo does not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering Gogo equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA other than the United States, the installation of Gogo equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority. The FAA holds bilateral agreements with certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement (“BAA”) or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (“BASA”) with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart CAA. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircraft’s country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a Validation Supplemental Type Certificate. For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, Gogo must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification, Gogo will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each aircraft operator’s service in any country in which it registers aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on such aircraft. U.S. Department of Transportation The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) established an Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transportation to negotiate and develop a proposed rule concerning accommodations for passengers with disabilities in three basic areas, including in-flight entertainment (“IFE”) and closed captioning of IFE. The Committee issued a resolution in late 2016 which included its recommendations to the DOT for a rule on IFE. However, since a final rule on IFE has not yet been issued, it is unclear how, if at all, it may impact Gogo. According to the Fall 2020 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions posted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, the projected date of publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) by DOT on Accessible IFE is April 2022. 10 Federal Communications Commission Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC"") licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless services. The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCC’s prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of Gogo by non-U.S. individuals or entities. Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. For example, we provide some of our voice and data services (not including Gogo Biz or AVANCE) by reselling the telecommunications services of two satellite operators. Because we provide these services on a common carrier basis, we are subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. In addition, we provide an interconnected voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) service. The FCC applies many, but not all, of the same regulatory requirements to interconnected VoIP service as it does to common carrier telecommunications services. We offer connectivity service in the United States to business aviation aircraft and, pursuant to the ATG Network Sharing Agreement, to certain commercial aircraft operated by Intelsat’s airline customers, through our own facilities, using our ATG License, a nationwide commercial air-ground radiotelephone license in the 800 MHz band. We obtained and paid for this spectrum through an auction conducted by the FCC. See “ATG License Terms and Conditions.” The FCC’s current rules classify broadband Internet access service as a lightly regulated, non-common carrier “information service,” and remove virtually all of the previously-imposed network neutrality restrictions on blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of broadband providers’ affiliates. We remain subject to certain modified transparency obligations that require disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms. To the extent the FCC further restricts reasonable network management, or to the extent network neutrality proponents prevail on further administrative or appellate review, our business may be affected. Our Internet access service is also subject to the FCC’s data roaming rules, which require commercial mobile data service (“CMDS”) providers like Gogo to negotiate roaming arrangements with any requesting facilities-based, technologically compatible providers of CMDS. The rules do not give other providers the right to install equipment on Gogo-equipped aircraft and do not require the Gogo service to be provided on a discounted basis, although the arrangement must be “commercially reasonable.” The rules allow us to take reasonable measures to safeguard the quality of our service against network congestion that may result from roaming traffic. In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible to persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content offered through our Gogo Vision. In addition to the two ATG licenses, we hold microwave licenses that are used for backhaul in our terrestrial network and an authorization for the provision of voice and data services between the United States and foreign points. ATG License Terms and Conditions The FCC issued our ATG License on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term. We have satisfied our obligation under the license to provide “substantial service” to aircraft, and on January 25, 2017, we received confirmation from the FCC that the license has been renewed until October 31, 2026. Our 1 MHz ATG license obtained in 2013 from LiveTV Airfone, LLC was also originally issued on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term, although there is no “substantial service” obligation that attaches to this license. Our application to renew our license was subsequently granted for an additional 10-year term. On August 3, 11 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is not currently clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. Our two ATG licenses contain certain conditions that require us to comply with all applicable FCC and FAA rules as well as all bilateral agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico regarding the frequencies that are allocated for ATG services. These agreements apply to our use of the spectrum in areas adjacent to the United States’ northern and southern borders and in and out of Canadian and Mexican airspace. A bilateral ATG spectrum coordination agreement between the U.S. and Canada has been negotiated and approved and a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico is pending. In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary a subordinate license that allows us to use Canadian ATG spectrum of which SkySurf Communications Inc. is the primary licensee, and in 2019 the primary license was renewed for an eight-year term expiring June 29, 2027. In 2012, we entered into the License Agreement with SkySurf, which has an initial term of ten years commencing on August 14, 2012, and, provided that the primary spectrum license agreement issued by Industry Canada (now Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada or ISED) to SkySurf remains in effect at such dates, is renewable at our option for an additional 10-year term following the initial expiration and thereafter for a further five-year term. The term of the License Agreement, including the initial 10-year term and any renewals, is contingent on the effectiveness of the primary spectrum license. Any future coordination agreement with Mexico and/or a Mexican ATG licensee could affect our ability to provide our broadband Internet service in the border areas using our current cell sites at current operating power levels and could affect our ability to establish or maintain ATG service in the border areas as aircraft fly into and out of Mexican airspace. Equipment Certification We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of our services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCC’s technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained. Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations We collect personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our service. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties. We use the information that we collect to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection and use of such information are intended to comply with our privacy policy, which is posted on our website; applicable law; and our contractual obligations to aviation partners and other third parties; as well as industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Notwithstanding that broadband Internet access is currently classified as a Title I information service, we must continue to comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Act prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” Although the FTC’s authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by communications common carriers has not been fully delineated, we believe that the FTC has jurisdiction over all of our services. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that among other things: (1) collect, use, share or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy 12 policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the company’s actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information. We are also subject to state “mini-FTC Acts,” which prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state. Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect January 1, 2020 and provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA also imposes compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The California Office of the Attorney General has published final regulations to implement portions of the CCPA. In addition, in November 2020 California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which introduces significant amendments to the CCPA. The CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new regulations are expected to be introduced in 2022. Two other states recently enacted privacy laws: the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) will take effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act will take effect on July 1, 2023. These laws provide broad new privacy rights for Virginia and Colorado consumers, including the right to opt out of targeted advertising and certain profiling activities. There are currently bills pending in the Virginia legislature which would amend the VCDPA prior to its effective date. Regulations relating to the Colorado Privacy Act are expected to be introduced. Depending on these developments, the measures we are required to take to comply with these laws may be significant. Congress and other state legislatures have also been considering legislation relating to privacy and data breaches. Should any additional laws be enacted, they could affect our business. To the extent we collect personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of the European Union (“EU”) took effect, and it has imposed more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the EU that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. EU member states also have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for certain data processing activities. Additionally, in Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 (“PIPEDA”) and substantially similar provincial laws may impose data privacy and security obligations on the processing of personal data. The regulation of data privacy and security in other jurisdictions continues to evolve. In addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries. For example, both Switzerland and the member states of the EU impose restrictions on transferring such data to countries, including the U.S., that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. Certain mechanisms apply under Swiss and EU member state laws that permit the cross-border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Additionally, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (the highest EU court) ruled the EU-US privacy shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCC”) remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues regarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. On September 27, 2021, new versions of the SCC went into effect. Depending on the supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers and implement the SCC, our ability to lawfully transfer personally identifiable information out of relevant jurisdictions to the United States or other jurisdictions may be impacted. 13 Other countries, such as India, have also been considering legislation regarding data protection regulation and data transfers/localization. Should any additional laws be enacted in countries in which we do business, our business could be affected. Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection The FCC’s Truth in Billing rules require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our satellite-based services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers’ billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on ATG services. CALEA The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, which include Gogo, are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered service providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures. We have implemented such policies and procedures and, based upon our periodic self-assessments, we believe that our network is compliant with CALEA. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us. We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States and certain countries outside of the United States. As of February 25, 2022, we held U.S. patents expiring on dates ranging from September 2022 to February 2040 and foreign patents expiring on dates ranging from November 2024 to July 2038. We do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective. We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the United States and certain other countries include, among others, “Gogo,” “Gogo Biz” and “Gogo Vision,” although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We license or purchase from third parties technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors. We also license our proprietary technology and software to third parties to enable them to integrate such technology and software into the products they provide to us. Many of our agreements with such third parties are renewable for indefinite periods of time unless either party chooses to terminate, although some of our agreements expire after fixed periods and require renegotiation prior to expiration in order to extend the term. Among the most material of our technology-related agreements are those for modems, base stations and antennas. Our agreements for modems, base stations and antennas do not renew automatically and thus require periodic renegotiation. Such agreements, as well as certain licenses to commercially available software, are material to our business. Under the terms of the Transaction, we retained ownership of the entire patent portfolio held by Gogo Inc. and its affiliates, including patents developed and obtained in connection with our former commercial aviation business. We have granted Intelsat a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license to our patent portfolio for use in the 14 commercial aviation and satellite mobility businesses (each as defined in the license agreement). Intelsat also has a limited, non-exclusive license right to use certain of our trademarks for up to two years as it transitions to its own brand. We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and vendors. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained. Human Capital We believe that our success is the product of an integrated approach to talent management that touches every part of our business. Rather than focusing on individual processes, we manage our employee ecosystem holistically by encouraging behaviors, conversations, relationships and activities that represent best practices for a high performing culture. We are committed to fostering a highly engaged workforce and in turn driving satisfaction among partners and customers through initiatives that include the following: 15 As of December 31, 2021, women and employees identifying with minority races comprised approximately 27% and 30%, respectively of our workforce. We have nine members on our Board of Directors of which one is Black and a woman. Of the five members on our senior-most Executive Leadership Team, two are women and another is Hispanic/Latinx. While Gogo promotes inclusiveness for all, we are focusing our recruiting efforts on hiring more women and individuals who are Black and have established hiring goals for the next five years. These efforts are supported by our dedicated human resources team and led by our Executive Vice President, Chief People Experience Officer, who is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy and regularly updates our Board of Directors and senior management on the operation and status of our human capital activities. We have always made the health and safety of our employees a top priority, and even more so since the COVID-19 pandemic started. We have implemented work guidelines intended to maintain high productivity while providing employees who can work remotely with the flexibility to do so. We also follow safety and cleaning protocols for those coming into our offices to ensure that we are doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19 related viruses amongst our employees and the community. As of December 31, 2021, we had 376 employees, all of whom were full-time. No employee is a member of a labor union. Corporate Information Gogo Inc. is a holding company that does business through its subsidiaries.

R isk Factors You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below. Risks Related to Our Business We may be unable to continue to generate revenue from the provision of our connectivity services, which could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability. Our business is dependent on our ability to continuously attract and retain users of our connectivity and other service offerings, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts or that customer retention levels will not materially decline. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Gogo service we provided on business aircraft (which excludes service provided on commercial aircraft under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement) generated approximately 75%, 78% and 72% of our revenue from continuing operations, respectively. A significant portion of such service revenue is generated through individual subscription agreements with our customers that cover a single or small number of aircraft, with the remainder generated through subscription agreements with certain fractional or charter operators covering larger fleets of aircraft. These agreements are generally no more than one-year in duration. As such, we have no assurance that any of such customers will renew their existing agreements with us upon expiration on comparable terms or at all, including as a result of a lack of demand or dissatisfaction with our services or the availability of superior or less expensive alternatives in the market. In addition, our subscription agreements are generally terminable at will by our customers and, if terminated, we may not be able to collect amounts we would have otherwise expected to receive during the full term of the agreement. To the extent that our subscribers terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us for any reason, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our subscription agreements do not generally contain minimum commitments for the usage of our connectivity and other services. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of reduced usage of our services by our customers or allow customers to suspend their accounts, which could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability. For example, we experienced a sharp decrease in flight activity, an increase in account suspensions and a decrease in new plan activities in the second quarter and, to a lesser extent, in the third quarter, of 2020 as a result of reduced travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a portion of our revenues is derived from the provision of ATG connectivity services to commercial aircraft. Upon the closing of the Transaction, we and Intelsat entered into the ATG Network Sharing Agreement, pursuant to which we provide certain in-flight connectivity services on our ATG network to Intelsat, subject to certain revenue sharing obligations, and pursuant to which Intelsat has exclusive commercial aviation access to the ATG network in North America, subject to certain revenue guarantees. There can be no assurances that Intelsat will satisfy the revenue guarantees or maximize the revenues we could have generated if it did not have exclusive rights under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement. Revenues from the ATG Network Sharing Agreement accounted for approximately 2% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. We are reliant on our key OEMs and dealers for equipment sales. Revenue from equipment sales accounted for approximately 23%, 21% and 28% of our revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. More than 90% of our equipment revenue in each such fiscal year was generated from contracts with OEMs and after-market dealers. Almost all of our contracts with OEMs and dealers are terminable at will by either party on short notice. If one or more key OEMs or dealers terminates its relationship with us for any reason or our contract expires and is not 17 renewed, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, pursuant to many of our contracts with our OEM distribution partners, we have agreed to deliver equipment and/or services, including equipment and services not yet in production, for a fixed price and, accordingly, take the risk of any cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Certain of our contracts with our OEMs also include provisions that, under specified circumstances, entitle them to the benefit of certain more favorable provisions in other equipment contracts, including with respect to pricing. These provisions, some of which have retroactive effect, may limit the benefits we realize from contracts containing such provisions. Our inability to identify and offer improved terms to a distribution partner or customer in accordance with such a provision could negatively affect our relationship with that distribution partner or customer or give rise to a claim that we are in breach of such contract. Many of our distribution partners have also not committed to purchase any minimum quantity of our equipment. In certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon non-binding production schedules provided by OEMs, historical purchasing patterns and informal discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements. Cancellations, reductions or delays by OEMS and dealers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our distribution partners may be materially adversely impacted by economic downturns and market disruptions. In anticipation of changing economic conditions, OEMs in particular may be more conservative in their production, which may reduce our market opportunities. Further, unfavorable market conditions could cause one or more of our OEMs or dealers to file for bankruptcy, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and could harm our results of operations. Our equipment and service are sold in competitive markets. Some of our current or potential future competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand pricing pressures and the effects of periodic economic downturns. Some of our current or future competitors may offer a broader product line or broader geographic coverage to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if our competitors: We believe that the principal points of competition in our business are technological capabilities, geographic coverage, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, compliance with regulatory certification requirements, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer. In addition, competition may subject us to downward pricing pressures. Pricing at too high a level could adversely affect our ability to gain new customers and retain current customers, while increased competition could force us to lower our prices or lose market position and could adversely affect growth prospects and profitability. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A prospective competitor recently announced that it currently expects its ATG network in the continental United States, originally targeted for launch in 2016, to be completed in the second quarter of 2022. Should such competitor be successful in launching the network and entering our market, we would for the first time face competition from a nationwide ATG network, which could also prompt other competitors to enter this business using the same or other ATG spectrum. Another in-flight connectivity provider has launched service on commercial aircraft in Europe using a hybrid ATG/satellite network. 18 We do not currently offer satellite-based broadband service, and could face competition from owners of LEO and other new non-GEO satellite constellations should they decide to enter our market. A failure to successfully respond to established and new competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to combat it have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decline in international and domestic business aviation travel, which materially and adversely affected our business in 2020. Beginning in March 2020, our business saw a sharp decrease in flight activity, as well as an increase in requests for account suspensions and decreases in new plan activations. Although these and other key business metrics began to recover in the third quarter of 2020 and have since reached pre-COVID levels or better, we continue to monitor the status of the pandemic in the U.S. and internationally. Whether and to what extent COVID-19 impacts our future financial and operational performance will depend on developments that include the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the timetable for administering and efficacy of vaccines, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition to directly impacting demand for air travel, COVID-19 and related restrictions may have a material and adverse impact on other aspects of our business, including: In addition, COVID-19 has had, and may in the future continue to have, an adverse effect on our supply chain. In early 2020, many manufacturers of electronic components reduced their capacity in response to the reduced demand that accompanied the pandemic. While manufacturers have begun to increase manufacturing capacity as demand recovers from the impact of COVID-19, demand has exceeded supply in certain areas, and global shortages of electronic components have occurred. We have experienced longer lead times and encountered delays in obtaining electronic components, and we expect longer lead times and delays to continue. While we believe that we have adequate inventory or will be able to acquire sufficient electronic components to meet customer demand as currently forecasted, increases in demand combined with a continued shortage of electronic components could cause product delays or shortages. We have prepaid the suppliers of certain components to help ensure adequate supply and expect to continue to do so, and we may face price increases for certain components due to the shortages. In addition, the effects of the pandemic include global logistics issues such as shipping logjams, workforce shortages and carrier capacity constraints, all of which may negatively affect our ability to obtain electronic and other components on a timely basis. We cannot predict how long the component shortages or logistics issues will continue. Furthermore, although inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years, the U.S. economy has recently experienced a significant inflationary effect from, among other things, supply chain disruptions and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation, the global COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented uncertainty to the near-term economic outlook. A significant increase in inflation would raise our costs for labor, materials and services, which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. At this time, we are also not able to predict whether the COVID-19 pandemic will result in long-term changes to business practices and consumer behavior, with such changes including but not limited to a long-term reduction in travel as a result of increased usage of “virtual” and “teleconferencing” products. The full extent of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control. 19 We may be unsuccessful at evaluating or pursuing strategic opportunities, which could adversely affect our revenue, financial condition and results of operation. Our Board and management continuously assess whether shareholder value would be increased by engaging in strategic and/or financial relationships, transactions or other opportunities, including those that are suggested to us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we will pursue any strategic or financial relationship, transaction or other opportunity, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Further, the process of evaluating and pursuing any such relationship, transaction or other opportunity will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks relating to assessing and undertaking strategic opportunities, it may disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, financial condition and results of operation. We depend upon third parties, many of which are single-source providers, to manufacture equipment components, provide services for our network and install and maintain our equipment. We rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components and services that we use to provide our services. Many suppliers of critical components of our equipment are single-source providers. Components for which we rely on single-source suppliers include, among others, the antennas and modems for all systems and the equipment used at our ATG cell site base stations. If we are required for any reason (including expiration of the contract, termination by one party for material breach or other termination events) to find one or more alternative suppliers, we estimate that the replacement process could take up to two years depending upon the component, and we may not be able to contract with such alternative suppliers on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Finding and contracting with suppliers of some components may be delayed or made more difficult by current suppliers’ ownership of key intellectual property that requires alternative suppliers to either obtain rights to such intellectual property or develop new designs that do not infringe on such intellectual property. In addition, many of our components, such as the equipment used in our base stations, are highly integrated with other system components, which may further lengthen the time required for an alternative supplier to deliver a component that meets our system requirements. We also rely on third parties to provide the links between our data centers and our ground network. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our inventory needs and production schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The supply of third-party components and services could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers or a significant decline in their financial condition. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute our growth strategy. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business. Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries such as ours is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our ATG networks and related technology and develop and successfully deploy our technology roadmap and new wireless telecommunications products and technology. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees may have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel, including Oakleigh Thorne, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Gogo and its operations. As a result, if any of our key personnel were to leave Gogo, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key 20 employees. In addition, much of our key technology and systems is custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, could disrupt our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdowns, may have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the nature, extent, timing or likelihood of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of any economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States or in the aviation industry. A weaker business environment could lead to a decrease in air travel, cause owners and operators of business aircraft to cut costs by reducing their purchases or use of private aircraft or their use of in-flight Internet access on such aircraft or reduce the number of airline passengers on commercial aircraft to which we supply ATG network access. Should an economic slowdown occur in the U.S. or globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may not be able to fully utilize portions of our deferred tax assets, which would negatively impact our earnings and other comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our determination that we are more likely than not to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets resulted in a release of approximately $195.8 million of our valuation allowance. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates—Deferred Income Taxes - Valuation Allowance,” our determination that we are more likely than not to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets represents our best estimate and considers both positive and negative factors. We considered positive factors including the sale of our CA business, the reduction in interest expense resulting from the Refinancing, strong demand for our products and services and pre-tax income from continuing operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2021. The negative factors included cumulative pre-tax losses from continuing operations in the three-year period ending with the current quarter and our relatively short history of pre-tax income from continuing operations. It is possible that there will be changes in our business, our performance, our industry or otherwise that cause actual results to differ materially from this estimate. If those changes result in significant and sustained reductions in our pre-tax income or utilization of existing tax carryforwards in future periods, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded, which could have a material adverse impact on earnings and/or other comprehensive income. Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property We may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying Gogo 5G or other next generation technologies. We are currently developing a next generation ATG network using 5G technology and unlicensed spectrum, which we intend to launch on a commercial, nationwide basis in the second half of 2022. Gogo 5G will be capable of working with different spectrum and supporting different next generation technologies. There can be no assurance that we will launch Gogo 5G or any other next generation technology in sufficient time to meet growing user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience and to effectively compete in the business aviation market, due to, among other things, risks associated with: (i) our failure to design and develop a technology that provides the features and performance we require; (ii) integrating the solution with our existing ATG network; (iii) the availability of adequate spectrum; (iv) the failure of spectrum to perform as expected; (v) the failure of equipment and software to perform as expected; (vi) problems arising in the manufacturing process; (vii) our ability to negotiate contracts with suppliers on acceptable commercial and other terms; (viii) our reliance on single-source suppliers for the development and manufacturing of the core elements of the network and on other suppliers to provide certain components and services; and (ix) delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. As disclosed above under the caption “ — Risks Related to Our Business — The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to combat it have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business,” we have experienced longer lead times and encountered delays in obtaining certain electronic components used in our business. For instance, manufacturing issues with respect to a 5G component necessitated manufacturing process revisions and additional testing, which delayed the delivery date for this component, and the supplier of the 21 component has informed us that the component is taking longer than expected to manufacture, which will further delay delivery. We believe that we can accommodate the supplier’s current expectations for the delivery date for this component without affecting our service launch, but the repeated compression of our schedule related to this component could limit our ability to preserve the current schedule should other significant issues arise. If Gogo 5G or any other next generation technology fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines we establish, our ability to meet users' expectations regarding our systems' performance and to effectively compete in our market may be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our business is dependent on the availability of spectrum. In June 2006, we purchased at FCC auction an exclusive ten-year, 3 MHz license for ATG spectrum, and in April 2013, as part of our acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC, we acquired an additional 1MHz ATG spectrum license. In 2017, our applications to renew our licenses were granted for additional ten-year terms without further payment. Any breach of the terms of our FCC licenses or FCC regulations including foreign ownership restrictions, permitted uses of the spectrum and compliance with FAA regulations could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of our licenses or a refusal by the FCC to renew the licenses upon expiration. Further, in connection with an application to renew our licenses upon expiration, a competitor could file a petition opposing such renewal on anti-competitive or other grounds. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is currently not clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. While we do not currently use this license, changes in technology may enable its use in our network in the future. An ambiguous renewal requirement could impair our flexibility to use or otherwise realize the value of such spectrum beyond 2026. Our ability to offer in-flight broadband Internet access through our ATG service currently depends on our ability to maintain rights to use the 3 MHz ATG spectrum in the U.S., and our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to meet increasing performance demands and expand our service offerings in the United States will depend in part upon our ability to successfully roll-out our plans to employ unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band for concurrent use with the licensed 3 MHz spectrum and to launch Gogo 5G, and may require that we obtain additional licensed or unlicensed spectrum suitable for our use. Such spectrum may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain adequate spectrum could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional ATG spectrum, whether licensed or unlicensed, is or may become available in the future. While we have exclusive rights to the only broadband spectrum licensed by the FCC for ATG use and are currently the only provider offering a nationwide ATG network to business aircraft in the United States, the FCC may in the future decide to auction additional spectrum for ATG use that is not currently designated for that purpose, or a competitor could develop technology or a business plan that allows it to cost effectively use spectrum not specifically reserved for ATG, but on which ATG use is not prohibited, to provide broadband connectivity. The availability of additional spectrum in the marketplace that is available for ATG use may increase the possibility that we may face competition from one or more other ATG service providers in the future. For example, a prospective competitor has announced that it expects to complete an ATG network in the continental U.S. in the second quarter of 2022. Such network will use the same unlicensed spectrum that we intend to aggregate with our licensed spectrum for use in our Gogo 5G network. 22 We could be adversely affected if we suffer service interruptions or delays, technology failures, damage to our equipment or system disruptions or failures arising from, among other things, force majeure events, cyber-attacks or other malicious activities. Our brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depend upon the reliable performance of our ground network and in-flight systems. We have experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, and we may experience service interruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures, which may be due to factors beyond our control. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation, brand and customer retention could be harmed, and such failures could be material breaches of our customer contracts resulting in termination rights, penalties or claims for damages. Our operations and services depend upon the extent to which our equipment is protected against damage or interruption from fire, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events. The capacity, reliability and security of our network infrastructure are important to the operation of our business, which may suffer in the event of system disruptions or failures, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities. Our networks may be vulnerable to these attacks and unauthorized access. Assertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. We are currently facing, and may in the future face, claims that we or a supplier have violated patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Many companies, including our competitors, are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could potentially cover many aspects of our business. While we have reviewed the patent portfolios of certain competitors and other third parties, we have not exhaustively searched all patents relevant to our technologies and business and therefore it is possible that we may be unknowingly infringing the patents of others. Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious and whether or not they result in litigation, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our merchandizing or marketing and advertising activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Pursuant to our contracts with certain customers, we have agreed to indemnify such customers against such claims, and our indemnification obligations generally include defending or paying for the defense of the action and paying any judgments or other costs assessed against the customer in the event of an adverse outcome. In most cases, our contracts do not cap our indemnification obligations. In addition, certain of our suppliers do not indemnify us for third-party infringement or misappropriation claims arising from our use of supplier technology, and we may be liable in the event of such claims. Our inability to meet our indemnification obligations and our customers terminating or failing to renew their contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We or our technology suppliers may be unable to continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to customers and passengers. The market for our services is characterized by evolving technology, changes in customer and passenger needs and performance expectations, and frequent new service and product introductions. Our success will depend, in part, on our and our suppliers’ ability to continue to enhance existing technology and services or develop new technology and services on a timely and cost-effective basis. If we or our suppliers fail to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, customer requirements and/or regulatory requirements, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We expect to have to invest significant capital to keep pace with innovation and changing technology, and if the amount of such investment exceeds our plans or the amount of investment permitted under the Credit Agreement, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 23 As is common in industries like ours, changing technology may result in obsolescence as we implement new technologies and products and retire old technologies and products. As we encounter such obsolescence, we need to ensure that we have a sufficient supply of parts, products and equipment compatible with our existing technology, as well as access to maintenance, repair and other critical support services, until the transition is completed. Certain suppliers may determine to stop manufacturing and supplying end-of-life parts, products and equipment, or may stop providing related services, prior to completion of our transition. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient inventory from existing suppliers we would be required to engage new suppliers who have access to the intellectual property required to manufacture and support components that meet our specifications, and we may be unable to contract with such suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We have implemented policies and procedures intended to ensure that we timely anticipate technology and product transitions and have access to sufficient inventory and services, but if such policies prove ineffective and we are unable to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business to effect a transition, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, following our retirement of end-of-life technologies and products, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand and might have to write off unusable inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought and obtained patent protection for certain of our technologies in the United States and certain other countries. Many of the trademarks that we use (including marks we have applied to register) contain words or terms having a somewhat common usage, such as “Gogo” and “Gogo Vision” and, as a result, we may have difficulty registering them in certain jurisdictions. We do not own, for example, the domain www.gogo.com and we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we do business or may do business in the future. If other companies have registered or have been using in commerce similar trademarks for services similar to ours in foreign jurisdictions, we may have difficulty in registering, or enforcing an exclusive right to use, our marks in those foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be effective, that any patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not obtain intellectual property rights to similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Furthermore, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries in which our service is or may in the future be offered may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our ability to exploit our proprietary technology or our brand image may be harmed, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our use of open-source software could limit our ability to commercialize our technology. Open-source software is software made widely and freely available to the public in human-readable source code form, usually with liberal rights to modify and improve such software. Some open-source licenses require as a condition of use that proprietary software that is combined with licensed open-source software and distributed must be released to the public in source code form and under the terms of the open-source license. Accordingly, depending on the manner in which such licenses were interpreted and applied, we could face restrictions on our ability to commercialize certain of our products and we could be required to: (i) release the source code of certain of our proprietary software to the public, including competitors, if the open-source software was linked in a manner that would require such release of our proprietary software source code; (ii) seek licenses from third parties for replacement software; and/or (iii) re-engineer our software in order to continue offering our products. Such consequences may materially adversely affect our business. 24 The failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation, result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages, and impair our ability to sell our service. Our products contain complex systems, components and software that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology or when new software is first introduced or new versions or enhancements are released. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. In addition, such events could result in significant expenses and diversion of development and other resources, a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our products and services, loss of existing customers, terminations of, failures to renew, penalties or damage claims under aviation partner contracts, harm to our reputation and brand image and increased insurance costs. If our in-flight system has a malfunction resulting from an error or defect or a problem with installation or maintenance and such malfunction causes physical damage to an aircraft or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could expose us to substantial personal injury claims, product liability claims or costly repair obligations. The aircraft operated by our customers may be very costly to repair and the damages in any product liability claims could be material. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we indemnify some of our customers for losses due to third-party claims and in certain cases the causes of such losses may include failure of our products. Should we be required by the FAA or otherwise to cease providing the Gogo service, even on a temporary basis, as a result of a product malfunction or defect, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons, we could lose our FCC license. Under the Communications Act and applicable FCC regulations, we are effectively restricted from having more than 25% of our capital stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons, including individuals and entities organized outside the United States or controlled by non-U.S. persons. We have established procedures to ascertain the nature and extent of our foreign ownership, and we believe that the indirect ownership of our equity by foreign persons or entities is below the 25% cap. However, as a publicly traded company we may not be able to determine with certainty the exact amount of our stock that is held by foreign persons or entities at any given time. A failure to comply with applicable restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. persons could result in an order to divest the offending ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or spectrum license revocation proceedings, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. Any breach of the terms of our ATG spectrum licenses or other licenses and authorizations obtained by us from time to time, or any violation of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of a license or the imposition of fines. From time to time, the FCC may monitor or audit compliance with the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules or with our licenses, including if a third party were to bring a claim of breach or noncompliance. In addition, the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, may be amended in the future in a manner that could be adverse to us. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Business—Licenses and Regulation—Federal Aviation Administration,” FAA approvals required to operate our business include STCs and Parts Manufacture Approval (PMA). While our distribution partners are responsible for obtaining STCs, obtaining PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. Prior to installation of our equipment, any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining (including as a result of a government shutdown or funding shortages), or change in, needed FAA certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our installation commitments, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business. 25 Following installation of our equipment, if we were to discover that our equipment or components of our equipment were not in compliance with specifications on which the STC authorizing installation was based, or if the FAA’s requirements changed, our non-compliance could result in our incurring material costs to inspect and in some circumstances modify or replace such equipment, and could in rare circumstances result in our system being turned off or installed aircraft being grounded. If we fail to comply with the FAA’s many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the FAA certifications, authorizations, or other approvals on which our manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance and alteration capabilities are based. In addition, from time to time, the FAA or comparable foreign agencies adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. The FAA could also change its policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies, which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, our compliance costs would likely increase. As a broadband Internet provider, we must comply with CALEA, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Currently, our CALEA solution is fully deployed in our network. However, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC or law enforcement agencies for any delays in complying or failure to comply with, CALEA or similar obligations. Such enforcement actions could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders or other penalties, all of which may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, to the extent the FCC adopts additional capability requirements applicable to broadband Internet providers, its decision may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations. We are also subject to regulation by certain foreign laws and regulatory bodies, including ISED, which issued our exclusive Canadian ATG subordinate spectrum license and regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us. Adverse decisions or regulations of these U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are unable to predict the impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business. Our possession and use of personal information present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation. In the ordinary course of our business, we or our third-party providers collect, process and store sensitive data, including personal information of our employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information (and other sensitive data such as our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers) is critical to our operations and business strategy. We depend on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party providers of telecommunications, cloud computing, customer support and other vendors. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, hardware or software defects or other disruptions. Further, our in-cabin network operates as an open, unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, and non-encrypted transmissions users send over this network may be vulnerable to access by other users on the same plane. Unauthorized use of our, or our third-party service providers’, networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including personal information of passengers using our service. Data security threats are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that any security measures we, or third parties, take will be effective in preventing these activities, given the constantly changing nature of the threats. Any such security incidents, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under our contracts with certain customers, which generally require us to indemnify the customer for passenger and other third-party claims arising from data security breaches. In addition, such incidents may disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to protect confidential user data or to provide users with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to investigations and regulatory penalties imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies, non-U.S. regulatory agencies or courts. For example, the FTC could assert jurisdiction to impose penalties 26 if it found our privacy policies or security measures to be inadequate under existing federal law. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Business—Licenses and Regulation—Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations,” we could also be subject to certain state laws, including so-called “mini-FTC Acts”, that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these rules or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also must comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our voice services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. Our failure to comply with these requirements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other countries in which we may operate or from which our services may be offered, including those in the European Union (“EU”), also have certain privacy and data security requirements that may apply to our business, either now or in the future. These countries’ laws may in some cases be more stringent than the requirements in the United States. For example, European Union member countries have specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions, including to the United States. In addition, some countries have stricter consumer notice and/or consent requirements relating to personal information collection, use or sharing. Moreover, international privacy and data security regulations have become more complex. In May 2018, the GDPR took effect, which has imposed even more restrictive privacy-related requirements. EU member states also have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for certain data processing activities. Similarly, PIPEDA and substantially similar Canadian provincial laws impose data privacy and security obligations on our processing of personal data. Despite the substantial preparation and related expenditures that we have undertaken to be in compliance with international privacy laws, there can be no assurance that we are or will continue to be in compliance. The regulation of data privacy and security in the EU and in other jurisdictions continues to evolve, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate effect of evolving regulation and implementation over time. Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect January 1, 2020 and provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA also imposes compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent, and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The California Office of the Attorney General has published final regulations to implement portions of the CCPA. In addition, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which introduces significant amendments to the CCPA. The CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new regulations are expected to be introduced. In addition, two other states recently enacted specific privacy laws: the VCDPA will take effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act will take effect on July 1, 2023. These laws provide broad new privacy rights for Virginia and Colorado consumers, including the right to opt out of targeted advertising and certain profiling activities. There are currently bills pending in the Virginia legislature which would amend the VCDPA prior to its effective date. Regulations relating to the Colorado Privacy Act are expected to be introduced. Depending on these developments, the measures we are required to take to comply with these laws may be significantly impacted. Our failure to comply with GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, VCDPA, Colorado Privacy Act, PIPEDA or other privacy or data security-related laws, rules or regulations imposed by U.S. federal or state governments or agencies or foreign governments or agencies could result in material penalties imposed by regulators or cause us to be in material breach under our airline agreements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be sure that a regulator would deem our security measures to be appropriate given the lack of prescriptive measures in certain data protection laws. Without more specific guidance, we cannot know whether our chosen security safeguards are adequate according to each applicable data protection law. Given the evolving nature 27 of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be sure that our chosen security safeguards will protect against security threats to our business. Even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our or our partners’ information technology systems and the data contained in those systems. Moreover, interpretations or changes to new or existing data protection laws may impose on us responsibility for our employees and third parties that assist with aspects of our data processing. As a result, our employees’ or third parties’ intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase our vulnerability or expose us to security threats, such as phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for a successful phishing attack despite the quality and otherwise legal sufficiency of our security measures. Expenses or liabilities resulting from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Gogo Inc. and certain of our current and former executives are defendants in a securities class action lawsuit, and we are a nominal defendant, and members of our Board of Directors and certain current and former executives are defendants, in a related stockholder derivative lawsuit. We are required to indemnify the directors and current and former officers who are defendants in the class action and derivative lawsuits for their defense costs and any judgments resulting from such suits. In the future, we may be subject to additional securities class action or derivative litigation. From time to time, we may also be subject to other claims or litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including for example, claims related to employment matters. Our operations are characterized by the use of new technologies and services across multiple jurisdictions that implicate various statutes and a range of rules and regulations that may be subject to broad or creative interpretation. This may result in litigation, including class action lawsuits, the outcome of which may be difficult to assess or quantify due to the potential ambiguity inherent in these regulatory schemes and/or the nascence of our technologies and services. Plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products and services, or require us to pay significant monetary damages, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce our existing contracts and, even if successful, may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation by or against any customer or supplier could have the effect of negatively impacting our reputation and goodwill with existing and potential customers and suppliers. Regulations related to conflict minerals force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex. We are subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which requires us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals.” These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of certain of the materials used in the manufacture of components in our products and equipment. In addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. 28 Risks Related to Our Indebtedness For definitions of capitalized terms used and not defined in the following Risk Factors, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We and our subsidiaries have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment. As of December 31, 2021, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $824.2 million, including $721.4 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and $102.8 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 2022 Convertible Notes. We and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future, including up to $100.0 million under the Revolving Facility, which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to:  a meaningful portion of our cash flows from operations is expected to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes may be limited, and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness may be impaired in the future;  we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and which, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;  our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase;  our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future;  it may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;  we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and  our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, our growth strategy and our efforts to improve operating margins of our business units. We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all. We have from time to time evaluated, and we continue to evaluate, our potential capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, limitations on bandwidth capacity and performance and generally evolving technology in our industry. We may utilize one or more types of capital raising in order to fund any initiative in this regard, including the issuance of new equity securities and new debt securities, including debt securities convertible into our common stock. Our ability to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and the extent and timing of certain capital and other necessary expenditures are subject to numerous variables, such as costs related to execution of our current technology roadmap, including continuing development and deployment of Gogo 5G and other future technologies. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all or our operating cash flows may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2021 Credit Agreement and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited by the 2021 Credit Agreement. In the future, if our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios or other covenant exceptions set forth in the 2021 Credit Agreement, our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness, which indebtedness may be secured or unsecured, the incurrence of which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. 29 Events beyond our control can affect our ability to comply with these requirements. The 2021 Credit Agreement also limits the ability of Gogo Inc. to incur additional indebtedness under certain circumstances and limits the amount of cash that our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us. The terms of any additional financing may further limit our financial and operating flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use the proceeds from any such financing to repay a portion of our outstanding debt. If we raise additional funds or seek to reduce our current levels of indebtedness through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and we may grant holders of such securities rights with respect to the governance and operations of our business. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could adversely impact our ability to operate our business. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, us to: Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the 2021 Credit Agreement may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such agreements and instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, may limit our ability in the future to satisfy currently outstanding obligations and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. An increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our indebtedness and could reduce our profitability. Our debt outstanding under the Term Loan Facility bears interest, and any indebtedness under our Revolving Facility would bear interest, at variable rates. While we have entered into interest rate caps to hedge a portion of our exposure, we remain subject to interest rate risk under these facilities. Increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Any indebtedness under our 2021 Credit Agreement may bear interest at variable rates that use the London inter-bank offered rate (“LIBOR”). In addition, any payments made under our interest rate caps are based on the three-month LIBOR interest rate. The upcoming cessation of the availability of LIBOR may adversely affect our 30 business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop encouraging or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). On March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, and FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator, or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, for all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings, and immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (the “LIBOR Announcement”). No modification has been made to our 2021 Credit Agreement relating to the applicable benchmarks for borrowings, although such changes may be required or otherwise made in the future. It is not possible to predict the effect that the LIBOR Announcement, the discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR, but financial products with interest rates tied to LIBOR may be adversely affected. Once LIBOR ceases to be published, it is uncertain whether it will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. Indebtedness under the Facilities is secured by substantially all of our assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities, if we were to become insolvent, to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our secured indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility. Indebtedness under the Facilities is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, if an event of default were to occur under the 2021 Credit Agreement, to the extent amounts were outstanding under the Facilities, the lenders party to the 2021 Credit Agreement would have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations under the 2021 Credit Agreement, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries’ unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility. A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us, our subsidiaries or our indebtedness, if any, could cause our cost of capital to increase. Our Term Loan has been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline. The trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our IPO, which occurred on June 21, 2013 and in which shares of common stock were sold at a price of $17.00 per share. From the IPO date through February 25, 2022, the price of our common stock has ranged from a closing low of $1.40 per share to a closing high of $34.34 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include: 31 In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many such companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adjustments by holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes of their hedging positions in our common stock and the forward stock purchase transactions, or any modifications of the forward stock purchase transactions, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Any buying or selling of shares of our common stock by holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes to establish or adjust hedged positions with respect to our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2022 Convertible Notes may also encourage short selling by market participants because any conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes could depress our common stock price. The price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the 2022 Convertible Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation, and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity, which we expect to occur involving our common stock. 32 On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated privately negotiated prepaid forward stock purchase transaction (the “Amended and Restated Forward Transaction”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the “Forward Counterparty”), which replaced the prepaid forward stock purchase transaction entered into with the Forward Counterparty in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The Amended and Restated Forward Transaction is generally expected to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions, including swaps, between the Forward Counterparty and investors in the 2022 Convertible Notes relating to shares of our common stock by which investors in the 2022 Convertible Notes will establish short positions relating to shares of our common stock and otherwise hedge their investments in the 2022 Convertible Notes. The maturity date of such Amended and Restated Forward Transaction is on or around May 15, 2022, the maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. Such investors may enter into other transactions in connection with or in addition to such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of shares of our common stock. As a result of the existence of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction, such derivative transactions and any related market activity could cause more purchases or sales of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction than there otherwise would have been had we not entered into the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. Such purchases or sales, including sales made in connection with any refinancing or repurchase of our 2022 Convertible Notes, could potentially increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. In addition, in connection with any repurchase of our 2022 Convertible Notes, the Forward Counterparty may elect to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction early in accordance with its terms, which would result in a delivery of shares of our common stock to us earlier than the maturity date described above. In addition, we may request that the Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”), sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request for the Forward Counterparty to effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the Forward Counterparty on such terms as we may agree with the Forward Counterparty at the time. Additionally, the Forward Counterparty (or its affiliates) is likely to modify its hedge positions in respect of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock and/or by purchasing the shares of common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction (and are likely to do so during the final valuation period under the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction and on or around any election by the Forward Counterparty to settle all of a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction early). The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock. The Forward Counterparty is a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that it might default under the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Forward Counterparty is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the Forward Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the Forward Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the Forward Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. 33 Future stock issuances could cause substantial dilution and a decline in our stock price. We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangement, as consideration to third-party service or equipment providers or otherwise. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The conversion of some or all of the remaining 2022 Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion. In November 2021, we informed the trustee under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes that we intend to settle any conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes occurring after November 15, 2021 in shares of our common stock. The 2022 Convertible Notes are convertible at the election of holders and, to date, approximately $1.0 million of 2022 Convertible Notes were converted into shares of common stock. In addition, approximately $134.0 million of 2022 Convertible Notes have been exchanged for shares of common stock pursuant to privately negotiated exchange agreements. We may issue additional shares of common stock upon any future conversion or exchange of 2022 Convertible Notes pursuant to their terms or otherwise. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2022 Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Additional shares of common stock are also issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options. We may also reserve additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or other similar forms of equity incentives. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. A few significant stockholders, including affiliates of Oakleigh Thorne, our Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO, could exert influence over our company, and if the ownership of our common stock continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. As of December 31, 2021, Oakleigh Thorne, our President and CEO and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, and the entities affiliated with Mr. Thorne (the “Thorne Entities”) beneficially owned approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and funds managed by GTCR LLC (“GTCR”) beneficially owned approximately 29% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, either the Thorne Entities or GTCR alone is able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including approval of significant corporate transactions and the election of directors. Such ability to influence may reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, together, GTCR and the Thorne Entities would be able to exercise control over such matters, which similarly may reduce the market price of our common stock. As our President and CEO, Mr. Thorne has control over our day-to-day management and the implementation of major strategic initiatives and investments by our company, subject to authorization and oversight by our Board of Directors. As a member of our Board of Directors, Mr. Thorne owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Thorne is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interest, which may not always be in the interests of stockholders generally. Our corporate governance guidelines address potential conflicts between a director’s interests and our interests, and our code of business conduct, among other things, requires our employees and directors to avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with their job responsibilities or our interests and to disclose their outside activities, financial interests or relationships that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict to management or corporate counsel. These corporate governance guidelines and code of business ethics do not, by themselves, prohibit transactions with the Thorne Entities. 34 Fulfilling our obligations associated with being a public company is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price. As a public company, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”), and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as NASDAQ rules, require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public company obligations requires us to devote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. We are also required under Sarbanes-Oxley to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Our ability to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls will depend, in part, on our ability to transition responsibility for certain internal control processes from personnel whom we no longer employ following the Transaction to our employees. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls may materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ, or other regulatory authorities. The utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an “ownership change” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $689 million in federal and $523 million in state NOLs. The federal NOLs begin to expire in 2031. The state NOLs expire in various tax years beginning in 2022. Under Section 382 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as an increase of more than 50% of the value of the Company’s stock owned by certain “5-percent shareholders,” as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code, in its equity ownership over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. In September 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, and declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company outstanding on the record date of October 2, 2020, to the stockholders of record on that date. The Rights Agreement is designed to facilitate the Company’s ability to protect its NOLs and certain other tax attributes in order to be able to offset potential future income taxes for federal income tax purposes. The Rights Agreement may make it more difficult for the Company to undergo an ownership change by deterring a third party from acquiring 4.9% or more of the shares of our common stock. This may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging any individual, firm, corporation, partnership or other person or group of affiliated or associated persons from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more shares of our common stock then outstanding. In addition, although the Rights Agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect utilization of our NOLs, there is no assurance that the Rights Agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our common stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control, including through conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, our Board of Directors may determine that it is in the best interests of the Company to exempt certain transactions, that could result in an ownership change, from triggering the Rights Agreement. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOLs is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. 35 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, and certain provisions in our existing and any future credit facility could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include: Additionally, our Board of Directors adopted the Rights Agreement, which is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code by deterring a third party from acquiring 4.9% or more of our shares of common stock then outstanding. The Rights Agreement, as well as the provisions described above, may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of the Rights Agreement or such provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. The Rights Agreement as well as the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management or Board of Directors. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes, holders may require us to purchase the 2022 Convertible Notes for cash, subject to certain conditions. In addition, under the terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement, a takeover of our company would allow the administrative agent and/or the lenders to terminate their commitments under the 2021 Credit Agreement and declare any and all outstanding amounts to be due and payable. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership by non-U.S. citizens, including the power of our Board of Directors to redeem shares of our common stock from non-U.S. citizens. The Communications Act and FCC regulations impose restrictions on foreign ownership of FCC licensees, as described in the above risk factor, “— Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property—If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license .” Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions that permit our Board of Directors to take certain actions in order to comply with FCC regulations regarding foreign ownership, including but not limited to, a right to redeem shares of common stock from non-U.S. citizens at prices at or below 36 fair market value. Non-U.S. citizens should consider carefully the redemption provisions in our certificate of incorporation prior to investing in our common stock. These restrictions may also decrease the liquidity and value of our stock by reducing the pool of potential investors in our company and making the acquisition of control of us by third parties more difficult. In addition, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to attract equity financing or consummate an acquisition of a foreign entity using shares of our capital stock. 37 Item 1B. Unresolv ed Staff Comments None. Item 2. Pr operties Currently, we lease approximately 120,000 square feet for our business in Broomfield, Colorado, under a lease agreement that expires in 2029. In addition, we lease approximately 11,700 square feet in Chicago, Illinois for those of our employees who live in the metropolitan Chicago area under a lease agreement that expires on May 31, 2032. We believe that our existing facilities will be adequate for the foreseeable future. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to several lawsuits arising out of the conduct of our business. See Note 18, ""Commitments and Contingencies,"" to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of litigation matters. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material adverse impact on our company due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted, which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as damages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs. Item 4. Mine Saf ety Disclosures Not applicable. 38 Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information for Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “GOGO” since June 21, 2013. Holders of Record As of February 25, 2022, there were 37 stockholders of record of our common stock, and the closing price of our common stock was $14.08 per share as reported on the NASDAQ. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On December 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our commercial aviation (“CA”) business to a subsidiary of Intelsat Jackson Holdings S.A. (“Intelsat”) for a purchase price of $400.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the “Transaction”). As a result, all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as discontinued operations. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Our fiscal year ends December 31 and, unless otherwise noted, references to years or fiscal are for fiscal years ended December 31. See “— Results of Operations.” Company Overview Gogo is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every passenger on every flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated air-to-ground (“ATG”) networks, engineer and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software, and deliver customizable connectivity and wireless entertainment services and global support capabilities to our aviation partners. Our services include narrowband satellite-based voice and data services made available through strategic partnerships with satellite providers. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and business results for our operations, and makes resource and operating decisions, on a consolidated basis. As we do not have multiple segments, we do not present segment information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decline in international and domestic business aviation travel, which materially and adversely affected our business in 2020. Beginning in March 2020, our business saw a sharp decrease in flight activity, as well as an increase in requests for account suspensions and decreases in new plan activations. Although these and other key metrics began to recover in the third quarter of 2020 and have since reached pre-COVID levels or better, we continue to monitor the status of the pandemic in the United States and internationally. We are unable to predict whether COVID-19 will have a material adverse effect on our business in the future or with what degree of severity or over what length of time such impact may occur. Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations We believe that our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that affect the business aviation industry, including trends affecting the travel industry and trends affecting the customer bases that we target, as well as factors that affect wireless Internet service providers and general macroeconomic factors. Key factors that may affect our future performance include: 41 Key Business Metrics Our management regularly reviews financial and operating metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate the performance of our business and our success in executing our business plan, make decisions regarding resource allocation and corporate strategies, and evaluate forward-looking projections. For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Aircraft online (at period end) ATG 6,400 5,778 5,669 Satellite 4,567 4,702 5,001 Average monthly connectivity service revenue per aircraft online ATG $ 3,238 $ 2,951 $ 3,113 Satellite 250 212 249 Units sold ATG 869 667 909 Satellite 205 199 560 Average equipment revenue per unit sold (in thousands) ATG $ 71 $ 68 $ 69 Satellite 54 59 39 42 Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations As a result of the Transaction, all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as a discontinued operation. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. The results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented. Refer to Note 2, ""Discontinued Operations,"" to our consolidated financial statements for further information. The following briefly describes certain key components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Revenue: We generate two types of revenue: service revenue and equipment revenue. Service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services. Service revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Beginning December 2020, service revenue includes revenue earned from the ATG Network Sharing Agreement with Intelsat. Equipment revenue primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of ATG and satellite connectivity equipment and entertainment equipment. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped to OEMs and dealers. Cost of Revenue: Cost of service revenue consists of ATG network costs, satellite provider service costs, transaction costs and costs related to network operations. Before closing the Transaction, we operated two divisions – business aviation (“BA”) and commercial aviation (“CA”). In January 2019, BA assumed responsibility for operating and maintaining our ATG network and was allocated the majority of the ATG network costs incurred in fiscal year 2019. In January 2020, we adopted a new allocation methodology for the ATG network costs utilizing pricing and usage for each of CA and BA. This 43 allocation methodology has been applied retrospectively to prior periods presented as the CA business is reported in discontinued operations. Upon the completion of the Transaction, we ceased allocating ATG network costs to the divested CA business. Cost of equipment revenue primarily consists of the costs of purchasing component parts used in the manufacture of our equipment and the production, installation, technical support and quality assurance costs associated with the equipment sales. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses include the costs incurred to design and develop our technologies and products and to obtain and maintain FAA and other regulatory certifications. This includes the design, development and integration of our ATG ground networks and airborne line replaceable units, the design and development of products and enhancements thereto, and program management activities. Engineering, design and development expenses also include costs associated with enhancements to existing products. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with activities related to customer sales (including sales commissions), digital marketing and lead generation, advertising and promotions, product management, trade shows and customer service support for end users. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses include personnel and related operating costs of the business support functions, including finance and accounting, legal, human resources, administrative, information technology, facilities and executive groups. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation expense includes expense associated with the depreciation of our network equipment, office equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements, which is recorded over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense includes the amortization of our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to ten years depending on the assets being amortized. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related exposures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In some instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets have the greatest potential impact on and are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and that they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies to which many of these critical estimates relate, see Note 3, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" to our consolidated financial statements. 44 Note that these critical accounting estimates relate solely to our continuing operations. The accounting policies related to our discontinued operations are discussed in Note 2, ""Discontinued Operations,"" to our consolidated financial statements. Deferred Income Taxes - Valuation Allowance: We account for the valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (""ASC 740""). On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets, which includes consideration of both positive and negative evidence to determine, based on the weight of the available evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. In our assessment, we consider recent financial operating results, the scheduled expiration of our net operating losses, potential sources of taxable income, the reversal of existing taxable differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted under tax law) and tax planning strategies. We have a recent history of financial reporting losses, resulting in cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter which is objectively verifiable negative evidence regarding future profitability. Cumulative pre-tax losses from continuing operations adjusted for the reduction in interest expense resulting from the Refinancing (as defined below) result in positive normalized income over the same three-year period. This is objectively verifiable positive evidence of our ability to generate positive earnings in the future. When there is a recent history of operating losses and a return to operating profitability has not yet been demonstrated, we cannot rely on projections of future earnings for purposes of assessing recoverability of our deferred tax assets and instead must use our historical earnings for this assessment. In such cases, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. Our determination that we are more likely than not to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets represents our best estimate and considers both positive and negative factors. We considered positive factors including the sale of our CA business, the reduction in interest expense resulting from the Refinancing, strong demand for our products and services and pre-tax income from continuing operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2021. The negative factors included cumulative pre-tax losses from continuing operations in the three-year period ending with the current quarter and our relatively short history of pre-tax income from continuing operations. It is possible that there will be changes in our business, our performance, our industry or otherwise that cause actual results to differ materially from this estimate. If those changes result in significant and sustained reductions in our pre-tax income or utilization of existing tax carryforwards in future periods, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or other comprehensive income. Such adverse impacts may be material. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our determination that we are more likely than not to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets resulted in a release of approximately $195.8 million of our valuation allowance. The remaining valuation allowance is still required for deferred tax assets related to certain state and foreign NOLs, capital losses, and the Section 163(j) interest limitation carryforward, as we determined that it was more likely than not that, as of December 31, 2021, these deferred tax assets will not be realized. See Note 16, ""Income Tax,"" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 45 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our consolidated statements of operations. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Consolidated Statements of Operations Data (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Revenue: Service revenue $ 259,583 $ 211,987 $ 221,922 Equipment revenue 76,133 57,731 87,063 Total revenue 335,716 269,718 308,985 Operating expenses: Cost of service revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 56,103 45,073 42,142 Cost of equipment revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 46,092 39,299 51,744 Engineering, design and development 24,874 25,227 26,013 Sales and marketing 20,985 15,135 21,236 General and administrative 51,554 54,467 54,628 Depreciation and amortization 15,482 14,166 16,690 Total operating expenses 215,090 193,367 212,453 Operating income 120,626 76,351 96,532 Other (income) expense: Interest income (191 ) (722 ) (4,000 ) Interest expense 67,472 125,787 130,473 Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes 83,961 — 57,962 Other (income) expense 25 (9 ) 31 Total other expense 151,267 125,056 184,466 Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (30,641 ) (48,705 ) (87,934 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (187,230 ) (146 ) 563 Net income (loss) from continuing operations 156,589 (48,559 ) (88,497 ) Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (3,854 ) (201,477 ) (57,507 ) Net income (loss) $ 152,735 $ (250,036 ) $ (146,004 ) Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 Revenue: Revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years Ended % Change December 31, 2021 over 2021 2020 2020 Service revenue $ 259,583 $ 211,987 22.5 % Equipment revenue 76,133 57,731 31.9 % Total revenue $ 335,716 $ 269,718 24.5 % Revenue increased to $335.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $269.7 million for the prior year, due to increases in service and equipment revenue. Service revenue increased to $259.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $212.0 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in ATG aircraft online, an increase in average monthly service revenue per aircraft online and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenue share from the ATG Network 46 Sharing Agreement with Intelsat, which went into effect in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Average monthly service revenue per ATG unit online increased to $3,238 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $2,951 for the prior year. Equipment revenue increased to $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $57.7 million for the prior year, primarily due to increases in the number of ATG units sold, with 869 ATG units sold during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared with 667 units for the prior year. We expect service revenue to increase in the future as additional ATG aircraft come online and average monthly connectivity service revenue per ATG aircraft online increases. We expect equipment revenue to increase in the future as additional ATG units are sold, but expect a portion of such increase to be offset by a decrease in the average selling price. Cost of Revenue: Cost of service revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years Ended % Change December 31, 2021 over 2021 2020 2020 Cost of service revenue $ 56,103 $ 45,073 24.5 % Cost of equipment revenue $ 46,092 $ 39,299 17.3 % Cost of service revenue increased to $56.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $45.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in ATG network costs as these costs are no longer shared with the divested CA business and an increase in network and data center operating costs related to the separation from the CA business, partially offset by a credit for regulatory surcharges from which we are now exempt. We expect cost of service revenue to increase over time, primarily due to service revenue growth and increasing ATG network costs associated with Gogo 5G. Cost of equipment revenue increased to $46.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $39.3 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in ATG units sold. We expect that our cost of equipment revenue will increase over time with growth in ATG units sold and, in the near term, an increase in cost per ATG unit. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses decreased to $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $25.2 million for the prior year, due to lower expensed Gogo 5G development costs, partially offset by an increase in personnel costs driven by COVID-related cost controls implemented in the prior year. We expect engineering, design and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue to increase slightly in the near term, driven by Gogo 5G development costs, and decrease over the long term as the level of Gogo 5G investment decreases and revenue increases. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses increased to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $15.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs driven by COVID-related cost controls implemented in the prior-year and an increase in marketing and promotional costs. 47 We expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue to remain relatively unchanged in the long term but increase slightly in the near term driven by Gogo 5G marketing spend. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses decreased to $51.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $54.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to corporate cost savings, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation in the current period and an increase in personnel costs driven by COVID-related cost controls implemented in the prior year. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue to decrease over time as the business grows given the fixed cost nature of this category and as we realize the full run rate of completed cost savings initiatives. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $14.2 million for the prior year, primarily due to the amortization of capitalized software. We expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase in the future as we launch our Gogo 5G network. Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years % Change Ended December 31, 2021 over 2021 2020 2020 Interest income $ (191 ) $ (722 ) (73.5 )% Interest expense 67,472 125,787 (46.4 )% Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes 83,961 — nm Other (income) expense 25 (9 ) nm Total $ 151,267 $ 125,056 21.0 % Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with nm. Total other expense increased to $151.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with $125.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense. We expect our interest expense to decrease in the future as a result of the Refinancing, the conversions and exchanges of the 2022 Convertible Notes that have occurred to date and the maturity or earlier conversion of the remaining 2022 Convertible Notes in 2022. See Note 10, ""Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,"" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 611.0%, as compared with 0.3% for the prior year. The income tax benefit of $187.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a result of a partial release of the valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets during the year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not significant primarily due to the full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. See Note 16, ""Income Tax,"" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 48 We expect our income tax provision to increase in future periods as we generate positive pre-tax income. Discontinued Operations: Loss from discontinued operations decreased to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared with a loss of $201.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to the closing of the Transaction on December 1, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, loss from discontinued operations was primarily related to stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by the recognition of a gain on sale of discontinued operations that was recorded as a deferred gain on sale at December 31, 2020. See Note 2, ""Discontinued Operations,"" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 "" Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 11, 2021, includes a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020. Non-GAAP Measures In our discussion below, we discuss Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as defined below, which are non-GAAP financial measurements. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow for business planning purposes, including managing our business against internally projected results of operations and measuring our performance and liquidity. These supplemental performance measures also provide another basis for comparing period-to-period results by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. These supplemental performance measures may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not recognized measurements under GAAP; when analyzing our performance with Adjusted EBITDA or liquidity with Free Cash Flow, as applicable, investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure, and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments, (ii) use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative to, net income (loss) attributable to common stock as a measure of operating results and (iii) use Free Cash Flow in addition to, and not as an alternative to, consolidated net cash provided by (used in) operating activities when evaluating our liquidity. Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA represents net income (loss) attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) stock-based compensation expense included in the results of continuing operations, (ii) the results of discontinued operations, including stock-based compensation expense and the gain on the sale of CA, (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes and (iv) separation costs related to the sale of CA. Our management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that management believes have less bearing on our operating performance, thereby highlighting trends in our core business which may not otherwise be apparent. It also provides an assessment of controllable expenses, which are indicators management uses to determine whether current spending decisions need to be adjusted in order to meet financial goals and achieve optimal financial performance. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense from Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate given the significant variation in expense that can result from using the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of such compensation. The fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model and varies based on fluctuations in the assumptions used in this model, including inputs that are not necessarily directly related to the performance of our business, such as the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the options. Therefore, we believe that the exclusion of this cost provides a clearer view of the operating performance of our business. Further, stock option grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily 49 reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. While we believe that investors should have information about any dilutive effect of outstanding options and the cost of that compensation, we also believe that stockholders should have the ability to consider our performance using a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these costs and that management uses to evaluate our business. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the results of our discontinued operations from Adjusted EBITDA because they are not part of our ongoing operations. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes from Adjusted EBITDA because these activities are not related to our operating performance. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude separation costs related to the sale of CA from Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2021 because of the non-recurring nature of this activity. We also present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides investors, securities analysts and other users of our consolidated financial statements with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management. Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of intangible assets. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides meaningful information regarding our liquidity. Gogo Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (in thousands, except per share amounts) (unaudited) For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Adjusted EBITDA: Net income (loss) attributable to common stock (GAAP) $ 152,735 $ (250,036 ) $ (146,004 ) Interest expense 67,472 125,787 130,473 Interest income (191 ) (722 ) (4,000 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (187,230 ) (146 ) 563 Depreciation and amortization 15,482 14,166 16,690 EBITDA 48,268 (110,951 ) (2,278 ) Stock-based compensation expense 13,345 7,808 8,654 Loss from discontinued operations 3,854 201,477 57,507 Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes 83,961 — 57,962 Separation costs related to CA sale 1,550 — — Adjusted EBITDA $ 150,978 $ 98,334 $ 121,845 Free Cash Flow: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (GAAP) $ 66,697 $ 4,513 $ (12,872 ) Consolidated capital expenditures (8,660 ) (8,990 ) (6,473 ) Free cash flow $ 58,037 $ (4,477 ) $ (19,345 ) Material limitations of Non-GAAP measures Although EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are measurements frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow each 50 have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include: Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically financed our growth and cash needs primarily through the issuance of common stock, non-convertible debt, senior convertible preferred stock, convertible debt, term facilities and cash from operating activities. We continually evaluate our ongoing capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, capacity requirements, evolving user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience, evolving technologies in our industry and related strategic, operational and technological opportunities. We actively consider opportunities to raise additional capital in the public and private markets utilizing one or more of the types of capital raising transactions through which we have historically financed our growth and cash needs, as well as other means of capital raising not previously used by us. See the disclosure below under the heading “Debt Instruments” for the definitions of the debt and convertible debt instruments to which we refer in this section, as well as the indentures and other agreements that govern them. Based on our current plans, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, including capital expenditure requirements and the principal amount of any 2022 Convertible Notes that remain outstanding at maturity. Over the long term, we believe that cash flows provided by operating activities and our expected access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements. As detailed in Note 10, ""Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,"" on April 30, 2021, GIH entered into the 2021 Credit Agreement with Gogo, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which provides for the Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $725.0 million, issued with a discount of 0.5%, and the Revolving Facility, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility. The Term Loan Facility amortizes in nominal quarterly installments equal to 1% of the aggregate initial principal amount thereof per annum, with the remaining balance payable upon final maturity on April 30, 2028. There are no amortization payments under the Revolving Facility, and all borrowings under the Revolving Facility mature on April 30, 2026. Our intent is to continue to access the capital markets to refinance our future debt obligations on an as-needed basis. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of GIH and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Further, market conditions and/or our financial performance may limit our access to 51 additional sources of equity or debt financing, or our ability to pursue potential strategic alternatives. As a result, we may be unable to finance the growth of our business to the extent that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash generated through operating activities prove insufficient or we are unable to raise additional financing through the issuance of equity, permitted incurrences of debt (by us or by GIH and its subsidiaries), or the pursuit of potential strategic alternatives. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used, together with cash on hand, (i) to redeem in full and pay the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes together with accrued and unpaid interest and redemption premiums and to pay fees associated with the termination of the ABL Credit Agreement (together with the redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the “Refinancing”), and (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing and the Facilities (the “Transaction Costs”). The Revolving Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes of Gogo and its subsidiaries and was undrawn as of December 31, 2021. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier converted into shares of our common stock. In November 2021, we informed the trustee under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes that we intend to settle any conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes occurring after November 15, 2021 in shares of our common stock. To the extent any 2022 Convertible Notes remain outstanding at maturity, we currently expect to pay such principal amount through cash on hand. In May 2021, we purchased interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of $650.0 million for $8.6 million. We receive payments in the amounts calculated pursuant to the caps for any period in which the three-month USD LIBOR rate increases beyond the applicable strike rate. The termination date of the cap agreements is July 31, 2027. The notional amounts of the interest rate caps periodically decrease over the life of the caps. While the interest rate caps are intended to limit our interest rate exposure under our variable rate indebtedness, which includes the Facilities, if our variable rate indebtedness does not decrease in proportion to the periodic decreases in the notional amount hedged under the interest rate caps, then the portion of such indebtedness that will be effectively hedged against possible increases in interest rates will decrease. In addition, the strike prices periodically increase over the life of the caps. As a result, the extent to which the interest rate caps will limit our interest rate exposure will decrease in the future. For additional information on the interest rate caps, see Note 11, ""Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"" to our consolidated financial statements. Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, and given our cash position and the upcoming maturity of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we are evaluating the return of capital to our stockholders, which may take the form of stock repurchases. The implementation of any capital allocation policy, including any declaration of stock repurchases or other distributions, will be at the discretion of, and subject to the approval by, our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, liquidity and capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by Delaware law, general business conditions and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant in making any such determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will make any stock repurchases or make other distributions or returns on our common stock, or as to the amount of any such stock repurchases, distributions or returns of capital. 52 Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations, comprised of our material future cash requirements and deferred revenue arrangements, as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands) .

Such commitments will become payable as we receive the hardware components or as development services are provided. Leases and Cell Site Contracts: We have lease agreements relating to certain facilities and equipment, which are considered operating leases. See Note 17, ""Leases,"" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Indemnifications and Guarantees : In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential 53 amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. Cash Flows The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Cash flows from continuing operations: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 66,697 $ 4,513 $ (12,872 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (16,289 ) (8,990 ) 32,850 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (331,037 ) 44,479 (2,830 ) Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations (9,013 ) 220,139 (30,339 ) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash 40 (1,946 ) (250 ) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (289,602 ) 258,195 (13,441 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 435,870 177,675 191,116 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 146,268 $ 435,870 $ 177,675 Supplemental information: Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 146,268 $ 435,870 $ 177,675 Less: current restricted cash 25 525 560 Less: non-current restricted cash 330 — 7,099 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 145,913 $ 435,345 $ 170,016 Following is a discussion of the year-over-year changes in cash flow activities. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations: The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Net income (loss) $ 156,589 $ (48,559 ) $ (88,497 ) Non-cash charges and credits (69,027 ) 42,677 103,951 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (20,865 ) 10,395 (28,326 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations $ 66,697 $ 4,513 $ (12,872 ) For the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $66.7 million, as compared with cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $4.5 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the increase in operating cash flows were: 54 For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $4.5 million, as compared with cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of $12.9 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the increase in operating cash flows were: Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations: Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $16.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, while cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Investing activities are comprised of capital expenditures related to software development, data center upgrades and cell site construction. Additionally, cash used in investing activities from continuing operations includes the purchase of interest rate caps for $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and net changes in our short-term investments consisting of a cash inflow of $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations: Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $331.0 million, primarily due to the redemption of all of our outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes (including the make-whole premium payable under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes) for a redemption price totaling $1,023.1 million and the payment of $20.3 million of deferred financing fees associated with the issuance of the Facilities, offset in part by $721.4 million of gross proceeds from the Term Loan Facility. Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $44.5 million, primarily due to the $51.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of additional 2024 Senior Secured Notes, offset by the repurchase of convertible notes, payments on finance leases and stock-based compensation activity. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.8 million, primarily due to the redemption of our outstanding 2022 Senior Secured Notes (including the make-whole premium payable under the indenture governing the 2022 Senior Secured Notes) for a redemption price totaling $741.4 million, the repurchase of $159.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes and the payment of $23.0 million of deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of additional 2024 Senior Secured Notes, offset in part by $920.7 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of 2024 Senior Secured Notes. 55 Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations: Cash used in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $9.0 million, primarily due to $7.8 million used in investing activities for a payment to Intelsat in settlement of working capital adjustments relating to the Transaction and $1.2 million used in operating activities primarily to pay the employer portion of taxes related to the vesting of equity awards and the exercise of stock options. Cash provided by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $220.1 million as compared to cash used by discontinued operations of $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $250.4 million change was primarily due to a $464.0 million increase in cash provided by investing activities offset by a $214.1 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was due to the $386.3 million of proceeds received in the Transaction and a $79.9 million decrease in capital expenditures due to the impact of COVID-19 on the installation of CA equipment on airline partners’ aircraft. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $133.1 million increase in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, and an $81.0 million decrease in cash flows related to operating assets and liabilities primarily due to changes in accounts receivable, inventory, deferred lease proceeds and accrued liabilities, offset in part by changes in accounts payable and contract assets. Capital Expenditures Our business requires significant capital expenditures, primarily for technology development, equipment and capacity expansion. Capital spending for continuing operations for the periods presented in this report is associated with the expansion of our ATG network and data centers. We capitalized software development costs related to network technology solutions and new product/service offerings. We also capitalized costs related to the build-out of our office locations. For the periods presented in this report, capital expenditures for our former CA business, presented as discontinued operations, included the significant purchase of airborne equipment related to the roll out and/or upgrade of service to our former airline partners’ fleets. Capital expenditures for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $8.7 million , $9.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2021 as compared with 2020 was primarily due a decrease in capitalized software, partially offset by an increase in network-related equipment, and the increase in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to an increase in capitalized software. We expect that our capital expenditures will increase in the near term as we build out Gogo 5G and further invest in capitalized software, and decrease significantly after the Gogo 5G build out is substantially completed in 2022. Debt Instruments Following is a discussion of the debt instruments we had in place as of December 31, 2021 as well as those we utilized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 2021 Credit Agreement On April 30, 2021, Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) (""GIH"") entered into a credit agreement (the ""2021 Credit Agreement"") among Gogo, GIH, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which provides for (i) a term loan credit facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $725.0 million, issued with a discount of 0.5%, and (ii) a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility” and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Facilities”) of up to $100.0 million, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility. The Term Loan Facility amortizes in nominal quarterly installments equal to 1% of the aggregate initial principal amount thereof per annum, with the remaining balance payable upon final maturity on April 30, 2028. There are no amortization payments under the Revolving Facility, and all borrowings under the Revolving Facility mature on April 30, 2026. The Term Loan Facility bears annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH’s option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus an applicable margin of 3.75% or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75%. 56 Loans outstanding under the Revolving Facility bear annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH’s option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate (subject to a floor of 0.00%) plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.25% to 3.75% per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25% to 2.75% per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. Additionally, unused commitments under the Revolving Facility are subject to a fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2021, the fee for unused commitments under the Revolving Facility was 0.25%. The Facilities may be prepaid at GIH’s option at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs), subject to minimum principal payment amount requirements. Subject to certain exceptions and de minimis thresholds, the Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to: (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, insurance recovery and condemnation events, subject to reduction to 50% and 0% if specified senior secured first lien net leverage ratio targets are met; (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain debt offerings; and (iii) 50% of annual excess cash flow (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement), subject to reduction to 25% and 0% if specified senior secured first lien net leverage ratio targets are met. The Revolving Facility includes a financial covenant set at a maximum senior secured first lien net leverage ratio of 7.50:1.00, which will apply if the outstanding amount of loans and unreimbursed letter of credit drawings thereunder at the end of any fiscal quarter exceeds 35% of the aggregate of all commitments thereunder. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, which, if any of them occurred, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the Facilities to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the Revolving Facility to be terminated. 2022 Convertible Notes On November 21, 2018, we issued $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier converted into shares of our common stock. In November 2021, we informed the trustee under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes that we intend to settle any conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes occurring after November 15, 2021 in shares of our common stock. We pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2019. The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.00 per share of our common stock. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are considered in the diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method. Holders may convert the 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time prior to January 15, 2022, but only in the following circumstances: 57 The Stock Price Condition was triggered for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2021, April 1, 2021 through June 30, 2021, July 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021 and October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2022 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after January 15, 2022 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2022. In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2022 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. In January 2021, $1.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes was converted by holders and settled through the issuance of 166,666 shares of common stock. On March 17, 2021, Gogo entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements (the “March 2021 Exchange Agreements”) with certain holders of 2022 Convertible Notes. Pursuant to the March 2021 Exchange Agreements, such holders exchanged a total of $28,235,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes for 5,121,811 shares of our common stock on March 24, 2021. The negotiated exchange rate under the March 2021 Exchange Agreements was 181.40 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on settlement of $4.4 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. On April 1, 2021, Gogo entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement (the “GTCR Exchange Agreement”) with an affiliate of funds managed by GTCR. Pursuant to the GTCR Exchange Agreement, GTCR exchanged $105,726,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes for 19,064,529 shares of our common stock on April 9, 2021. The negotiated exchange rate under the GTCR Exchange Agreement was 180.32 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on settlement of $14.6 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. 2024 Senior Secured Notes On April 25, 2019 (the “Issue Date”), GIH and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo Finance” and, together with GIH, the “Issuers”) issued $905.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”), at a price equal to 99.512% of their face value, under an indenture, dated as of April 25, 2019, among the Issuers, Gogo, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Issuers issued an additional $20.0 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes on May 7, 2019, which were issued at a price equal to 100.5% of their face value, and $50.0 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes on November 13, 2020, which were issued at a price equal to 103.5% of their face value. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Gogo and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Gogo Finance), subject to certain exceptions. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees were secured by certain liens on the Company’s collateral, certain of which were released upon the closing of the Transaction and the remainder on the Redemption Date as defined below. 58 The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were redeemed on May 1, 2021 (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price equal to 104.938% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the Redemption Date. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $48.1 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $15.2 million and the remaining debt discount of $1.3 million, which together are included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. ABL Credit Facility On August 26, 2019, Gogo Inc., GIH and Gogo Finance entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent, which provides for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”) of up to $30.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. The obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement were guaranteed by Gogo and all of its existing and future subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and secured by certain collateral of the Company. On April 30, 2021, the ABL Credit Agreement and all commitments thereunder were terminated. As a result of the termination, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.3 million were written off as of May 1, 2021 and included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. 2022 Senior Secured Notes On June 14, 2016, the Issuers issued $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the “2022 Senior Secured Notes”) under an indenture, dated as of June 14, 2016, among the Issuers, Gogo, the subsidiary guarantors, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and as collateral agent. On January 3, 2017, the Issuers issued $65.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2022 Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 108% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $70.2 million. On September 20, 2017, the Issuers issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 2022 Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 113% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $113.0 million. Additionally, we received approximately $2.9 million for interest that accrued from July 1, 2017 through September 24, 2017, which was paid in our January 2018 interest payment. The 2022 Senior Secured Notes were redeemed on May 15, 2019. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $51.4 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $9.1 million and the remaining debt premium of $11.7 million relating to the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in connection with the redemption thereof, which together are included in the Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. 2020 Convertible Notes On March 3, 2015, we issued $340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $21.9 million was subsequently exercised during March 2015, resulting in a total issuance of $361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes. We paid interest on the 2020 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest payments began on September 1, 2015. In November 2018, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we repurchased $199.9 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes at par value. On April 18, 2019, we commenced a cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase any and all of the outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for an amount equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date on the 2020 Convertible Notes to, but not including, the date of payment for the 2020 Convertible Notes accepted in the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer expired on May 15, 2019, resulting in the purchase of $159.0 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. As a result of the Tender Offer, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $8.5 million to 59 face value and unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.6 million were expensed. These two items are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. During September 2019, we purchased an additional $0.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes matured on March 1, 2020. The 2020 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 41.9274 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.85 per share of our common stock. We had the option to elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Forward Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we paid approximately $140.0 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the “Forward Transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “Forward Counterparties”), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to one of the Forward Transactions (the “Amended and Restated Forward Transaction”) to extend the expected settlement date with respect to approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock held by one of the Forward Counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the “2022 Forward Counterparty”), to correspond with the May 15, 2022 maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. In the future, we may request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the 2022 Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the 2022 Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The 2022 Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the 2022 Forward Counterparty on such terms as may be mutually agreed upon at the time. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders’ equity within our consolidated balance sheets was reduced by approximately $140.0 million. In March 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. In April 2021, approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. The approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transactions are treated as retired shares for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding. Restricted Cash Our restricted cash balances were $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The balance as of December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of a letter of credit issued for the benefit of the landlord of our new office location in Chicago, IL. The balance as of December 31, 2020 consisted of a letter of credit issued for the benefit of the landlord of our current office location in Broomfield, CO. For additional information on the 2021 Credit Agreement, the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the ABL Credit Facility, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes, see Note 10, ""Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,"" to our consolidated financial statements. 60 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and debt. We have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments through a variety of securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, and money market funds. Our cash and cash equivalents as of both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 primarily included amounts in bank deposit accounts and money market funds, and we did not have any short-term investments as of either such date. We believe that a change in average interest rates would not affect our interest income and results of operations by a material amount. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ. Interest Rate Risk: We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate indebtedness, which includes borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility (if any). We assess our market risks based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential impact on earnings and cash flows based on a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, we had interest rate cap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate movements of our variable rate debt and to manage our interest expense. We receive payments in the amounts calculated pursuant to the caps for any period in which the three-month USD LIBOR rate increases beyond the applicable strike rate. The termination date of the cap agreements is July 31, 2027. Over the life of the interest rate caps, the notional amounts of the caps periodically decrease, while the applicable strike prices increase. The notional amount of outstanding debt associated with interest rate cap agreements as of December 31, 2021 was $650.0 million. Based on our December 31, 2021 outstanding variable rate debt balance, a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the three-month LIBOR interest rate would impact our annual interest expense by approximately $0.3 million, which includes the impact of our interest rate cap at a strike rate of 0.75%. Excluding the impact of our interest rate caps, a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the three-month LIBOR interest rate would impact our annual interest expense by approximately $3.3 million. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in the three-month LIBOR interest rate would not impact our annual interest expense due to the LIBOR floor of 0.75% in our Term Loan Facility. Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest income generated from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents as of both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 included amounts in bank deposit accounts and money market funds. We believe we have minimal interest rate risk as a 10% decrease in the average interest rate on our portfolio would have reduced interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 by immaterial amounts. Inflation: We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. 61 Item 8. Financial Statemen ts and Supplementary Data Gogo Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gogo Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 3, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”), using the modified retrospective approach. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Income Taxes — Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets — Refer to Notes 3 and 16 to the financial statements The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for tax attributes and are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse. The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance related to deferred income tax assets to determine, based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of such deferred assets will not be realized. The Company’s assessment considers recent financial operating results, the scheduled expiration of its net operating losses, potential sources of taxable income, the reversal of existing taxable differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, if permitted under tax law, and tax planning strategies. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize $185.1 million of its deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2021. We identified management’s determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize deferred income tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments management makes related to taxable income. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates of taxable income. 63 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize deferred income tax assets included the following, among others: /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Chicago, Illinois March 3, 2022

Statements 69 Gogo Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Background Gogo (“we”, “us,” “our”) is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every passenger on every flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated air-to-ground (“ATG”) networks, engineer and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software, and deliver customizable connectivity and wireless entertainment services and global support capabilities to our aviation partners. Our services include narrowband satellite-based voice and data services through our strategic alliances with satellite providers. On December 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our commercial aviation (“CA”) business to a subsidiary of Intelsat Jackson Holdings S.A. (“Intelsat”) for a purchase price of $ 400.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the “Transaction”). At the closing of the Transaction, the parties entered into certain ancillary agreements, including a transition services agreement, an intellectual property license agreement and commercial agreements. These agreements include an ATG network sharing agreement, pursuant to which we provide certain in-flight connectivity services on our current ATG network and, when available, our Gogo 5G network, subject to certain revenue sharing obligations. Under the ATG network sharing agreement, Intelsat has exclusive access to the ATG network for commercial aviation in North America, subject to minimum revenue guarantees starting at $ 5.0 million in the first year of the agreement. As a result of the Transaction, the CA business is reported in discontinued operations and all periods presented in this Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as a discontinued operation. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. Discontinued operations reporting occurs only when the disposal of a component or a group of components (i) meets the held-for-sale classification criteria or is disposed of by sale or other than by sale, and (ii) represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. The results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, discussion in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refers to our continuing operations. Refer to Note 2, ""Discontinued Operations,"" for further information. Prior to the closing of the Transaction, we historically reported our results of operations in three segments: Commercial Aviation-North America (“CA-NA”), Commercial Aviation-Rest of World (“CA-ROW”) and Business Aviation. We managed and reported these businesses separately, as they generally did not share the same customer base, had different products, pricing and expense structures, and measured operating performance and allocated resources on different bases. As a result of the Transaction, we operate in a single distinct business segment, Business Aviation, for which operating performance is measured and resources are allocated on a consolidated basis, consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, our CEO. Therefore, we now report one business segment, comprised of our continuing operations. As we do not have multiple segments, we do not present segment information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our revenue from customers domiciled outside of the United States accounted for less than 10 % of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our assets outside of the United States as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial. 2. Discontinued Operations As discussed in Note 1, ""Background,"" on December 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our CA business to Intelsat. As a result of the Transaction, the CA business is reported for all periods as discontinued operations. The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations which are presented as Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, in our consolidated statements of operations (in thousands) : 70 For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Revenue: Service revenue $ — $ 192,616 $ 442,431 Equipment revenue — 40,483 84,310 Total revenue — 233,099 526,741 Operating expenses: Cost of service revenue (exclusive of items shown below) — 145,958 255,706 Cost of equipment revenue (exclusive of items shown below) — 33,978 82,984 Engineering, design and development — 57,167 82,597 Sales and marketing — 24,121 27,920 General and administrative 6,283 40,551 35,215 Impairment of long-lived assets — 47,375 — Depreciation and amortization — 119,827 102,127 Total operating expenses 6,283 468,977 586,549 Operating loss ( 6,283 ) ( 235,878 ) ( 59,808 ) Other (income) expense: Gain on sale of CA business ( 1,598 ) ( 37,958 ) — Other (income) expense — 3,134 ( 2,744 ) Total other (income) expense: ( 1,598 ) ( 34,824 ) ( 2,744 ) Loss before income taxes ( 4,685 ) ( 201,054 ) ( 57,064 ) Income tax provision (benefit) ( 831 ) 423 443 Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ ( 3,854 ) $ ( 201,477 ) $ ( 57,507 ) The following discussion relates entirely to discontinued operations. Gain on sale – Upon the closing of the Transaction on December 1, 2020, we received initial gross proceeds of $ 386.3 million, which reflects the $ 400.0 million purchase price, adjusted for cash, debt, transaction expenses and working capital. The final purchase price was subject to change due to customary post-closing purchase price adjustment procedures set forth in the purchase and sale agreement between Gogo and Intelsat, that were not yet complete. As the post-closing purchase price adjustment was not yet finalized and therefore represented a contingent gain, $ 9.4 million was recorded as a deferred gain on sale included within Accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2020. During December 2020, we recognized within Gain on sale of CA business a pretax gain on sale of $ 38.0 million, computed as the $386.3 million of initial gross proceeds less (i) the potential $ 9.4 million post-closing purchase price adjustment not yet finalized, (ii) the carrying value of the assets and liabilities transferred in the Transaction and (iii) Transaction-related costs. In October 2021, the independent accounting firm engaged to resolve a dispute between the parties regarding the working capital matter determined the final amount of the working capital adjustments to be $ 7.8 million. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Gogo paid Intelsat the $7.8 million and recognized an additional Gain on sale of CA business of $ 1.6 million. Stock-based compensation – In August 2020, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) approved modifications to the vesting conditions and exercise periods of outstanding equity compensation awards held by certain of our then-current employees who became employees of Intelsat in the Transaction. These modifications became effective upon the consummation of the Transaction. Pursuant to such modifications, the options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) held by Intelsat employees generally vested on the earlier of (i) the original vesting date and (ii) December 1, 2021; provided that the employee did not voluntarily resign from and was not terminated for cause by Intelsat prior to such date. Certain of these awards vested based on conditions that are not classified as a service, market or performance condition and as a result such awards were classified as a liability. Other than mark-to-market adjustments, a ll costs related to stock-based compensation for our prior employees who became employees of Intelsat in the Transaction were recognized as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, $ 24.0 million was reclassified from Accrued liabilities to Additional paid-in capital as the awards vested during the period. As of December 31, 2021, there were no remaining liability-classified awards. 71 The following is a summary of our stock-based compensation expense by operating expense line contained within the results of discontinued operations for the years December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands) : 2021 2020 2019 Cost of service revenue $ — $ 7,647 $ 1,497 Cost of equipment revenue — — — Engineering, design and development — 5,836 2,398 Sales and marketing — 7,911 2,144 General and administrative 4,817 4,413 1,819 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 4,817 $ 25,807 $ 7,858 See Note 15, ""Stock-Based Compensation and 401(k) Plan,"" for additional information on our stock-based compensation plans. Other Costs Classified to Discontinued Operations – During the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $ 1.5 million of additional costs (exclusive of the gain on sale, stock-based compensation expense noted above and income tax benefit) primarily due to employer-paid taxes arising from the exercise of stock options by former employees then employed by Intelsat. Change in estimates – During the second quarter of 2020, our agreement with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) to provide 2Ku service on certain Delta aircraft was amended to change the contract expiration date from February 2027 with respect to all aircraft to a staggered, fleet by fleet expiration schedule under which expiration dates will occur between November 2020 and July 2022 (the “Delta amendment”). As a result, the useful lives of the equipment installed on these fleets were shortened to align with the expiration dates in the amended agreement. The change in estimated useful lives resulted in approximately $ 41.0 million of accelerated depreciation during the year ended December 31, 2020. We ceased depreciating these assets and other depreciable assets included as part of discontinued operations when the CA business was classified as held for sale. Additionally, the amortization periods for the remaining deferred airborne lease incentives associated with the equipment installed on the 2Ku fleets were shortened to align with the new expiration dates, which resulted in approximately $ 42.0 million of accelerated amortization during the year ended December 31, 2020. Amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives is a reduction to cost of service revenue. Credit Losses – During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $ 10.7 million of provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to one international airline partner entering bankruptcy administration, while we had recoveries of approximately $ 0.6 million. Arrangements with commercial airlines – For our divested CA business, pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we placed our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines in order to deliver our service to passengers on the aircraft. We had two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. Under the airline-directed model, we transferred control of the equipment to the airline and therefore the airline was our customer in these transactions. Under the turnkey model, we had not transferred control of our equipment to our airline partner and, as a result, the airline passenger was deemed to be our customer. Transactions with our airline partners under the turnkey model were accounted for as an operating lease of space on an aircraft. We recognized $ 71.2 million and $ 28.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a reduction to our cost of service revenue from the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the Delta amendment. Under the turnkey model, the revenue share paid to our airline partners represented operating lease payments. These payments were deemed to be contingent rental payments as the payments due to each airline were based on a percentage of our CA service revenue generated from that airline’s passengers, which was unknown until realized. Therefore, we estimated the lease payments due to an airline at the commencement of our contract with such airline. This rental expense is included in cost of service revenue and is partially offset by the amortization of the deferred airborne lease incentives discussed above. Due to the accelerated amortization resulting from the Delta amendment and a significant reduction in revenue share as a result of COVID-19, the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives exceeded our revenue share expense by $ 49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We incurred net rental expense of $ 25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Asset impairment – We reviewed our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and other non-current assets, for potential impairment whenever events indicated that the carrying amount of such assets might not be recoverable. We performed this review by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. We grouped certain long-lived assets by airline contract and by technology. If we 72 determined that an impairment existed, the amount of the impairment was computed as the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its estimated fair value, following which the assets were written down to their estimated fair values. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on air travel, including decreased flights, decreased gross passenger opportunity and our airline partners’ temporary parking of a significant number of their aircraft, we conducted a review as of March 31, 2020 and determined that the carrying values for the asset groups related to three of our airline agreements for the CA business exceeded their estimated undiscounted cash flows, which triggered the need to estimate the fair value of these assets. Fair value reflects our best estimate of the discounted cash flows of the impaired assets. For the airborne assets and right-of-use assets associated with the three airline agreements (the “impaired assets”), we recorded an impairment charge of $ 46.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, reflecting the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the impaired assets. We conducted another review as of June 30, 2020 due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the signing of the Delta amendment and determined that $ 1.0 million of deferred STC costs was impaired due to the bankruptcy of three airline partners. As such, we recorded a $ 1.0 million charge for impairment of long-lived assets for the three-month period ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, charges recorded for impairments of long-lived assets totaled $ 47.4 million. No such charges were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). CA’s airline-directed contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which primarily include the sale of equipment, installation services, connectivity services and entertainment services. For these contracts, we accounted for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocated the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which was based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer, if available. To the extent a good or service was not sold separately, we used our best estimate of the standalone selling price and maximized the use of observable inputs. The primary method we used to estimate the standalone selling price was the expected cost-plus margin approach. The contractual consideration used for allocation purposes includes connectivity and entertainment services, which may be based on a fixed monthly fee per aircraft or a variable fee based on the volume of connectivity activity, or a combination of both. Examples of variable consideration within CA’s airline contracts include megabyte overages and pay-per-use sessions. We constrained our estimates to reduce the probability of a significant revenue reversal in future periods, allocated variable consideration to the identified performance obligations and recognized revenue in the period the services were provided. Our estimates were based on historical experience, anticipated future performance, market conditions and our best judgment at the time. For 2020, our estimates included management’s best assumptions for the continued impact of COVID-19, which included decreased flights and gross passenger opportunity (“GPO”). A significant change in one or more of these estimates could have affected estimated contract value. For example, estimates of variable revenue within certain contracts required estimation of the number of sessions or megabytes that would be purchased over the contract term and the average revenue per connectivity session, which varies based on the connectivity options available to passengers on each airline. Estimated revenue under these contracts anticipated increases in take rates over time and assumed an average revenue per session consistent with our historical experience. We regularly reviewed and updated our estimates, especially in light of COVID-19, and recognized adjustments under the cumulative catch-up method. Any adjustments under this method were recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period identified and revenue for future periods was recognized using the new adjusted estimate. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of 73 revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the significant estimates and bases such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Significant Risks and Uncertainties - Our operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those associated with continuing losses, fluctuations in operating results, funding of our growth, implementation of our technology roadmap, strategic alliances, relationships with customers, suppliers and dealers, financing terms that may restrict operations, regulatory issues, competition, COVID-19, the economy, technology trends and evolving industry standards. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments - We consider cash and cash equivalents to be short-term, highly liquid investments that have the following characteristics: readily convertible to known amounts of cash, so near their maturities that there is insignificant risk of changes in value due to any changes in market interest rates, and having maturities of three months or less when purchased. We continually monitor positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which we invest. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets. We consider short-term investments to be investments with maturities of twelve months or less (but greater than three months). Restricted Cash - Certain cash amounts are restricted as to use and are classified outside of cash and cash equivalents. Cash amounts with restrictions of twelve months or less are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and amounts restricted for greater than twelve months are included in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our restricted cash balances were $ 0.4 million and $ 0.5 million , respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The balance as of December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of a letter of credit issued for the benefit of the landlord of our new office location in Chicago, IL. The balance as of December 31, 2020 consisted of a letter of credit issued for the benefit of the landlord of our current office location in Broomfield, CO which was no longer required as of December 31, 2021. Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. All cash and cash equivalents are invested with creditworthy financial institutions. Income Tax - We use an asset- and liability-based approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax attributes and are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets to determine, based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of such deferred assets will not be realized. We also consider the existence of any uncertain tax positions and, as necessary, provide a reserve for any uncertain tax positions at each reporting date. See Note 16, ""Income Tax,"" for further details. Inventories - Inventories consist primarily of telecommunications systems and parts and are recorded at the lower of average cost or market. We evaluate the need for write-downs associated with obsolete, slow-moving and nonsalable inventory by reviewing net realizable inventory values on a periodic basis. See Note 6, ""Inventories,"" for further details. Property and Equipment and Depreciation - Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Network asset inventory and construction in progress, which include materials, transmission and related equipment, interest and other costs relating to the construction and development of our network, are not depreciated until they are put into service. Network equipment consists of switching equipment, antennas, base transceiver stations, site preparation costs, and other related equipment used in the operation of our network. Depreciation expense totaled $ 7.9 million , $ 7.9 million and $ 10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Subsequent to the issuance of the Company’s 2020 consolidated financial statements, the Company determined that the depreciation expense amounts disclosed in the footnotes to the 2020 Form 10-K represented both depreciation and amortization expense and thus were overstated by $ 6.3 million and $ 6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the current year, the Company corrected these disclosed depreciation expense amounts in the footnote. These disclosure adjustments did not impact the amounts recorded in the 74 consolidated financial statements and the Company believes the disclosure adjustments are not material. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for owned assets, which are as follows: Office equipment, furniture, fixtures and other 3 - 5 years Leasehold improvements 7 - 15 years Network equipment 5 - 25 years See Note 7, ""Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts,"" for further details. Improvements to leased property are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease. We reassess the useful lives of leasehold improvements when there are changes to the terms of the underlying lease. Such reassessment has resulted in the useful life of specific assets being adjusted to a shorter period than originally estimated, resulting in an increase in annual depreciation expense for those assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software Development Costs - We capitalize costs for network and non-network software developed or obtained for internal use during the application development stage. These costs include purchased software and direct costs associated with the development and configuration of internal use software that supports the operation of our service offerings. These costs are included in Intangible assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheets and, when the software is placed in service, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Costs incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. With respect to software sold as part of our equipment sales, we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility has been established. Such capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, based on the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight-line method. Intangible Assets - Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Our FCC Licenses, as defined in Note 9, ""Intangible Assets,"" are our only material indefinite-lived intangible assets. We perform our annual impairment test of our FCC Licenses during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of impairment. Our qualitative analysis includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environment, industry and market conditions, financial performance versus budget and any other events or circumstances specific to the FCC Licenses. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the FCC Licenses is greater than the carrying value, no further testing is required. If our qualitative analysis indicates more testing is required, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative analysis, we will apply the quantitative impairment test method. Our quantitative impairment testing of the FCC Licenses uses the Greenfield method, an income-based approach. When performing this quantitative impairment testing, we estimate the value of our FCC spectrum licenses by calculating the present value of the cash flows of a hypothetical new market participant whose only assets are such licenses to determine the fair value of the FCC licenses. The estimate takes into account all costs and expenses necessary to build the Company’s infrastructure during the start-up period, projected revenue, and cash flows once the infrastructure is completed. Since there is limited corroborating data available in the marketplace that would demonstrate a market participant’s experience in establishing an “air-to-ground” business, we utilize our historic results and future projections as the underlying basis for the application of the Greenfield method. We follow the traditional discounted cash flow method, calculating the present value of a new market participant’s estimated debt free cash flows, based on our historical weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect the cost of capital for a new market participant. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, projected operating results and cash flows may not always be achieved. The failure to achieve one or more of our assumptions regarding projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term could reduce the estimated fair value below carrying value and result in the recognition of an impairment charge. The results of our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments for 2021, 2020 and 2019 indicated no impairment. Intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are amortized over their useful lives as follows: Software 3 - 8 years OEM and dealer relationships 10 years Service customer relationships 5 - 7 years Other intangible assets 4 - 10 years 75 See Note 9, ""Intangible Assets,"" for further details . Long-Lived Assets - We review our long-lived assets to determine potential impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We do this by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. If we determine an impairment exists, the asset is written down to estimated fair value. There were no impairments of long-lived assets in 2021, 2020 or 2019 . Revenue Recognition - Our revenue is primarily earned from providing connectivity and entertainment services and through sales of equipment. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: Service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services and is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Equipment revenue primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of ATG and satellite connectivity equipment and the sale of entertainment equipment and is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped to OEMs and dealers. In all cases, we evaluate whether a contract exists as it relates to collectability of the contract. Once a contract is deemed to exist, we evaluate the transaction price and deliverables under the contract. A limited number of contracts contain multiple equipment and service deliverables. For these contracts, we account for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which is based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer. See Note 5, ""Revenue Recognition,"" for further information. Research and Development Costs - Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and totaled $ 24.9 million , $ 25.2 million and $ 26.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Research and development costs are reported as engineering, design and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Warranty - We provide warranties on parts and labor related to our products. Our warranty terms range from two to five years. Warranty reserves are established for costs that are estimated to be incurred after the sale, delivery and installation of the products under warranty. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence, and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, ""Composition of Certain Reserves and Allowances,"" for the details of the changes in our warranty reserve. Asset Retirement Obligations - We have certain asset retirement obligations related to contractual commitments to remove our network equipment and other assets from leased cell sites upon termination of the site leases. The asset retirement obligations are classified as a noncurrent liability in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 7, ""Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts,"" for the details of the changes in our asset retirement obligations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - We group financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value into three levels of hierarchy based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. 76 See Note 14, ""Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities,"" for further information. Derivatives - We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate borrowings. We currently use interest rate caps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes, and have designated these interest rate caps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We account for these interest rate caps in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , which requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. We record the effective portion of changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassify these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized. See Note 11, ""Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"" for further information. In March 2015, we entered into the Forward Transactions (as defined and described in Note 10, ""Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities"") in which we purchased 7.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $ 140.0 million, with an expected settlement date on or around March 13, 2020 , and in December 2019, we amended a portion of the Forward Transactions to extend the expected settlement date for approximately 2.1 million of those shares to on or around May 15, 2022 . During March 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. In April 2021, approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction (as defined and described in Note 10, ""Long-term Debt and Other Liabilities""). We accounted for these shares as Treasury stock and reclassified $ 29.9 million and $ 98.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from Additional paid-in capital to Treasury stock, at cost, in our consolidated balance sheets. Because the Forward Transactions are indexed to our own stock and classified within stockholders’ equity, we do not account for the Forward Transactions as derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . See Note 10, ""Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,"" for further information. Convertible Notes – Proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 10, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities”) were initially allocated between a liability component (Long-term debt) and an equity component (Additional paid-in capital), within the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021, the 2022 Convertible Notes are accounted for as a single liability. See ""- Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,"" for more information on the adoption of ASU 2020-06. See Note 10, ""Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,"" for further information. Earnings (Loss) Per Share - We calculate basic earnings (loss) per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. See Note 4, ""Earnings (Loss) Per Share,"" for further information. Stock-Based Compensation Expense - Compensation cost is measured and recognized at fair value for all stock-based payments, including stock options. For time-based vesting stock options, we estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur. RSUs and restricted stock are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. For awards with a market condition (which we have used on a limited basis), we estimate fair value using the Monte Carlo Simulation model, which requires assumptions, such as volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life and dividends. Our stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the applicable vesting period and is included in the same operating expense line items in the consolidated statements of operations as the base cash compensation paid to the underlying employees . See Note 15, ""Stock-Based Compensation and 401(k) Plan,"" for further information. Leases – We account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). We have operating lease agreements for which w e have recorded lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for leases primarily related to cell sites and office buildings. We determine whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception and calculate the lease liability and right-of-use asset using our incremental borrowing rate. Our cell site leases generally have terms of five to ten years , with renewal options for an additional five to 25 years . For certain cell sites, the renewal options are deemed to be reasonably certain to be 77 exercised. During the periods presented, our building leases ranged from one to ten years , with renewal options for an additional one to five years . We recognize operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have finance leases for computer and office equipment. Covenants within the Term Loan Facility contain certain restrictions on our ability to enter into new finance lease arrangements. See Note 17, ""Leases,"" for further information. Advertising Costs - Costs for advertising are expensed as incurred. Debt Issuance Costs - We defer loan origination fees and financing costs related to our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we defer fees paid directly to the lenders related to amendments of our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. We amortize these costs over the term of the underlying debt obligation using the effective interest method and include them in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The fees incurred but not paid directly to the lenders in connection with amendments are expensed as incurred to interest expense. Deferred financing costs associated with future debt issuances are written off in the period during which we determine that the debt will no longer be issued. See Note 10, ""Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,"" for further information. Comprehensive Income (Loss) - Comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021 is net income plus unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments and the changes in fair value of cash flow hedges. Comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is net loss plus unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting standards adopted: On January 1, 2021, we adopted ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain convertible instruments by removing the separation models for convertible debt with a cash conversion feature or convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The treasury stock method is no longer available. This standard is effective beginning on January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the standard requires using either a modified retrospective or a full retrospective approach. We elected to early adopt ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The cumulative impact of using the modified retrospective approach for the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on our consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2021 is summarized below: Balance at December 31, Impact of Balances with Adoption of 2020 ASU 2020-06 ASU 2020-06 Liabilities Long-term debt $ 827,968 $ 21,943 $ 849,911 Equity Additional paid-in capital $ 1,088,590 $ ( 47,423 ) $ 1,041,167 Accumulated deficit $ ( 1,629,843 ) $ 25,480 $ ( 1,604,363 ) On January 1, 2021, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12 – Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”). The amendments in ASU 2019-12 eliminate certain exceptions to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation and interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed projected losses. ASU 2019-12 also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 78 All other new pronouncements: In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance to increase the transparency of transactions with a government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. ASU 2021-10 requires an entity to disclose information about the nature of the transactions, including the significant terms and conditions, accounting policy used to account for the transactions, and the effect of the transactions on the financial statements. This guidance is effective beginning on January 1, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have upon our consolidated financial statements. 4. Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share have been calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The shares of common stock effectively repurchased in connection with the Forward Transactions (as defined and described in Note 10, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities”) are considered participating securities requiring the two-class method to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share. Net earnings will be allocated between shares of common stock and participating securities on a one-to-one basis. In periods of a net loss, the shares associated with the Forward Transactions will not receive an allocation of losses, as the counterparties to the Forward Transactions are not required to fund losses. Additionally, the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 excludes approximately 0.6 million, 2.1 million and 7.2 million shares, respectively, associated with the Forward Transactions. The diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations exclude the effect of stock options, deferred stock units, restricted stock units and convertible notes when the computation is anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the weighted average number of shares excluded from the computation was 5.7 million shares. As a result of the net loss for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, for the periods where such shares or securities were outstanding, all of the outstanding shares of common stock underlying stock options, deferred stock units, restricted stock units and convertible notes were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding because they were anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019; however, for the reasons described above, the shares associated with the Forward Transactions are excluded from the computation of basic earnings per share ( in thousands, except per share amounts ): 79 For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Income (Numerator) Shares (Denominator) Per Share Amount Net income from continuing operations $ 156,589 Less: Participation rights on Forward Transactions allocated to continuing operations 1,484 Basic Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Undistributed income from continuing operations $ 155,105 103,400 $ 1.50 Effect of Dilutive Securities from Continuing Operations Stock-based compensation — 6,674 2022 Convertible Notes 7,221 17,131 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Undistributed income from continuing operations and assumed conversions $ 162,326 127,205 $ 1.28 Net loss from discontinued operations $ ( 3,854 ) Less: Participation rights on Forward Transactions allocated to discontinued operations ( 36 ) Basic Loss Per Share from Discontinued Operations Undistributed loss from discontinued operations $ ( 3,818 ) 103,400 $ ( 0.04 ) Effect of Dilutive Securities from Discontinued Operations Stock-based compensation 3,615 6,674 2022 Convertible Notes — 17,131 Diluted Loss Per Share from Discontinued Operations Undistributed loss from discontinued operations and assumed conversions $ ( 203 ) 127,205 $ — Earnings per share - basic $ 1.46 Earnings per share - diluted $ 1.28 For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Net loss from continuing operations $ ( 48,559 ) $ ( 88,497 ) Net loss from discontinued operations ( 201,477 ) ( 57,507 ) Net loss ( 250,036 ) ( 146,004 ) Less: Participation rights of the Forward Transactions — — Undistributed losses $ ( 250,036 ) $ ( 146,004 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding-basic and diluted 82,266 80,766 Net loss attributable to common stock per share-basic and diluted: Net loss from continuing operations $ ( 0.59 ) $ ( 1.10 ) Net loss from discontinued operations ( 2.45 ) ( 0.71 ) Net loss $ ( 3.04 ) $ ( 1.81 ) 5. Revenue Recognition Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price in our customer contracts allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations was approximately $ 95 million . The remaining unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent connectivity and entertainment service revenues which are recognized as services are provided, which is expected to occur through the 80 remaining term of the contract. We have excluded from this amount consideration from contracts that have an original duration of one year or less. Disaggregation of revenue The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by category (in thousands) : For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Service revenue Connectivity $ 255,786 $ 209,160 $ 219,450 Entertainment and other 3,797 2,827 2,472 Total service revenue $ 259,583 $ 211,987 $ 221,922 Equipment revenue ATG $ 61,780 $ 45,200 $ 62,899 Satellite 11,048 11,746 21,755 Other 3,305 785 2,409 Total equipment revenue $ 76,133 $ 57,731 $ 87,063 Customer type Aircraft owner/operator/service provider $ 259,583 $ 211,987 $ 221,922 OEM and aftermarket dealer 76,133 57,731 87,063 Total revenue $ 335,716 $ 269,718 $ 308,985 Contract balances Our current and non-current deferred revenue balances totaled $ 1.8 million and $ 3.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Deferred revenue includes, among other things, fees paid for equipment and subscription connectivity products. Our current and non-current contract asset balances totaled $ 17.8 million and $ 12.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contract assets represent the aggregate amount of revenue recognized in excess of billings primarily for certain sales programs. Major Customers No customer accounted for more than 10 % of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and no customer accounted for more than 10 % of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. 6. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of telecommunications systems and parts and are recorded at the lower of average cost or market price. We evaluate the need for write-downs associated with obsolete, slow-moving and nonsalable inventory by reviewing net realizable inventory values on a periodic basis. Inventories as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2021 2020 Work-in-process component parts $ 21,570 $ 15,405 Finished goods 12,406 12,709 Total inventory $ 33,976 $ 28,114 7. Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts Prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows ( in thousands ): 81 December 31, 2021 2020 Contract assets $ 4,533 $ 2,417 Prepaid inventories 2,525 124 Insurance receivable (1) 17,300 — Tenant improvement allowance receivables 1,936 — Other 6,001 6,393 Total prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 32,295 $ 8,934 Property and equipment as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2021 2020 Office equipment, furniture, fixtures and other $ 12,759 $ 10,986 Leasehold improvements 13,545 12,012 Network equipment 142,601 139,884 168,905 162,882 Accumulated depreciation ( 105,233 ) ( 99,389 ) Property and equipment, net $ 63,672 $ 63,493 Other non-current assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2021 2020 Contract assets, net of allowances of $ 455 and $ 375 , respectively $ 13,217 $ 9,775 Interest rate cap 11,359 — Revolving credit facility deferred financing costs 1,879 — Other 1,970 1,711 Total other non-current assets $ 28,425 $ 11,486 Accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, 2021 2020 Accrued interest $ 6,231 $ 17,836 Employee compensation and benefits (1) 13,791 35,516 Litigation settlement accrual (2) 17,300 — Operating leases 7,444 8,089 Deferred gain on sale of CA business (3) — 9,400 Warranty reserve 2,450 2,400 Taxes 1,997 2,022 Network equipment 3,179 — Other 7,476 7,746 Total accrued liabilities $ 59,868 $ 83,009 Other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 consist of the following ( in thousands ): 82 December 31, 2021 2020 Asset retirement obligations $ 4,861 $ 4,401 Deferred tax liabilities — 2,108 Other 2,375 4,072 Total other non-current liabilities $ 7,236 $ 10,581 Changes in our non-current asset retirement obligations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 consist of the following ( in thousands ): Asset Retirement Obligation Balance – January 1, 2020 $ 4,093 Liabilities incurred — Liabilities settled ( 115 ) Accretion expense 416 Foreign exchange rate adjustments 7 Balance – December 31, 2020 4,401 Liabilities incurred — Liabilities settled — Accretion expense 460 Foreign exchange rate adjustments — Balance – December 31, 2021 $ 4,861 8. Composition of Certain Reserves and Allowances Credit Losses — We regularly evaluate our accounts receivable and contract assets for expected credit losses. Our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of each customer’s trade accounts receivables. Due to the short-term nature of such receivables, the estimated amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected is based on the aging of the accounts receivable balances and the financial condition of customers. Additionally, specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. Our monitoring activities include timely account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of each customer’s financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible. We apply a similar methodology to our current and non-current contract asset balances. However, due to the inherent additional risk associated with a long-term receivable, an additional provision for credit loss is applied to contract asset balances that will diminish over time as the contract nears its expiration date. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also considered the current and estimated future economic and market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in the determination of our estimated credit losses. Estimates are used to determine the expected loss allowances. Such allowances are based on management’s assessment of anticipated payment, taking into account available historical and current information as well as management’s assessment of potential future developments. We are continuously monitoring our assumptions used to determine our expected credit losses, including the impact of COVID-19, which could cause us to record additional material credit losses in future periods. Changes in our allowances for credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows ( in thousands ): 83 Other Accounts non-current Receivable assets Balance at January 1, 2020 $ 660 $ — Cumulative-effect adjustment of ASC 326 adoption 404 75 Provision for expected credit losses 771 300 Write-offs charged against the allowances ( 727 ) — Other ( 64 ) — Balance at December 31, 2020 1,044 375 Provision for expected credit losses 204 80 Write-offs charged against the allowances ( 371 ) — Other 17 — Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 894 $ 455 Warranties — We provide warranties on parts and labor related to our products. Our warranty terms range from two to five years . Warranty reserves are established for costs that are estimated to be incurred after the sale, delivery and installation of the products under warranty. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence, and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in our warranty reserve for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows ( in thousands ): Warranty Reserve Balance – January 1, 2020 $ 2,500 Accruals for warranties issued ( 7 ) Settlements and adjustments to warranties ( 93 ) Balance – December 31, 2020 2,400 Accruals for warranties issued 126 Settlements and adjustments to warranties ( 76 ) Balance – December 31, 2021 $ 2,450 9. Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are comprised of indefinite- and finite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. We own the rights to 3MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800 MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (the “3 MHz FCC License”), which is used in the operation of our ATG network, and the license for 1 MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (the “1 MHz FCC License”) acquired as part of our acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC. Together we refer to the 3 MHz FCC License and the 1 MHz FCC License as the “FCC Licenses.” The FCC Licenses were originally issued with 10-year terms and we have renewed both licenses for subsequent 10-year terms. Such licenses are subject to further renewal by the FCC, and renewals of licenses held by others have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that limit the useful life of the FCC Licenses. As a result, the FCC Licenses are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets which we do not amortize. We reevaluate the useful life of the FCC Licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Our annual impairment assessment of the FCC Licenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 indicated no impairment. Our software relates to the development of internal use software which is used to run our network and support our service offerings. Software also includes software embedded in the equipment that we sell to our customers.

Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities Long-term debt as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 Term Loan Facility $ 718,057 $ — 2024 Senior Secured Notes — 973,539 2022 Convertible Notes 102,788 215,122 Total debt 820,845 1,188,661 Less: deferred financing costs ( 16,465 ) ( 19,693 ) Less: current portion of long-term debt ( 109,620 ) ( 341,000 ) Total long-term debt $ 694,760 $ 827,968 2021 Credit Agreement On April 30, 2021, Gogo and Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (“GIH”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo) entered into a credit agreement (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) among Gogo, GIH, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, which provides for (i) a term loan credit facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $ 725.0 million, issued with a discount of 0.5 %, and (ii) a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility” and together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Facilities”) of up to $ 100.0 million, which includes a letter of credit sub-facility. The Term Loan Facility amortizes in nominal quarterly installments equal to one percent of the aggregate initial principal amount thereof per annum, with the remaining balance payable upon final maturity of the Term Loan Facility on April 30, 2028 . There are no amortization payments under the Revolving Facility, and all borrowings under the Revolving Facility mature on April 30, 2026 . 85 The Term Loan Facility bears annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH’s option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate (subject to a floor of 0.75 %) plus an applicable margin of 3.75 % or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75 %. Loans outstanding under the Revolving Facility bear annual interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at GIH’s option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate (subject to a floor of 0.00 %) plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.25 % to 3.75 % per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.25 % to 2.75 % per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. Additionally, unused commitments under the Revolving Facility are subject to a fee ranging from 0.25 % to 0.50 % per annum depending on GIH’s senior secured first lien net leverage ratio. The Facilities may be prepaid at GIH’s option at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs), subject to minimum principal payment amount requirements. Subject to certain exceptions and de minimis thresholds, the Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments in an amount equal to: The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things: incurrence of indebtedness or issuance of disqualified equity interests; incurrence or existence of liens; consolidations or mergers; activities of Gogo and any subsidiary holding a license issued by the Federal Communications Commission; investments, loans, advances, guarantees or acquisitions; asset sales; dividends or other distributions on equity; purchase, redemption or retirement of capital stock; payment or redemption of certain junior indebtedness; entry into other agreements that restrict the ability to incur liens securing the Facilities; and amendment of organizational documents; in each case subject to customary exceptions. The Revolving Facility includes a financial covenant set at a maximum senior secured first lien net leverage ratio of 7.50 :1.00, which will apply if the outstanding amount of loans and unreimbursed letter of credit drawings thereunder at the end of any fiscal quarter exceeds 35 % of the aggregate of all commitments thereunder. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, which, if any of them occurred, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the Facilities to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the Revolving Facility to be terminated. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility were used, together with cash on hand, (i) to redeem in full and pay the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) together with accrued and unpaid interest and redemption premiums and to pay fees associated with the termination of the ABL Credit Agreement (as defined below and, together with the redemption of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the “Refinancing”), and (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing and the Facilities (the “Transaction Costs”). The Revolving Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes of Gogo and its subsidiaries and was undrawn as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan Facility was $ 721.4 million , the unaccreted debt discount was $ 3.3 million and the net carrying amount was $ 718.1 million . We paid approximately $ 19.7 million of loan origination and financing costs related to the Facilities which are being accounted for as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the terms of the Facilities. Total amortization expense was $ 1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and is included in Interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2021, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Facilities was $ 17.9 million . On April 30, 2021, Gogo, GIH, and each direct and indirect wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiary of GIH (Gogo and such subsidiaries collectively, the “Guarantors”) entered into a guarantee agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) in favor of Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”), whereby GIH and the Guarantors guarantee the obligations under the Facilities and certain other secured obligations as set forth in the Guarantee Agreement, and GIH and the Guarantors entered into a collateral agreement (the “Collateral Agreement”), in favor of the Collateral Agent, whereby GIH and the Guarantors grant a 86 security interest in substantially all of their respective tangible and intangible assets (including the equity interests in each direct material wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiary owned by GIH or any Guarantor, and 65% of the equity interests in any non-U.S. subsidiary held directly by GIH or any Guarantor), subject to certain exceptions, to secure the obligations under the Facilities and certain other secured obligations as set forth in the Collateral Agreement. 2022 Convertible Notes On November 21, 2018, we issued $ 215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $ 32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $ 22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $ 237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier converted into shares of our common stock. We pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2019. Under the accounting standards applicable at the time of issuance, the $ 237.8 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between Long-term debt (the liability component) at $ 188.7 million and Additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $ 49.1 million, within the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, at maturity we must repay the principal amount at face value in cash. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2022 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 12, ""Interest Costs,"" for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 13.6 %. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was $ 237.8 million, the unaccreted debt discount was $ 22.7 million and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $ 215.1 million. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021 (see Note 3, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,"" for more information), the 2022 Convertible Notes are accounted for as a single liability. The adoption of this standard resulted in the $ 49.1 million initially recorded to Additional paid-in capital being reclassified and recorded as an increase to Long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the $ 26.5 million of accretion recognized life-to-date was reversed and recorded as a reduction to Long-term debt and a reduction to Accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets. In January 2021, $ 1.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes was converted by holders and settled through the issuance of 166,666 shares of common stock. On March 17, 2021, Gogo entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements (the “March 2021 Exchange Agreements”) with certain holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes. Pursuant to the March 2021 Exchange Agreements, such holders exchanged a total of $ 28,235,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes for 5,121,811 shares of our common stock on March 24, 2021. The negotiated exchange rate under the March 2021 Exchange Agreements was 181.40 shares of common stock per $ 1,000 principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on settlement of $ 4.4 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. On April 1, 2021, Gogo entered into a privately negotiated exchange agreement (the “GTCR Exchange Agreement”) with an affiliate of funds managed by GTCR LLC (“GTCR”). Pursuant to the GTCR Exchange Agreement, GTCR exchanged $ 105,726,000 aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes for 19,064,529 shares of our common stock on April 9, 2021. The negotiated exchange rate under the GTCR Exchange Agreement was 180.32 shares of common stock per $ 1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which resulted in a loss on settlement of $ 14.6 million, which is included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes was $ 102.8 million and was classified as Current portion of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. 87 We incurred approximately $ 8.1 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, of which $ 6.4 million and $ 1.7 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Notes. However, upon adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021, the $ 1.7 million that was initially recorded to additional paid-in capital was reclassified and recorded as deferred financing costs, with catch-up amortization of $ 1.0 million recorded to Accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred financing costs are being amortized over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $ 1.4 million, $ 1.8 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2022 Convertible Notes was $ 0.4 million and $ 2.7 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to the carrying amount of the debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 12, ""Interest Costs,"" for additional information. The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 common shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 6.00 per share of our common stock. I n November 2021, we informed the trustee under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes that we intend to settle any conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes occurring after November 15, 2021 in shares of our common stock . The shares of common stock subject to conversion are considered in the diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method if their impact is dilutive. Holders may convert the 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amount at any time prior to January 15, 2022, but only in the following circumstances: The Stock Price Condition was triggered for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2021, April 1, 2021 through June 30, 2021, July 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021 and October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2022 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after January 15, 2022 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2022. In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2022 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Forward Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 3.75 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the ""2020 Convertible Notes""), we paid approximately $ 140.0 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the “Forward Transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “Forward Counterparties”), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to one of the Forward Transactions (the “Amended and Restated Forward Transaction”) to extend the expected settlement date with respect to approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock held by one of the Forward Counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the “2022 Forward Counterparty”), to correspond with the May 15, 2022 maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. In the future, we may request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the 2022 Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the 2022 Forward 88 Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The 2022 Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the 2022 Forward Counterparty on such terms as may be mutually agreed upon at the time. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders’ equity within our consolidated balance sheets was reduced by approximately $ 140.0 million. In March, 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. In April 2021, approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. The approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transactions are treated as retired shares for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding. 2024 Senior Secured Notes On April 25, 2019, GIH and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo Finance” and, together with GIH, the “Issuers”) issued $ 905.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875 % senior secured notes due 2024 (the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”), at a price equal to 99.512 % of their face value, under an indenture, dated as of April 25, 2019, among the Issuers, Gogo, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. On May 7, 2019, the Issuers issued an additional $ 20.0 million of 2024 Senior Secured notes, which were issued at a price equal to 100.5 % of their face value, and $ 50.0 million of 2024 Senior Secured Notes on November 13, 2020, which were issued at a price equal to 103.5 % of their face value. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Gogo and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Gogo Finance), subject to certain exceptions. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees were secured by certain liens on the Company’s collateral, which were released upon the closing of the Transaction. As of December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $ 975.0 million, the unaccreted debt discount was $ 1.5 million and the net carrying amount was $ 973.5 million. We paid approximately $ 22.6 million of origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, which were accounted for as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheets and were being amortized over the contractual term of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $ 1.4 million, $ 3.7 million and $ 2.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $ 16.6 million and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. The remaining unamortized deferred financing costs were written off as of May 1, 2021. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were redeemed on May 1, 2021 (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price equal to 104.938 % of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the Redemption Date. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $ 48.1 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $ 15.2 million and the remaining debt discount of $ 1.3 million, which together are included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. ABL Credit Facility On August 26, 2019, Gogo, GIH and Gogo Finance entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) with the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent, which provided for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”) of up to $ 30 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. The obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement were guaranteed by Gogo and all of its existing and future subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions and secured by collateral of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the facility was undrawn. On April 30, 2021, the ABL Credit Agreement and all commitments thereunder were terminated. As a result of the termination, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $ 0.3 million were written off as of May 1, 2021 and included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. 89 2022 Senior Secured Notes On June 14, 2016, the Issuers issued $ 525 million aggregate principal amount of 12.500 % senior secured notes due 2022 (the “2022 Senior Secured Notes”) under an indenture, dated as of June 14, 2016, among the Issuers, Gogo, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and as collateral agent. On January 3, 2017, the Issuers issued an additional $ 65 million of 2022 Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 108 % of their face value. On September 25, 2017, the Issuers issued an additional $ 100 million of 2022 Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 113 % of their face value. On May 15, 2019, the Issuers redeemed in full all $ 690 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $ 51.4 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $ 9.1 million and the remaining debt premium of $ 11.7 million relating to the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in connection with the redemption thereof, which together are included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. Total amortization expense was $ 0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs were written off as of May 15, 2019. 2020 Convertible Notes On March 3, 2015, we issued $ 340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $ 60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $ 21.9 million was subsequently exercised during March 2015, resulting in a total issuance of $ 361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes. In November 2018, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we repurchased $ 199.9 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes at par value. On April 18, 2019, we commenced a cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase any and all of the outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for an amount equal to $ 1,000 per $ 1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date on the 2020 Convertible Notes to, but not including, the date of payment for the 2020 Convertible Notes accepted in the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer expired on May 15, 2019, resulting in the purchase of $ 159.0 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. As a result of the Tender Offer, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $ 8.5 million to face value and unamortized deferred financing costs of $ 0.6 million were expensed. These two items are included in Loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of convertible notes in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. During September 2019, we purchased an additional $ 0.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes matured on March 1, 2020. We incurred approximately $ 10.4 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, of which $ 7.5 million and $ 2.9 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2020 Convertible Notes and under the accounting standards applicable at the time of issuance. The $ 7.5 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheets was being amortized over the term of the 2020 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was $ 0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The shares of common stock subject to conversion were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. 11. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate borrowings. We currently use interest rate caps to manage our exposure to interest rate changes, and have designated these interest rate caps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the earnings impact of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded upon the recognition of the variable interest payments related to the hedged debt. In May 2021, we purchased interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 650.0 million for $ 8.6 million. The cost of the interest rate caps will be amortized to interest expense using the caplet method, from the effective date through termination date. We receive payments in the amount calculated pursuant to the caps for any period in which the three-month USD LIBOR rate increases beyond the applicable strike rate . The notional amounts of the interest rate caps periodically decrease over the life of the caps. 90 The notional amounts, strike rates and end dates of the cap agreements are as follows (notional amounts in thousands) : Start Date End Date Notional Amounts Strike Rate 7/31/2021 7/31/2023 $ 650,000 0.75 % 7/31/2023 7/31/2024 525,000 0.75 % 7/31/2024 7/31/2025 350,000 1.25 % 7/31/2025 7/31/2026 250,000 2.25 % 7/31/2026 7/31/2027 200,000 2.75 % We record the effective portion of changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and subsequently reclassify these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized. The amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense in the event the hedges are no longer considered effective, in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging . No gains or losses of our cash flow hedges were considered to be ineffective and reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021 . We estimate that approximately $ 0.2 million currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months. We assess the effectiveness of the hedge on an ongoing basis. Cash flows from interest rate caps are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flows as investing activities from continuing operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an unrealized gain on the interest rate caps of $ 2.7 million, net of tax of $ 0.9 million. When derivatives are used, we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties; however, non-performance is not anticipated. ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values of the interest rate derivatives are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments from commercial banks (based on significant observable inputs - Level 2 inputs). The following table presents the fair value of our interest rate derivatives included in the consolidated balance sheets for the periods presented (in thousands): December 31, Derivatives designated as hedging instruments Balance sheet location 2021 2020 Current portion of interest rate caps Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 925 $ — Non-current portion of interest rate caps Other non-current assets $ 11,359 $ — Fair Value Measurement Our derivative assets and liabilities consist principally of interest rate caps, which are carried at fair value based on significant observable inputs (Level 2 inputs). Derivatives entered into by us are typically executed over-the-counter and are valued using discounted cash flows along with fair value models that primarily use market observable inputs. These models take into account a variety of factors including, where applicable, maturity, interest rate yield curves, and counterparty credit risks. 12. Interest Costs We capitalize a portion of our interest on funds borrowed during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The following is a summary of our interest costs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Interest costs charged to expense $ 62,390 $ 105,988 $ 110,502 Amortization of deferred financing costs 4,661 5,892 5,260 Accretion of debt discount 419 13,907 15,729 Amortization of interest rate cap premium 2 — — Amortization of debt premium — — ( 1,018 ) Interest expense 67,472 125,787 130,473 Interest costs capitalized to property and equipment 4 — 11 Interest costs capitalized to software 311 885 608 Total interest costs $ 67,787 $ 126,672 $ 131,092 91 13. Common Stock and Preferred Stock Common Stock – We have one class of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our common stock is junior to our preferred stock, if and when issued. Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes a total of 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $ 0.0001 per share. Preferred Stock – Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 100,000,000 shares of new preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.01 per share. No shares of this new preferred stock have been issued. The preferred stock may be issued, from time to time, in one or more series as authorized by the Board of Directors, which has the authority to designate the terms of any series of preferred stock issued, including, without limitation, the number of shares to be included in such series of preferred stock, any dividend, redemption, conversion rights or voting powers and the designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights. Shareholder Rights Plan – On September 23, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, outstanding on the record date of October 2, 2020, to the stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Preferred Shares”) at a price of $ 38.40 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right, subject to adjustment. The purpose of the Rights Agreement is to facilitate the Company’s ability to preserve its net operating losses (“NOLs”) and certain other tax attributes in order to be able to offset potential future income taxes for federal income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOLs and other tax attributes would be substantially limited if it experiences an “ownership change,” as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). A company generally experiences an ownership change if the percentage of the value of its stock owned by certain “5-percent shareholders,” as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. The Rights Agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code by deterring any person or group from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the shares of the Company’s common stock then-outstanding. Initially, the Rights will be attached to all shares of the Company’s common stock. Until the Distribution Date (as defined below), the Rights will be transferred with and only with the common stock. As long as the Rights are attached to the common stock, the Company will issue one Right with each new share of common stock so that all such shares of common stock will have Rights attached (subject to certain limited exceptions). The Rights will separate and begin trading separately from the common stock, and Right certificates will be caused to evidence the Rights, on the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the tenth day following public disclosure of facts indicating that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the outstanding common stock (an “Acquiring Person”) (or, in the event the Board of Directors determines to effect an exchange in accordance with Section 24 of the Rights Agreement and the Board of Directors determines that a later date is advisable, then such later date) and (ii) the close of business on the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 4.9% or more of the outstanding common stock (the earlier of such dates, the “Distribution Date”). The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which the Board of Directors determines in its sole discretion that (x) the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of material valuable NOLs or tax attributes or (y) the NOLs and tax attributes have been fully utilized and may no longer be carried forward and (ii) the close of business on September 23, 2023. The Rights Agreement was approved by the Company's stockholders at the Company's 2021 annual meeting of stockholders. 92 14. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Refer to Note 11, ""Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"" for fair value information relating to our interest rate caps. Long-Term Debt: As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our financial assets and liabilities that are disclosed but not measured at fair value include the Term Loan Facility, the 2022 Convertible Notes, and, while outstanding, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets at cost. The fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since they are based on quoted market prices of our instruments in markets that are not active. We estimated the fair value of the Term Loan Facility, the 2022 Convertible Notes, and, while outstanding, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume these obligations. The upfront cash payments used in the calculations of fair value on our December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheets, excluding any issuance costs, are the amount that a market participant would be willing to lend at December 31, 2021 to an entity with a credit rating similar to ours and that would allow such an entity to achieve sufficient cash inflows to cover the scheduled cash outflows under the Term Loan Facility and the 2022 Convertible Notes. The calculated fair value of the 2022 Convertible Notes is correlated to our stock price and as a result, significant changes to our stock price could have a significant impact on the calculated fair values. The fair value and carrying value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in thousands) : December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Fair Value (1) Carrying Value Fair Value (1) Carrying Value Term Loan Facility $ 723,000 $ 718,057 (2) $— $— 2022 Convertible Notes $ 230,000 $ 102,788 $ 404,000 $ 215,122 (3) 2024 Senior Secured Notes $— $— $ 1,045,000 $ 973,539 (4) 15. Stock-Based Compensation and 401(k) Plan As of December 31, 2021 , we maintained three stock-based incentive compensation plans: the Amended and Restated Gogo Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Omnibus Plan”), the Gogo Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2013 Omnibus Plan”), and The Aircell Holdings Inc. Stock Option Plan, collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans,” as well as an ESPP, as defined and discussed below. Our Stock Plans provide for the grant of both equity and cash awards, including non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards (shares and units), restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), deferred share units (“DSUs”) and other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents to eligible employees, directors and consultants, as determined by the Compensation Committee. Under the Stock Plans, 27,709,128 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. As of December 31, 2021 , 3,364,627 shares remained available for grant under our Stock Plans. The contractual life of granted options is 10 years . Except as otherwise approved by the Compensation Committee, all options that are unvested as of the date on which a recipient’s employment terminates, as well as vested options that are not exercised within a prescribed period following termination, are forfeited and become available 93 for future grants. Options granted beginning in 2010 but prior to the Option Exchange (as defined below) include options that (a) vest in specified increments over a four-year period, (b) vest on the date of grant for certain options granted to non-employee members of our Board of Directors or (c) vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant for certain options granted to non-employee members of our Board of Directors. In June 2020, we consummated an option exchange program that was approved by our stockholders at the annual meeting held on April 29, 2020 in which previously outstanding eligible options (which excluded options granted for service by non-executive members of our Board of Directors) to purchase 6,664,773 shares of common stock were surrendered and cancelled and we granted replacement options (the “Replacement Options”) in exchange for the tendered options. Of the 4,168,455 options we granted in 2020, 2,896,383 were Replacement Options. The Replacement Options vest in a single installment on December 31, 2022. Beginning in 2013, we granted RSUs, some of which vest in equal annual increments over a four-year period and others in one installment on December 31, 2022. Vested RSUs will be settled, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, in shares of our common stock or in cash equal to the value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock on the vesting date. We also granted DSUs to directors, some of which vest on the grant date and others on the first anniversary of the grant date. DSUs will be settled in shares of our common stock 90 days after the director ceases to serve as a director. Beginning in 2014, we granted restricted stock, which vests in equal annual increments over a four-year period. These shares are deemed issued as of the date of grant, but not outstanding until they vest. We intend to settle RSU, DSU and restricted stock awards in stock and we have the shares available to do so. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the Compensation Committee approved grants of both non-market-based awards that time vested as described above, and market-based awards. The market-based awards vested based on achieving one or more predetermined market conditions and completion of the same time-based vesting requirements applicable to the non-market-based awards. In 2020, the market-based awards granted in 2016 expired without the market-based condition having been achieved and the Compensation Committee approved removing the market-based vesting conditions in the awards granted in 2017, 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there are no awards that contain market-based conditions. The following is a summary of our stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations, excluding the stock-based compensation expense for discontinued operations, for the years December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands) : 2021 2020 2019 Cost of service revenue $ 472 $ 119 $ 118 Cost of equipment revenue 523 235 275 Engineering, design and development 1,358 560 601 Sales and marketing 1,615 880 1,233 General and administrative 9,377 6,014 6,427 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 13,345 $ 7,808 $ 8,654 A summary of stock option activity (which includes amounts for both continuing and discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows: Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Options outstanding – January 1, 2021 5,446,668 $ 4.19 7.33 $ 32,458 Granted 26,726 $ 9.66 Exercised ( 591,930 ) $ 3.01 Forfeited ( 12,897 ) $ 2.91 Expired ( 66,225 ) $ 17.78 Options outstanding – December 31, 2021 4,802,342 $ 4.18 6.57 $ 45,927 Options exercisable – December 31, 2021 2,669,860 $ 5.35 5.16 $ 22,874 As of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options were approximately $ 1 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.2 years . The total grant date fair value of stock options vested in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $ 10 million , $ 16 million and $ 8 million, respectively. 94 We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Weighted average assumptions used and weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Approximate risk-free interest rate 1.0 % 0.5 % 2.3 % Average expected life (years) 5.50 6.20 6.02 Dividend yield N/A N/A N/A Volatility 77.0 % 66.8 % 60.5 % Weighted average grant date fair value of common stock underlying options granted $ 9.66 $ 2.59 $ 4.71 Weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted $ 6.22 $ 1.56 $ 2.69 The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the term that mirrored the expected term in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of our stock options was determined based upon a simplified assumption that the stock options will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life. The dividend yield was based on expected dividends at the time of grant. Beginning in 2020, we calculated volatility based exclusively on our common stock. The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs and DSUs (which includes amounts for both continuing and discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2021: Number of Underlying Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested – January 1, 2021 3,448,169 $ 3.80 Granted 2,751,436 $ 10.06 Vested ( 1,940,374 ) $ 4.51 Forfeited/canceled ( 260,543 ) $ 6.79 Unvested – December 31, 2021 3,998,688 $ 7.40 As of December 31, 2021, there was approximately $ 21 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.5 years. The total grant date fair value of RSUs and DSUs vested in 2021 was approximately $ 9 million . The following table summarizes the activity for our restricted stock (which includes amounts for both continuing and discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2021: Number of Underlying Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested – January 1, 2021 18,227 $ 12.26 Granted — $ — Vested ( 18,227 ) $ 12.26 Forfeited/canceled — $ — Unvested – December 31, 2021 — $ — As of December 31, 2021 , there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee restricted stock. ESPP - In June 2013, the Board of Directors and stockholders approved the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which became effective on June 26, 2013, and in 2017 and 2020, the ESPP was amended to increase the number of shares reserved thereunder. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of common stock during pre-specified offering periods at a discount established by the Compensation Committee which may not exceed 15 % of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period (whichever is lower). Under the ESPP, 2,200,000 shares were reserved for issuance and 48,560 shares of common stock were issued during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021 , 766,580 shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP. 95 401(k) Plan - Under our 401(k) plan, all employees who are eligible to participate are entitled to make tax-deferred contributions, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. We match 100 % of the employee’s first 4 % of contributions made, subject to annual limitations. Our matching contributions were $ 1.8 million , $ 1.5 million, and $ 1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 16. Income Tax For financial reporting purposes, the loss from continuing operations before income taxes included the following components for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 United States $ ( 27,557 ) $ ( 45,840 ) $ ( 85,806 ) Foreign ( 3,084 ) ( 2,865 ) ( 2,128 ) Loss before income taxes $ ( 30,641 ) $ ( 48,705 ) $ ( 87,934 ) Significant components of the (benefit) provision for income taxes for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Current: Federal $ — $ — $ — State 90 86 385 Foreign — — — 90 86 385 Deferred: Federal ( 166,706 ) ( 318 ) 91 State ( 20,614 ) 86 87 ( 187,320 ) ( 232 ) 178 Total $ ( 187,230 ) $ ( 146 ) $ 563 The (benefit) provision for income taxes for continuing operations differs from income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 as a result of the following items: For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Effect of: Impact of change in tax rate — — ( 0.1 ) Change in valuation allowance 595.5 ( 48.9 ) ( 25.1 ) State income taxes-net of federal tax benefit 3.2 14.0 6.9 R&D credit 8.3 — — Loss on settlement of 2022 Convertible Notes ( 12.9 ) — — Other ( 4.1 ) 14.2 ( 3.1 ) Effective tax rate 611.0 % 0.3 % ( 0.6 )% 96 Components of the net deferred income tax asset as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 Deferred income tax assets: Compensation accruals $ 2,492 $ 7,618 Stock options 7,839 23,263 Inventory 823 1,784 Warranty reserves 609 599 Fixed assets 5,821 — Capital loss 10,425 17,712 Deferred revenue 184 315 Federal net operating loss (NOL) 144,591 135,806 State NOL 29,690 25,896 Foreign NOL 15,478 18,374 Interest carryforward 71,778 66,379 UNICAP adjustment 1,070 1,733 Finite-lived intangible assets 3,374 4,748 Operating lease liability 21,118 11,539 R&D credit 2,538 — Other 4,983 7,671 Total deferred income tax assets 322,813 323,437 Deferred income tax liabilities: Fixed assets — ( 8,673 ) Indefinite-lived intangible assets ( 8,043 ) ( 7,619 ) Convertible Notes discount — ( 5,512 ) Right-of-use asset ( 17,684 ) ( 8,435 ) Interest rate cap valuation ( 909 ) — Other ( 324 ) ( 1,924 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities ( 26,960 ) ( 32,163 ) Total deferred income tax 295,853 291,274 Valuation allowance ( 110,720 ) ( 293,382 ) Net deferred income tax asset (liability) $ 185,133 $ ( 2,108 ) We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance related to our deferred income tax assets to determine, based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of such deferred assets will not be realized. In our assessments, the Company considers recent financial operating results, the scheduled expiration of our net operating losses, potential sources of taxable income, the reversal of existing taxable differences, taxable income in prior carryback years, if permitted under tax law, and tax planning strategies. Based on our most recent assessment, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we released $ 195.8 million of the valuation allowance for the portion of our deferred income tax assets that we are more likely than not going to utilize. As of December 31, 2021, we can demonstrate an estimate of objectively verifiable future income based on the prior three years of pre-tax income from continuing operations, adjusted for the change in interest expense resulting from the Refinancing. This estimate of future income, along with our assessment of the other positive and negative evidence considered, supports the release of a portion of the valuation allowance. The remaining valuation allowance is still required for deferred tax assets related to certain state and foreign NOLs, capital losses, and the Section 163(j) interest limitation carryforward as it was more likely than not as of December 31, 2021 that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we continue to sustain our current operating performance, additional reversals of our valuation allowance could occur within the next twelve to eighteen months. As of December 31, 2021, the federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward amount was approximately $ 689 million and the state NOL carryforward amount was approximately $ 523 million . The federal NOLs begin to expire in 2031. The state NOLs expire in various tax years beginning in 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the Canadian NOL carryforward amount was approximately $ 58 million, and it will begin to expire in 2032. Utilization of our NOL, interest carryforward and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The interest carryforward arises from U.S. Tax Reform and generally limits the interest expense deduction to 30 % of EBITDA for tax years 2018 to 2021 and 30 % of EBIT for 2022 97 and subsequent years. The interest carryforward will not expire as it may be carried forward indefinitely. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50 % over a three-year period. As of December 31,2021, 2020 and 2019 , we did no t have any unrecognized tax benefits. We are subject to taxation and file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and many states and Canada. With few exceptions, as of December 31, 2021, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2017. We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision line item in the consolidated statement of operations. No penalties or interest related to uncertain tax positions were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , we did no t have a liability recorded for interest or potential penalties. We do no t expect a change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. 17. Leases The following is a summary of our lease expense included in the consolidated statement of operations (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 13,203 $ 11,688 $ 11,676 Finance lease cost: Amortization of leased assets 35 230 665 Interest on lease liabilities 50 113 56 Total lease cost $ 13,288 $ 12,031 $ 12,397 Other information regarding our leases is as follows (in thousands, except lease terms and discount rates) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Supplemental cash flow information Cash paid for amounts included in measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows used in operating leases $ 13,930 $ 12,733 $ 13,059 Operating cash flows used in finance leases $ 51 $ 113 $ 56 Financing cash flows used in finance leases $ 145 $ 546 $ — Non-cash items: Operating leases obtained $ 43,148 $ 5,342 $ 4,197 Finance leases obtained $ — $ 428 $ 1,268 Weighted average remaining lease term Operating leases 9 years 7 years 8 years Finance leases 2 years 2 years 3 years Weighted average discount rate Operating leases 7.0 % 11.2 % 10.3 % Finance leases 18.6 % 10.5 % 8.3 % 98 Annual future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands) : Years ending December 31, Operating Leases Financing Leases 2022 $ 12,815 $ 156 2023 12,698 91 2024 12,043 — 2025 11,249 — 2026 11,184 — Thereafter 53,914 — Total future minimum lease payments 113,903 247 Less: Amount representing interest ( 29,130 ) ( 31 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments $ 84,773 $ 216 Reported as of December 31, 2021 Accrued liabilities $ 7,444 $ 129 Non-current operating lease liabilities 77,329 — Other non-current liabilities — 87 Total lease liabilities $ 84,773 $ 216 As of December 31, 2021 , there were no significant leases which had not yet commenced. 18. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Commitments - We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase hardware components and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the hardware components or as development services are provided. Indemnifications and Guarantees - In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of the performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. Linksmart Litigation - On April 20, 2018 , Linksmart Wireless Technology, LLC filed suit against Gogo Inc., Gogo LLC, our former subsidiary and the entity that operated our CA business (“Gogo LLC”), and eight CA airline partners in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that CA’s redirection server and login portal infringe a patent owned by the plaintiff. The suits sought an unspecified amount of damages. Intelsat is required under its contracts with these airlines, which it assumed in the Transaction, to indemnify them for defense costs and any liabilities resulting from the suit. In November 2021, the plaintiff, the successor to Gogo LLC and Gogo Inc. entered into a settlement agreement which included no payment or other obligation on our part other than a release of plaintiff from any claims related to the litigation or the patent at issue. In December 2021, the court dismissed the suit with prejudice. Securities Litigation - On June 27, 2018 , a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division styled Pierrelouis v. Gogo Inc., naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, its current Chief Financial Officer and its then-current President, Commercial Aviation as defendants purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our securities from February 27, 2017 through May 4, 2018. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, alleging misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to the reliability 99 of and installation and remediation costs associated with CA’s 2Ku antenna. The plaintiffs seek to recover from us and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages. In December 2018 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and in February 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss such amended complaint. In October 2019 the judge granted the motion to dismiss on two independent grounds, finding that plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that defendants made materially false or misleading statements and that plaintiffs failed to plead with particularity that defendants acted with scienter. The amended complaint was dismissed without prejudice, and in December 2019, defendants filed a second amended complaint. In July 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting leave to file a proposed third amended complaint, which was granted by the Court. Plaintiffs proceeded to file the third amended complaint in July 2020 and we filed a motion to dismiss in September 2020. In April 2021, the Court denied our motion to dismiss, and the defendants filed their answer and affirmative defenses to the third amended complaint in June 2021. The parties engaged in mediation and reached a tentative resolution that includes a cash payment of $ 17.3 million (to be funded by our Directors' and Officers' insurance policy) in exchange for a dismissal with prejudice of the class claims and full releases. As a result of this development, the Company has accrued a $ 17.3 million liability within Accrued liabilities and a corresponding insurance receivable in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021. This resolution is subject to execution by the parties of a definitive settlement agreement and final approval by the court. While the Company will in good faith negotiate the terms of the definitive settlement agreement and seek court approval, there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in a settlement or, if they do, as to the timing of such settlement. We believe that the claims are without merit and will continue to defend them vigorously should the parties’ settlement efforts be unsuccessful. Derivative Litigation - On September 25, 2018 and September 26, 2018 , two purported stockholders of the Company filed substantively identical derivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, styled Nanduri v. Gogo Inc. and Hutsenpiller v. Gogo Inc., respectively. Both lawsuits were purportedly brought derivatively on behalf of us and name us as a nominal defendant and name as defendants each member of the Company’s Board of Directors, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and allege misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to the 2Ku antenna’s reliability and installation and remediation costs, as well as allegedly excessive bonuses, stock options, and other compensation paid to current Officers and Directors and excessive severance paid to former Officers. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on our behalf, an unspecified amount of damages from the individual defendants. The two lawsuits were consolidated and were stayed pending a final disposition of the motion to dismiss in the class action suit and remain stayed. In addition, a purported stockholder has sent a letter to the Company’s Board of Directors, dated June 21, 2021, demanding based on substantially the same allegations, that the Company sue certain current and former Officers for, inter alia , breach of fiduciary duty. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. No amounts have been accrued for any potential costs under these matters, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome or the potential costs. We have filed a claim under our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy with respect to these suits and the demand from the purported stockholder. We expect any material financial exposure for these matters to be borne by our insurance carriers, although they have reserved their rights under the policies. SmartSky Litigation - On February 28, 2022, SmartSky Networks, LLC brought suit against Gogo Inc. and its subsidiary Gogo Business Aviation LLC in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Gogo 5G infringes four patents owned by the plaintiff. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages as well as treble damages for alleged willful infringement and asks that the Court temporarily and permanently enjoin defendants from infringing the patents at issue. We believe that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit and intend to defend our position vigorously. The outcome of this litigation is inherently uncertain. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material adverse impact on our company due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted, which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as damages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs. 19.

Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2021 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021. (b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Gogo Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a – 15(f) and 15d – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Gogo’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The management of Gogo, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have assessed the effectiveness of Gogo’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, the Company’s management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, which report is included on Page 105 of this Form 10-K under the caption entitled “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no material changes to our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information None. Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections Not applicable. 104 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Gogo Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Gogo Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated March 3, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Chicago, Illinois March 3, 2022 105 Part III Item 10.

Business Who We Are Gogo is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. We have served this market for more than 20 years. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every passenger on every business aviation flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated air-to-ground (“ATG”) networks and engineer, install and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software. We hold the exclusive license to 4MHz of U.S. nationwide spectrum dedicated to air-to-ground use, as well as exclusive rights to the same spectrum in Canada. We offer our customers a broad suite of integrated equipment, network and Internet connectivity products and services as well as global support capabilities. Our offerings include a customizable suite of smart cabin systems for highly integrated connectivity, in-flight entertainment and voice solutions. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 5,800 ATG business aircraft online of which approximately 1,700 were equipped with our AVANCE platform and approximately 4,100 with Gogo Biz, our legacy ATG broadband system. AVANCE is a software-centric platform that enables us to offer a broad range of products and features and employ multiple spectrum frequencies and networks as new technologies emerge. Of the AVANCE aircraft online at December 31, 2020, approximately 1,200 were equipped with AVANCE L5 TM and approximately 500 with AVANCE L3™, a compact version of AVANCE L5 modified for small business aircraft. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 700 paid subscribers to Gogo Vision, our in-flight video on demand entertainment service. As of such date, we also had approximately 4,700 aircraft online equipped with narrow band satellite solutions that we provide pursuant to distribution agreements with satellite providers. We continually innovate to maintain our leading global market share and support our customers’ needs, and in May 2019, we announced our plans to build our Gogo 5G network for use on business aviation aircraft, commercial regional jets and smaller mainline jets operating within the continental United States and Canada. We expect the new network to be deployed on a nationwide basis in 2022. Gogo 5G will support licensed and unlicensed spectrum and allow us to take advantage of new advances in technology as they are developed. We will continue to provide 3G and 4G service over our ATG networks in North America to augment performance and provide redundancy to the Gogo 5G network. Our technology roadmap includes plans for continued rapid improvement in the performance of our in-flight systems. Our Customers and Distribution Partners Our end users are primarily aircraft owners/operators in the business aviation market. As of December 31, 2020, our market was comprised of approximately 23,800 business aircraft in North America, of which approximately 30% have broadband connectivity, and approximately 14,500 business aircraft in the rest of the world, of which fewer than 6% have broadband connectivity. We sell directly to every Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) of business aviation aircraft including Bombardier, Dassault Falcon, Embraer, Gulfstream, Pilatus and Textron Aviation. In the aftermarket, we sell through a global distribution network of approximately 120 independent dealers who are certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) as aircraft Maintenance and Repair Organizations (“MROs”). Our dealers market, resell and obtain FAA-required Supplemental Type Certificates (“STCs”) for our equipment. Our customers also include fractional jet operators such as Flexjet and NetJets, charter operators such as Wheels Up, corporate flight departments, and individuals. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 4,000 customers, none of which accounted for more than 5% of our revenue from continuing operations in 2020. Upon the closing of the Transaction, we and Intelsat entered into a network sharing agreement (the “ATG Network Sharing Agreement”), pursuant to which we provide certain inflight connectivity services on our ATG network to Intelsat, subject to certain revenue sharing obligations, and pursuant to which Intelsat has exclusive commercial aviation access to the ATG network in North America, subject to certain revenue guarantees. As of December 31, 2020, our ATG network was accessible to more than 1,300 commercial aircraft, primarily regional jets, operated by Intelsat’s airline customers. 4 Our In-flight Internet Portfolio We focus exclusively on aviation and implement our value proposition of offering the best products and services through a comprehensive portfolio consisting of our in-flight network, in-flight systems, in-flight services, aviation partner support and production operations functions. In-flight Network . Our network solutions are engineered to provide industry-leading cost, capacity, coverage, reliability and aero-performance. We offer business aviation partners a variety of network solutions suitable for operation on most of the world’s business aircraft and one or more of our systems are line fit offerable on the vast majority of aircraft models manufactured by our OEM distribution partners. Our terrestrial network targets approximately 23,800 business aircraft based in North America. Such aircraft generally fly over land and are well-suited for our ATG solutions given their need for smaller antennas, lighter weight equipment and reduced equipment and operating costs. • North American Terrestrial Network : We operate a terrestrial network using 3 MHz of licensed spectrum in the 800 MHz band and approximately 260 terrestrial cell sites in the lower 48 states and parts of Alaska and Canada. All but one of our cell sites are leased from tower operators. As of December 31, 2020, this network supported 3.1 Mbps 3G service and 9.8 Mbps 4G service. We are currently building our Gogo 5G network, which we expect to be deployed on a nationwide basis in 2022. • Ground Network : We lease an extensive, predominantly fiber-optic network to connect our approximately 260 cell sites to our two data centers, the Internet and cloud-based services, and our network operations center (“NOC”). Our data centers and cloud-based services provide redundant telecommunications connections to the Internet and contain numerous servers that enable the expansive set of features that we offer. The NOC monitors daily network operations, conducts network diagnostics and coordinates responses to any performance issues. We augment our ability to monitor, maintain and update our in-flight systems while aircraft are on the ground with a terrestrial modem utilizing 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi wireless service. In-flight Systems . To utilize our in-flight network and provide our in-flight services, we have developed proprietary systems of airborne equipment and software. Our in-flight systems are designed for superior performance, future adaptability and ease of certification, installation and maintenance. Each system consists of: (i) an antenna specifically designed for the network and technology being used to provide the service; (ii) a modular in-cabin Wi-Fi network that includes state-of-the art servers, modems and wireless access points; and (iii) system software designed to reliably support a variety of in-flight services provided by Gogo, our aviation partners and third parties. The flexibility of the AVANCE platform provides significant benefits both to customers and Gogo operations. AVANCE provides customers with a common software platform that operates across all Gogo networks and allows aviation partners to customize their passengers’ in-flight experiences by selecting from a variety of offerings that include various levels of connectivity; on-demand entertainment; information and applications; smart cabin customization; and real-time support and tools. The flexibility of the AVANCE platform enables aircraft owners and operators to add or reduce system capabilities as their needs change. AVANCE is designed with a flexible architecture and common componentry across all devices to facilitate equipment standardization and allow Gogo to add multiple products and features, augment spectrum and employ multiple ATG or satellite networks with minimal or no changes to installed hardware or the aircraft. In-flight Services . We provide a wide range of in-flight services for passengers, flight and cabin crews and operational use by our aviation partners. • Passenger Connectivity Services: Passengers connect to the Internet from their personal electronic devices, as they would on the ground, to access corporate and personal applications that include streaming services on our higher capacity networks. We offer a variety of connectivity services tailored to our various networks and technologies that are generally priced on a per aircraft per month basis. • Passenger Entertainment Services : Through Gogo Vision, our video-on-demand product accessible from passengers’ personal electronic devices, passengers can access a large library of entertainment options, which currently include on-demand movies and television shows. Content is wirelessly updated each month through Gogo Cloudport, either in the customer’s own hanger or at Gogo Cloud locations in 5 the Unites States and Europe. In December 2020, we launched Gogo Vision 360, a premium IFE service that includes unlimited on-demand movies and television shows along with digital magazines and a state-of-the art 3D moving map. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 700 paid subscribers to Gogo Vision . Aviation Partner Support . • Account Team . We have a customer operations team that assists our dealers with installation, troubleshooting and system activations, and our customers’ flight departments are supported by field service engineering teams located at key locations across the United States and Europe. Both the dealer network and customer flight departments have access to our technical and logistical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. • Operational Support . We provide a variety of services required to install and maintain our in-flight systems. Our OEM distribution partners and our dealers are responsible for obtaining the FAA certifications required for installation of our equipment on aircraft, and we support them in obtaining such certifications and installing the equipment. Following installation, our NOC continually monitors the network and its usage and performance. • Comprehensive Analytics . We have extensive databases, a big data platform and analytical capabilities to evaluate our system and operational performance. Our analytical capabilities are used by us, our aviation partners and our vendors in designing, manufacturing, and operating our systems to maximize performance and minimize disruptions and system downtime. Engineering, Design and Development . We employ a large in-house Engineering, Design and Development (“ED&D”) organization. ED&D is responsible for translating business requirements into products that comply with rigorous avionics certification requirements. Its capabilities include: (i) a radiofrequency engineering team with expertise in antenna specifications, radio technology, spectrum analysis, network design and regulatory requirements; (ii) an airborne platform development team which manages the design, development and testing of airborne equipment and its integration with ground systems and leads FAA certification efforts; (iii) a product management and systems engineering team that manages all aspects of turning business requirements into technical specifications and is responsible for our program management process; (iv) an application development and business systems organization team that manages development of our internal business systems and the product extensions that sit on the AVANCE platform; and (v) a network engineering team that designs, implements and manages our network and data center infrastructure, security and core network functions. Production Operations . Our manufacturing objective is to produce superior quality products that conform to avionics specifications while providing the best value to our customers. Given our highly specialized technology and required production levels, we design, assemble and test our airborne line replaceable units in-house, while relying on third parties to manufacture specific components based on our design specifications to maximize production efficiencies. We retain the intellectual property associated with the airborne equipment. We also rely on third parties to manufacture our antennas and we generally share antenna design responsibilities and intellectual property with these vendors. Our manufacturing processes include internally designed test fixtures and software that we and our third-party manufacturers employ at all levels of manufacturing. Our manufacturing-related business processes – from sales forecasts to supply chain activities to shipping – are integrated and automated within our enterprise resource planning tools. Our manufacturing and repair facilities are FAA-certified. Competitive Strengths We maintain the leading global market position in connectivity for the business aviation market. We have designed our value proposition to align with our aviation partners’ priorities and we believe that our comprehensive product and service portfolio sets us apart from competitors by better meeting customer needs through: • Our Proprietary Networks and Exclusive Spectrum. We have developed, deployed and operated our own networks for more than 20 years, resulting in know-how and experience that we believe is unmatched by any other provider in our industry. We hold the exclusive license to the only nationwide broadband radiofrequency spectrum dedicated to air-to-ground use, as well as exclusive rights to the 6 same spectrum in Canada. This enables us to avoid the interference issues that can accompany use of shared, unlicensed spectrum. In addition to our ATG network, we have deployed Gogo Cloudport, which enables customers to wirelessly update Gogo Vision content while the plane is parked in the hanger. • Our Innovative Culture. We continuously innovate and have a strong track record of innovation in our networks. We pioneered and have led innovation in our industry for nearly 30 years, as evidenced by the three proprietary ATG networks technologies that we have deployed for the business aviation market. In addition, we hold approximately 350 U.S. and international patents, most of which relate to network technology. We are currently building our fourth ATG network – Gogo 5G. Gogo 5G will improve the passenger experience by providing lower latency and higher throughput than our current network using both our proprietary licensed spectrum and available unlicensed spectrum. • Our Extensible, Software-centric AVANCE Platform. Our networks and systems are designed to provide the best in-flight Internet experience and highest network and system availability across the broadest range of aircraft wherever they fly, and a growing number of our installed aircraft are on the AVANCE platform. The AVANCE platform is designed to be extensible. For example, we can add new products, features and options, we can increase connectivity speeds by augmenting spectrum and we can add proprietary or third-party ATG or satellite networks, all with minimal or no hardware or aircraft modifications. We expect this extensibility to facilitate standardization of hardware and FAA certifications across multiple products, spectrum frequencies and networks, and we expect that such standardization will in turn increase efficiency and improve quality in functions that include supply chain, production operations and customer support. • Our Vertical Integration. Unlike some of our competitors, our supply chain is vertically integrated. We believe that this vertical integration offers several advantages including: (i) increased agility in adjusting to changing market conditions; (ii) greater control over hardware design, manufacturing, cost and quality; (iii) greater control over hardware and services pricing; and (iv) increased ability to invest in and offer unique products and services at greater value to the customer. • Our Distribution Partners . Our distribution partners include every OEM of business aviation aircraft and an aftermarket network of approximately 120 dealers, many of whom we have worked with for decades. We have established trusted relationships with our distribution partners and a proven track record of generating revenues and profits for them, and they have trust and confidence in our ability to continue to do so. This facilitates our sales and our speed to market as our distribution partners are willing to invest in marketing and certification efforts for our equipment. Strategy Our strategy is to maintain and strengthen our leadership position by leveraging the competitive strengths described above to providing high-quality, cost-effective connectivity products and services. The principal elements of our strategy include the following: • Enhancing our networks by launching Gogo 5G and leveraging our licensed spectrum to provide the most reliable business aviation service in North America; • Increasing AVANCE units online by selling to new customers and upgrading current customers; • Offering AVANCE customers upgrades of existing products and services as well as new products and services in order to drive Average Revenue per Aircraft (“ARPA”); • Continuously improving our operations and leveraging the standardization inherent in the AVANCE platform to provide superior service and reduce costs; and • Optimizing our capital structure in order to strengthen our balance sheet and ensure our competitiveness. 7 Competition We compete against both equipment and telecommunications service providers to the business aviation market, including Honeywell Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Satcom Direct, Inmarsat and ViaSat. Also, SmartSky Networks has announced that it intends to enter the business aviation market later this year for aircraft operating in the continental United States. We believe that the principal points of competition in our market are technological capabilities, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Licenses and Regulation Federal Aviation Administration The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. The dealers and OEMs to which we sell our equipment are generally responsible for obtaining STCs for each aircraft type on which our equipment will be installed, and we support them in those efforts. Separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different owners and operators. After an STC is obtained, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a Parts Manufacturer Approval, or PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facility’s production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements. Certain of our FCC licenses are conditioned upon our ability to obtain from the FAA a “No Hazard Determination” for our cell sites, which indicates that a proposed structure will not, if built as specified, create a hazard to air navigation. When building or altering certain cell sites, we may first be required to obtain such a determination. Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified engineering and other professionals. In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures, and quality control systems continue to meet FAA requirements. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities or on aircraft. Foreign Aviation Regulation According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the airworthiness of U.S.-registered and FAA type-certificated aircraft on which FAA-certified Gogo equipment is installed is recognized by civil aviation authorities (“CAAs”) worldwide that are signatories to that Convention. As a result, Gogo does not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering Gogo equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA other than the United States, the installation of Gogo equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness 8 certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority. The FAA holds bilateral agreements with certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement (“BAA”) or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (“BASA”) with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart CAA. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircraft’s country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a Validation Supplemental Type Certificate. For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, Gogo must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification, Gogo will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each aircraft operator’s service in any country in which it registers aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on such aircraft. U.S. Department of Transportation The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) established an Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transport to negotiate and develop a proposed rule concerning accommodations for passengers with disabilities in three basic areas, including in-flight entertainment (“IFE”) and closed captioning of IFE. The Committee issued a resolution in late 2016 which included its recommendations to the DOT for a rule on IFE. However, since a final rule on IFE has not yet been issued, it is unclear how, if at all, it may impact Gogo. According to the Fall 2020 United Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions posted by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, the projected date of publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) by DOT on Accessible IFE is July 2021. Federal Communications Commission Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), the FCC licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless services. The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCC’s prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of Gogo by non-U.S. individuals or entities. Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. For example, we provide some of our voice and data services (not including Gogo Biz or AVANCE) by reselling the telecommunications services of two satellite operators. Because we provide these services on a common carrier basis, we are subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. In addition, we provide an interconnected voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) service. The FCC applies many, but not all, of the same regulatory requirements to interconnected VoIP service as it does to common carrier telecommunications services. We offer connectivity service in the United States to business aviation aircraft and, pursuant to the ATG Network Sharing Agreement, to certain commercial aircraft operated by Intelsat’s airline customers, through our own facilities, using our ATG License, a nationwide commercial air-ground radiotelephone license in the 800 MHz band. We obtained and paid for this spectrum through an auction conducted by the FCC. See “ATG License Terms and Conditions.” The FCC’s current rules classify broadband Internet access service as a lightly regulated, non-common carrier “information service,” and remove virtually all of the previously-imposed network neutrality restrictions on blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of broadband providers’ affiliates. We remain subject to certain modified transparency obligations that require 9 disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms. In its October 1, 2019 Mozilla Corp. v. FCC decision, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit partially upheld the FCC’s network neutrality rules and remanded several issues back to the FCC for further explanation, which the FCC resolved in October 2020. To the extent the FCC further restricts reasonable network management, or to the extent network neutrality proponents prevail on further administrative or appellate review, our business may be affected. Our Internet access service is also subject to the FCC’s data roaming rules, which require commercial mobile data service (“CMDS”) providers like Gogo to negotiate roaming arrangements with any requesting facilities-based, technologically compatible providers of CMDS. The rules do not give other providers the right to install equipment on Gogo-equipped aircraft and do not require the Gogo service to be provided on a discounted basis, although the arrangement must be “commercially reasonable.” The rules allow us to take reasonable measures to safeguard the quality of our service against network congestion that may result from roaming traffic. The FCC has committed to revisiting data roaming rules in the future. In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible to persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content offered through our Gogo Vision. In addition to the two ATG licenses, we hold microwave licenses that are used for backhaul in our terrestrial network and an authorization for the provision of voice and data services between the United States and foreign points. ATG License Terms and Conditions The FCC issued our ATG License on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term. We have satisfied our obligation under the license to provide “substantial service” to aircraft, and on January 25, 2017, we received confirmation from the FCC that the license has been renewed until October 31, 2026. Our 1 MHz ATG license obtained in 2013 from LiveTV Airfone, LLC was also originally issued on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term, although there is no “substantial service” obligation that attaches to this license. Our application to renew our license was subsequently granted for an additional 10-year term. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is not currently clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. Our two ATG licenses contain certain conditions that require us to comply with all applicable FCC and FAA rules as well as all bilateral agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico regarding the frequencies that are allocated for ATG services. These agreements apply to our use of the spectrum in areas adjacent to the United States’ northern and southern borders and in and out of Canadian and Mexican airspace. A bilateral ATG spectrum coordination agreement between the U.S. and Canada has been negotiated and approved and a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico is pending. In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary a subordinate license that allows us to use Canadian ATG spectrum of which SkySurf Communications Inc. is the primary licensee, and in 2019 the primary license was renewed for an eight-year term expiring June 29, 2027. In 2012, we entered into the License Agreement with SkySurf, which has an initial term of ten years commencing on August 14, 2012, and, provided that the primary spectrum license agreement issued by Industry Canada (now Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada or ISED) to SkySurf remains in effect at such dates, is renewable at our option for an additional 10-year term following the initial expiration and thereafter for a further five-year term. The term of the License Agreement, including the initial 10-year term and any renewals, is contingent on the effectiveness of the primary spectrum license. Any future coordination agreement with Mexico and/or a Mexican ATG licensee could affect our ability to provide our broadband Internet service in the border areas using our current cell sites at current operating power 10 levels and could affect our ability to establish or maintain ATG service in the border areas as aircraft fly into and out of Mexican airspace. Equipment Certification We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of our services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCC’s technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained. Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations We collect personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our service. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties. We use the information that we collect to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection and use of such information are intended to comply with our privacy policy, which is posted on our website; applicable law; and our contractual obligations to aviation partners and other third parties; as well as industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Notwithstanding that broadband Internet access is currently classified as a Title I information service, we must continue to comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Act prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” Although the FTC’s authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by communications common carriers has not been fully delineated, we believe that the FTC has jurisdiction over all of our services. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that among other things: (1) collect, use, share, or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the company’s actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information. We are also subject to state “mini-FTC Acts,” which prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state. Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect January 1, 2020 and provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA also imposes compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent, and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The California Office of the Attorney General has published final regulations to implement portions of the CCPA. In addition, in November 2020 California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which introduces significant amendments to the CCPA. The CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new regulations are expected to be introduced. Depending on such regulations, the measures we are required to take to comply with the CCPA may be significantly impacted. Congress and state legislatures have also been considering legislation relating to privacy and data breaches. Should any additional laws be enacted, they could affect our business. 11 To the extent we collect personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of the European Union (“EU”) took effect, which has imposed more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the EU that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. In addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries. For example, both Switzerland and the member states of the EU impose restrictions on transferring such data to countries, including the U.S., that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. Certain mechanisms apply under Swiss and EU member state laws that permit the cross-border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Additionally, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (the highest EU court) ruled the EU-US privacy shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCC” ) remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues regarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. . The regulation of data privacy and security in the EU and in other jurisdictions continues to evolve. EU member states also have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for certain data processing activities. Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection The FCC’s Truth in Billing rules require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our satellite-based services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. However, the FCC has recently initiated a proceeding to revise and potentially extend certain of its Truth in Billing rules, and any changes the FCC adopts may affect our compliance obligations. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers’ billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on ATG services. CALEA The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, which include Gogo, are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered service providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures. We have implemented such policies and procedures and, based upon our periodic self-assessments, we believe that our network is compliant with CALEA. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us. We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States and certain countries outside of the United States. As of March 4, 2021 we held U.S. patents expiring on dates ranging from January 2022 to March 2039, and foreign patents expiring on dates ranging from October 2021 to June 2037. We do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective. We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the United States and certain other countries include, among others, “Gogo,” “Gogo Biz” and “Gogo Vision,” although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks. 12 We license or purchase from third parties technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors. We also license our proprietary technology and software to third parties to enable them to integrate such technology and software into the products they provide to us. Many of our agreements with such third parties are renewable for indefinite periods of time unless either party chooses to terminate, although some of our agreements expire after fixed periods and require renegotiation prior to expiration in order to extend the term. Among the most material of our technology-related agreements are those for modems, base stations and antennas. Our agreements for modems, base stations and antennas do not renew automatically and thus require periodic renegotiation. Such agreements as well as certain licenses to commercially available software are material to our business. Under the terms of the Transaction, we retained ownership of the entire patent portfolio held by Gogo Inc. and its affiliates, including patents developed and obtained in connection with our former commercial aviation business. We have granted Intelsat a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive license to our patent portfolio for use in the commercial aviation and satellite mobility businesses (each as defined in the license agreement). Intelsat also has a limited, non-exclusive license right to use certain of our trademarks for up to two years as it transitions to its own brand. We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and vendors. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained. Human Capital We believe that our success is the product of an integrated approach to talent management that touches every part of our business. Rather than focusing on individual processes, we manage our employee ecosystem holistically by encouraging behaviors, conversations, relationships and activities that represent best practices for a high performing culture. We are committed to fostering a highly engaged workforce and in turn driving satisfaction among partners and customers through the following initiatives: • Compensation: Our compensation program is designed to attract, retain and reward the best performers. In addition to carefully calibrated salaries and bonuses, which are reviewed annually, our employees benefit from a generous benefit package, including employee stock purchase and 401(k) programs. Additionally, many of our employees are eligible for equity awards through our annual equity program as a part of their compensation. • Diversity: Gogo has formed a Diversity Council dedicated to furthering a culture of acceptance and respect for the attributes that differentiate people and/or groups. These attributes include race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and physical and developmental disabilities. It is our desire to create an environment where each individual’s uniqueness is respected and which allows for a sense of inclusion and belonging. • Training & Development: The continued development of our people is critical to our success. New hires participate in an onboarding and orientation program, which is intended to build knowledge and understanding of our business. We also invest in various professional development and leadership training initiatives and conduct quarterly forums relevant to our business that provide unique learning and networking opportunities across all business functions. • Recognition: Our employees’ success is celebrated. Our recognition programs include service awards, peer-to-peer recognition awards (called Gogo Props), spot bonuses for significant contributions above and beyond daily work efforts and special equity awards for high performers nominated by their leaders. We believe these programs promote a positive employee experience that champions performance while creating a sense of community. • Talent Review: We employ a comprehensive talent review program to assess the performance and capabilities of each individual. Annually we set company-wide priorities that serve as the basis upon which clear individual objectives are set across the entire workforce. Feedback is provided regularly 13 and our annual talent review process identifies and supports high performers in the form of additional development opportunities so that each employee has the opportunity to reach their full potential. By investing in our people and taking the opportunity to promote from within when appropriate, we believe we are best able to reinforce our core values and achieve our strategic objectives. • Feedback: We conduct annual employee engagement surveys to solicit feedback and help guide planning on all people related efforts and initiatives that not only support our team members but propel our business forward. These efforts are supported by our dedicated human resources team and led by our Executive Vice President, Chief People Experience Officer, who is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy and regularly updates our board of directors and senior management on the operation and status of our human capital activities. We have always made the health and safety of our employees a top priority, and even more so since the COVID pandemic started. We have encouraged those employees who can work remote to do so and have seen no negative impacts to productivity. We have also adopted various safety and cleaning protocols for those coming into our offices to ensure that we are doing everything we can to prevent the spread of the virus amongst our employees and the community. As of December 31, 2020, we had 349 employees, 347 of whom were full-time. No employee is a member of a labor union.

Risks Related to Our Business We may be unable to continue to generate revenue from the provision of our connectivity services, which could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability. Our business is dependent on our ability to continuously attract and retain users of our connectivity and other service offerings, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts or that customer retention levels will not materially decline. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Gogo service we provided on business aircraft (which excludes service provided on commercial aircraft under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement) generated approximately 78%, 72% and 68% of our revenue from continuing operations, respectively. A significant portion of such service revenue is generated through individual subscription agreements with our customers that cover a single or small number of aircraft, with the remainder generated through subscription agreements with certain fractional or charter operators covering larger fleets of aircraft. These agreements are generally no more than one-year in duration. As such, we have no assurance that any of such customers will renew their existing agreements with us upon expiration on comparable terms or at all, including as a result of a lack of demand or dissatisfaction with our services or the availability of superior or less expensive alternatives in the market. In addition, our subscription agreements are generally terminable at will by our customers and, if terminated, we may not be able to collect amounts we would have otherwise expected to receive during the full term of the agreement. To the extent that our subscribers terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us for any reason, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our subscription agreements do not generally contain minimum commitments for the usage of our connectivity and other services. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of reduced usage of our services by our customers or allow customers to suspend their accounts, which could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability. For example, we experienced a sharp decrease in flight activity, an increase in account suspensions and a decrease in new plan activities in the second quarter and, to a lesser extent, in the third quarter, of 2020 as a result of reduced travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are reliant on our key OEMs and dealers for equipment sales. Revenue from equipment sales accounted for approximately 21%, 28% and 32% of our revenue from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. More than 90% of our equipment revenue in each such fiscal year was generated from contracts with OEMs and after-market dealers. Almost all of our contracts with OEMs and dealers are terminable at will by either party on short notice. If one or more key OEMs or dealers terminates its relationship with us for any reason or our contract expires and is not renewed, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, pursuant to many of our contracts with our OEM distribution partners, we have agreed to deliver equipment and/or services, including equipment and services not yet in production, for a fixed price and, accordingly, take the risk of any cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Certain of our contracts with our OEMs also include provisions that, under specified circumstances, entitle them to the benefit of certain more favorable provisions in other equipment contracts, including with respect to pricing. These provisions, some of which have retroactive effect, may limit the benefits we realize from contracts containing such provisions. Our inability to identify and offer improved terms to a distribution partner or customer in accordance with such a 15 provision could negatively affect our relationship with that distribution partner or customer or give rise to a claim that we are in breach of such contract. Many of our distribution partners have also not committed to purchase any minimum quantity of our equipment. In certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon non-binding production schedules provided by OEMs, historical purchasing patterns and informal discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements. Cancellations, reductions or delays by OEMS and dealers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our distribution partners may be materially adversely impacted by economic downturns and market disruptions. In anticipation of changing economic conditions, OEMs in particular may be more conservative in their production, which may reduce our market opportunities. Further, unfavorable market conditions could cause one or more of OEMs or dealers to file for bankruptcy, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and could harm our results of operations. Our equipment and service are sold in competitive markets. Some of our current or potential future competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand pricing pressures and the effects of periodic economic downturns. Some of our current or future competitors may offer a broader product line or broader geographic coverage to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if our competitors: • develop equipment or service that is superior to our equipment and service; • develop equipment or service that is priced more competitively than our equipment and service; • develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing equipment and services; or • adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We believe that the principal points of competition in our business are technological capabilities, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, compliance with regulatory certification requirements, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer. In addition, competition may subject us to downward pricing pressures. Pricing at too high a level could adversely affect our ability to gain new customers and retain current customers, while increased competition could force us to lower our prices or lose market position and could adversely affect growth prospects and profitability. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to respond to established and new competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. A competitor is developing a North American air-to-ground 4G network using unlicensed spectrum and has announced that it will launch in-flight connectivity service in the continental United States in 2021. Other competitors could enter this business using the same or other air-to-ground spectrum. Another in-flight connectivity provider has launched service on commercial aircraft in Europe using a hybrid air-to-ground/satellite network. We do not currently offer satellite-based broadband service, and could face competition, particularly outside of North America, from owners of low earth orbit and other new non-geostationary satellite constellations should they decide to enter our market. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to combat it have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was reported in Wuhan, China, and the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) subsequently declared COVID-19 a “Public Health Emergency of International 16 Concern.” On March 13, 2020, the U.S. government declared a national emergency and on March 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of State issued a global Level 4 “do not travel” advisory advising U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19. The U.S. government has also implemented enhanced screenings, mandatory quarantine requirements and other travel restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions on travel from Asia, Europe, Mexico and Canada, and many foreign and U.S. state governments have instituted similar measures (including travel restrictions to and within the European Union) and declared states of emergency. At various points, most states and U.S. territories have issued instructions for their residents to stay home or “shelter in place” and to avoid any non-essential travel for varied durations of time and may lift, have lifted or will be lifting or easing these instructions at varied times, often with certain restrictions still in place. In addition, depending on the results of any easing or lifting of instructions and other restrictions, federal, state or local governments or authorities may determine to reinstate, enhance or enforce the same or other instructions or restrictions in the future. Governments, non-governmental organizations and entities in the private sector have also issued and may continue to issue non-binding advisories or recommendations regarding air travel or other social distancing measures, including limitations on the number of persons that should be present at public gatherings. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decline in international and domestic business aviation travel, which materially and adversely affected our business in 2020. Beginning in March 2020, our business saw a sharp decrease in flight activity, as well as an increase in requests for account suspensions and decreases in new plan activations. Though we continue to see strong signs of recovery from the lows we experienced in mid-April 2020, there can be no assurance that such recovery will continue at the current pace or at all. The impact of the pandemic has varied across different parts of our customer base – for example corporate flight departments, charter operators and commercial aircraft (under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement) – and we expect the pace of recovery to vary by type of customer also. The negative impact of COVID-19 on demand for commercial air travel could have an adverse effect on the revenue share payable to us by Intelsat under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement. We expect COVID-19 to continue to negatively impact our business and we are unable to predict how long or with what degree of severity that impact will continue. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our financial and operational performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the timetable for administering and efficacy of vaccines, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition to directly impacting demand for air travel, COVID-19 and related restrictions may have a material and adverse impact on other aspects of our business, including: • delays and difficulties in completing installations on certain aircraft; • delays or shortages in our supply chain; • our competitive position, including with respect to connectivity providers that do not operate exclusively in the aviation industry; and • limitations on our ability to market and grow our business and to promote technological innovation. At this time we are also not able to predict whether the COVID-19 pandemic will result in long-term changes to business practices and consumer behavior, with such changes including but not limited to a long-term reduction in travel as a result of increased usage of “virtual” and “teleconferencing” products. The full extent of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control. Our business requires substantial investment and/or financing and there can be no assurance that such investment and/or financing will result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Our business requires substantial investment and there can be no assurance that such investment will result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Since our initial public offering (“IPO”), we have obtained debt financing through our entry into our previous credit facility, issuances of convertible notes and issuances of senior 17 secured notes. Since the Transaction closed on December 1, 2020, we have not yet operated for a full fiscal quarter as a standalone business aviation provider and have not demonstrated an ability to generate positive cash flows. Our ability to do so will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenue and manage costs in our business. Our success may depend on our ability to raise additional financing on reasonable terms and on a timely basis. The amount and timing of our capital needs will depend in part on the extent of operating and capital expenditures required to broaden our service offerings and further develop and implement Gogo 5G and other components of our technology roadmap. In addition, we may actively consider from time to time other significant technological, strategic and operational initiatives. In order to execute on any of these initiatives, we may require additional financing. Furthermore, we expect that we will require additional financing to refinance, or repay at maturity, our indebtedness, including our 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) that mature on May 15, 2022, of which $237.8 million was outstanding at December 31, 2020. Conditions in the economy and the financial markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary additional capital or financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is also limited by the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, as amended, and the ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries would have been able to incur approximately $35 million of additional indebtedness, in the form of capital leases and borrowing under the ABL Credit Agreement. See “— Risks Related to Our Indebtedness—We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all .” If we cannot secure sufficient additional financing, we will be forced to forego strategic opportunities or delay, scale back or eliminate additional service deployment, operations and investments or employ unplanned internal cost savings measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unsuccessful at evaluating or pursuing strategic opportunities, which could adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition. Our Board and management continuously assess whether shareholder value would be increased by engaging in strategic and/or financial relationships, transactions or other opportunities, including those that are suggested to us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we will pursue any strategic or financial relationship, transaction or other opportunity, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Further, the process of evaluating and pursuing any such relationship, transaction or other opportunity will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks relating to assessing and undertaking strategic opportunities, it may disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, operating results and financial condition. We depend upon third parties, many of which are single-source providers, to manufacture equipment components, provide services for our network and install and maintain our equipment. We rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components and services that we use to provide our services. Many suppliers of critical components of our equipment are single-source providers. Components for which we rely on single-source suppliers include, among others, the antennas and modems for all systems and the equipment used at our ATG cell site base stations. If we are required for any reason (including expiration of the contract, termination by one party for material breach or other termination events) to find one or more alternative suppliers, we estimate that the replacement process could take up to two years depending upon the component, and we may not be able to contract with such alternative suppliers on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Finding and contracting with suppliers of some components may be delayed or made more difficult by current suppliers’ ownership of key intellectual property that requires alternative suppliers to either obtain rights to such intellectual property or develop new designs that do not infringe on such intellectual property. In addition, many of our components, such as the equipment used in our base stations, are highly integrated with other system components, which may further lengthen the time required for an alternative supplier to deliver a component that meets our system requirements. We also rely on third parties to provide the links between our data centers and our ground network. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or 18 on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The supply of third-party components and services could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers or a significant decline in their financial condition. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute our growth strategy. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business. Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries such as ours is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our ATG networks and related technology and develop and successfully deploy our technology roadmap and new wireless telecommunications products and technology. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel, including Oakleigh Thorne, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Gogo and its operations. As a result, if any of our key personnel were to leave Gogo, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key employees. In addition, much of our key technology and systems is custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, could disrupt our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Adverse economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business. Macro-economic challenges are capable of creating volatile and unpredictable environments for doing business. We cannot predict the nature, extent, timing or likelihood of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of any economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States or in the aviation industry. A weaker business environment could lead to a decrease in air travel, cause owners and operators of business aircraft to cut costs by reducing their purchases or use of private aircraft or their use of in-flight Internet access on such aircraft or reduce the number of airline passengers on commercial aircraft to which we supply ATG network access, thus adversely affecting the revenue share payable by Intelsat to us under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement. Should an economic slowdown occur in the U.S. or globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of operating as a standalone business after the sale of our CA business. We cannot be sure that the recent sale of the CA business will be successful in reducing our overall expenses and the expected efficiencies, benefits and cost savings of such a transaction and operating our business as a standalone business might be delayed or not realized. We expect to use the proceeds of the sale of our CA business to, among other things, reduce our net debt position and continue to invest in growth opportunities such as Gogo 5G. Such use of proceeds, however, may not ultimately have the desired result. Upon the closing of the Transaction, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the “TSA”) with Intelsat under which we and Intelsat agreed to, among other things, provide certain services to one another following the closing at negotiated prices for a period of up to one year. We are dependent upon Intelsat for certain resources essential to the day-to- day operation of our business. In addition, performance of our obligations to Intelsat under 19 the TSA may divert the attention of management and other employees from our day-to-day business and could disrupt our operations. If we are unable to manage the costs and the other risks associated with the TSA, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, we now operate as a standalone business aviation connectivity provider and are smaller and less diversified, with a narrower business focus, and we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions in the business aviation market. Additionally, the sale has reduced our ability to share certain costs across our businesses, such as the costs of operating as a public company, and may increase certain other operating costs, as we will no longer share suppliers and other business partners with the CA business. Upon the closing of the Transaction, we and Intelsat entered into the ATG Network Sharing Agreement, pursuant to which we provide certain inflight connectivity services on our ATG network to Intelsat, subject to certain revenue sharing obligations, and pursuant to which Intelsat has exclusive commercial aviation access to the ATG network in North America, subject to certain revenue guarantees. There can be no assurances that Intelsat will satisfy the revenue guarantees or maximize the revenues we could have generated if it did not have exclusive rights under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement. In addition, we and Intelsat have entered into a satellite network sharing agreement, pursuant to which Intelsat provides certain network services to us on their Ku-band and Ka-band satellite network. There can be no certainty that such agreement will provide us with sufficient network capacity or other benefits that we anticipate, or that it will remain in effect beyond the contemplated initial term. If we are unable to manage our cost structure and benefit from our ongoing relationship with Intelsat, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property We may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying Gogo 5G or other next generation technologies. We are currently developing a next generation ATG network using 5G technology and unlicensed spectrum. Gogo 5G will be capable of working with different spectrums and supporting different next generation technologies. There can be no assurance that we will launch Gogo 5G or any other next generation technology in sufficient time to meet growing user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience and to effectively compete in the business aviation market, due to, among other things, risks associated with: (i) our failure to design and develop a technology that provides the features and performance we require; (ii) integrating the solution with our existing ATG network; (iii) the availability of adequate spectrum; (iv) the failure of spectrum to perform as expected; (v) the failure of equipment and software to perform as expected; (vi) problems arising in the manufacturing process; (vii) our ability to negotiate contracts with suppliers on acceptable commercial and other terms; (viii) our reliance on single-source suppliers for the development and manufacturing of the core elements of the network and on other suppliers to provide certain components and services; and (ix) delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. If Gogo 5G or any other next generation technology fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines we establish, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our business is dependent on the availability of spectrum. In June 2006, we purchased at FCC auction an exclusive ten-year, 3 MHz license for ATG spectrum, and in April 2013, as part of our acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC, we acquired an additional 1MHz ATG spectrum license. In 2017, our applications to renew our licenses were granted for additional ten-year terms without further payment. Any breach of the terms of our FCC licenses or FCC regulations including foreign ownership restrictions, permitted uses of the spectrum and compliance with FAA regulations could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of our licenses or a refusal by the FCC to renew the licenses upon expiration. Further, in connection with an application to renew our licenses upon expiration, a competitor could file a petition opposing such renewal on anti-competitive or other grounds. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is currently not clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate 20 when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. While we do not currently use this license, changes in technology may enable its use in our network in the future. An ambiguous renewal requirement could impair our flexibility to use or otherwise realize the value of such spectrum beyond 2026. Our ability to offer in-flight broadband Internet access through our ATG service currently depends on our ability to maintain rights to use the 3 MHz ATG spectrum in the U.S. and our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to meet increasing performance demands and expand our service offerings in the United States will depend in part upon our ability to successfully roll-out our plans to employ unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band for concurrent use with the licensed 3 MHz spectrum and to launch Gogo 5G, and may likely require that we obtain additional licensed or unlicensed spectrum suitable for our use. Such spectrum may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain adequate spectrum could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional ATG spectrum, whether licensed or unlicensed, is or may become available in the United States or internationally in the future. While we have exclusive rights to the only broadband spectrum licensed by the FCC for ATG use and are currently the only provider of ATG service to business aircraft in the United States, the FCC may in the future decide to auction additional spectrum for ATG use that is not currently designated for that purpose, or a competitor could develop technology or a business plan that allows it to cost effectively use spectrum not specifically reserved for ATG, but on which ATG use is not prohibited, to provide broadband connectivity. The availability of additional spectrum in the marketplace that is available for ATG use may increase the possibility that we may face competition from one or more other ATG service providers in the future. For example, a competitor has announced that it is developing a North American 4G ATG network using the same unlicensed spectrum that we intend to use in our Gogo 5G network. Additionally, an in-flight connectivity provider has launched service on commercial aircraft in Europe using a hybrid air-to-ground/satellite network, and over time, we may face competition from that provider or ATG providers in other regions. We could be adversely affected if we suffer service interruptions or delays, technology failures, damage to our equipment or system disruptions or failures arising from, among other things, force majeure events, cyber-attacks or other malicious activities. Our brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depend upon the reliable performance of our ground network and in-flight systems. We have experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, and we may experience service interruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures, which may be due to factors beyond our control. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation, brand and customer retention could be harmed, and such failure could be material breaches of our customer contracts resulting in termination rights, penalties or claims for damages. Our operations and services depend upon the extent to which our equipment is protected against damage or interruption from fire, floods, earthquakes, tornados, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events. The capacity, reliability and security of our network infrastructure are important to the operation of our business, which may suffer in the event of system disruptions or failures, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities. Our networks may be vulnerable to these attacks and unauthorized access. 21 Assertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. We have faced, and may in the future face, claims that we or a supplier have violated patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Many companies, including our competitors, are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could potentially cover many aspects of our business. While we have reviewed the patent portfolios of certain competitors and other third parties, we have not exhaustively searched all patents relevant to our technologies and business and therefore it is possible that we may be unknowingly infringing the patents of others. Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious and whether or not they result in litigation, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our merchandizing or marketing and advertising activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Pursuant to our contracts with certain customers, we have agreed to indemnify such customers against such claims, and our indemnification obligations generally include defending or paying for the defense of the action and paying any judgments or other costs assessed against the customer in the event of an adverse outcome. In most cases, our contracts do not cap our indemnification obligations. In addition, certain of our suppliers do not indemnify us for third party infringement or misappropriation claims arising from our use of supplier technology, and we may be liable in the event of such claims. Our inability to meet our indemnification obligations and our customers terminating or failing to renew their contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We or our technology suppliers may be unable to continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to customers and passengers. The market for our services is characterized by evolving technology, changes in customer and passenger needs and performance expectations, and frequent new service and product introductions. Our success will depend, in part, on our and our suppliers’ ability to continue to enhance existing technology and services or develop new technology and services on a timely and cost-effective basis. If we or our suppliers fail to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, aviation partner and passenger requirements and/or regulatory requirements, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We expect to have to invest significant capital to keep pace with innovation and changing technology, and if the amount of such investment exceeds our plans or the amount of investment permitted under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the ABL Credit Agreement, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. As is common in industries like ours, changing technology may result in obsolescence as we implement new technologies and products and retire old technologies and products. As we encounter such obsolescence, we need to ensure that we have a sufficient supply of parts, products and equipment compatible with our existing technology, as well as access to maintenance, repair and other critical support services, until the transition is completed. Certain suppliers may determine to stop manufacturing and supplying end-of-life parts, products and equipment, or may stop providing related services, prior to completion of our transition. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient inventory from existing suppliers we would be required to engage new suppliers who have access to the intellectual property required to manufacture and support components that meet our specifications, and we may not be able to contract with such suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We have implemented policies and procedures intended to ensure that we timely anticipate technology and product transitions and have access to sufficient inventory and services, but if such policies prove ineffective and we are unable to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business to effect a transition, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, following our retirement of end-of-life technologies and products, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand and might have to write off unusable inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 22 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought and obtained patent protection for certain of our technologies in the United States and certain other countries. Many of the trademarks that we use (including marks we have applied to register) contain words or terms having a somewhat common usage, such as “Gogo” and “Gogo Vision” and, as a result, we may have difficulty registering them in certain jurisdictions. We do not own, for example, the domain www.gogo.com and we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we do business or may do business in the future. If other companies have registered or have been using in commerce similar trademarks for services similar to ours in foreign jurisdictions, we may have difficulty in registering, or enforcing an exclusive right to use, our marks in those foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be effective, that any patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not obtain intellectual property rights to similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Furthermore, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries in which our service is or may in the future be offered may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our ability to exploit our proprietary technology or our brand image may be harmed, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our use of open source software could limit our ability to commercialize our technology. Open source software is software made widely and freely available to the public in human-readable source code form, usually with liberal rights to modify and improve such software. Some open source licenses require as a condition of use that proprietary software that is combined with licensed open source software and distributed must be released to the public in source code form and under the terms of the open source license. Accordingly, depending on the manner in which such licenses were interpreted and applied, we could face restrictions on our ability to commercialize certain of our products and we could be required to: (i) release the source code of certain of our proprietary software to the public, including competitors, if the open source software was linked in a manner that would require such release of our proprietary software source code; (ii) seek licenses from third parties for replacement software; and/or (iii) re-engineer our software in order to continue offering our products. Such consequences may materially adversely affect our business. The failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation, result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages, and impair our ability to sell our service. Our products contain complex systems, components and software that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology or when new software is first introduced or new versions or enhancements are released. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. In addition, such events could result in significant expenses and diversion of development and other resources, a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our products and services, loss of existing customers, terminations of, failures to renew, penalties or damage claims under aviation partner contracts, harm to our reputation and brand image and increased insurance costs. If our in-flight system has a malfunction resulting from an error or defect or a problem with installation or maintenance and such malfunction causes physical damage to an aircraft or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could expose us to substantial personal injury claims, product liability claims or costly repair obligations. The aircraft operated by our customers may be very costly to repair and the damages in any product liability claims could be material. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we indemnify 23 some of our customers for losses due to third-party claims and in certain cases the causes of such losses may include failure of our products. Should we be required by the FAA or otherwise to cease providing the Gogo service, even on a temporary basis, as a result of a product malfunction or defect, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be materially adversely affected. Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons, we could lose our FCC license. Under the Communications Act and applicable FCC regulations, we are effectively restricted from having more than 25% of our capital stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons, including individuals and entities organized outside the United States or controlled by non-U.S. persons. We have established procedures to ascertain the nature and extent of our foreign ownership, and we believe that the indirect ownership of our equity by foreign persons or entities is below the 25% cap. However, as a publicly traded company we may not be able to determine with certainty the exact amount of our stock that is held by foreign persons or entities at any given time. A failure to comply with applicable restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. persons could result in an order to divest the offending ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or spectrum license revocation proceedings, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. Any breach of the terms of our ATG spectrum licenses or other licenses and authorizations obtained by us from time to time, or any violation of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of a license or the imposition of fines. From time to time, the FCC may monitor or audit compliance with the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules or with our licenses, including if a third party were to bring a claim of breach or noncompliance. In addition, the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, may be amended in the future in a manner that could be adverse to us. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Business—Licenses and Regulation—Federal Aviation Administration,” FAA approvals required to operate our business include STCs and Parts Manufacturing Authority (PMA). While our distribution partners are responsible for obtaining STCs, obtaining PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. Prior to installation of our equipment, any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining (including as a result of a government shutdown or funding shortages), or change in, needed FAA certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our installation commitments, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business. Following installation of our equipment, if we were to discover that our equipment or components of our equipment were not in compliance with specifications on which the STC authorizing installation was based, or if the FAA’s requirements changed, our non-compliance could result in our incurring material costs to inspect and in some circumstances modify or replace such equipment, and could in rare circumstances result in our system being turned off or installed aircraft being grounded. If we fail to comply with the FAA’s many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the FAA certifications, authorizations, or other approvals on which our manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alteration capabilities are based. In addition, from time to time, the FAA or comparable foreign agencies adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. The FAA could also change its policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies, which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, our compliance costs would likely increase. As a broadband Internet provider, we must comply with CALEA, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Currently, our CALEA solution is fully deployed in our network. However, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC or law enforcement agencies for any delays in complying or failure to comply with, CALEA, or similar obligations. Such enforcement actions could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties, all of which may materially adversely affect our 24 business and financial condition. Further, to the extent the FCC adopts additional capability requirements applicable to broadband Internet providers, its decision may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations. We are also subject to regulation by certain foreign laws and regulatory bodies, including Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, which issued our exclusive Canadian ATG subordinate spectrum license and regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us. Adverse decisions or regulations of these U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are unable to predict the impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business. Our possession and use of personal information present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation. In the ordinary course of our business, we or our third-party providers collect, process and store sensitive data, including personal information of aircraft passengers and our employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information (and other sensitive data such as our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers) is critical to our operations and business strategy. We depend on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party providers of telecommunications, cloud computing, customer support and other vendors. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, hardware or software defects or other disruptions. Further, our in-cabin network operates as an open, unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, and non-encrypted transmissions users send over this network may be vulnerable to access by other users on the same plane. Unauthorized use of our, or our third-party service providers’, networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including personal information of passengers using our service. Data security threats are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that any security measures we, or third parties, take will be effective in preventing these activities, given the constantly changing nature of the threats. Any such security incidents, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under our contracts with certain customers, which generally require us to indemnify the customer for passenger and other third-party claims arising from data security breaches. In addition, such incidents may disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to protect confidential user data or to provide users with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to investigations and regulatory penalties imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies, non-U.S. regulatory agencies or courts. For example, the FTC could assert jurisdiction to impose penalties if it found our privacy policies or security measures to be inadequate under existing federal law. We could also be subject to certain state laws, including so-called “mini-FTC Acts”, that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these rules or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also must comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our voice services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. Our failure to comply with these requirements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other countries in which we may operate or from which our services may be offered, including those in the European Union (“EU”), also have certain privacy and data security requirements that may apply to our business, either now or in the future. These countries’ laws may in some cases be more stringent than the requirements in the United States. For example, European Union member countries have specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions, including to the United States. In addition, some countries have stricter consumer notice and/or consent requirements relating to personal information collection, use or 25 sharing. Moreover, international privacy and data security regulations have become more complex. In May 2018, the GDPR took effect, which has imposed even more restrictive privacy-related requirements. Despite the substantial preparation and related expenditures that we undertook to be in compliance with the GDPR as of its effective date, there can be no assurance that we are or will continue to be in compliance. The regulation of data privacy and security in the EU and in other jurisdictions continues to evolve, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate effect of evolving regulation and implementation over time. EU member states also have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for certain data processing activities. Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) took effect January 1, 2020 and provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA also imposes compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent, and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The California Office of the Attorney General has published final regulations to implement portions of the CCPA. In addition, in November 2020 California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which introduces significant amendments to the CCPA. The CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new regulations are expected to be introduced. Depending on such regulations, the measures we are required to take to comply with the CCPA may be significantly impacted. Our failure to comply with GDPR, CCPA or other privacy or data security-related laws, rules or regulations imposed by U.S. federal or state governments or agencies or foreign governments or agencies could result in material penalties imposed by regulators or cause us to be in material breach under our airline agreements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be sure that a regulator would deem our security measures to be appropriate given the lack of prescriptive measures in certain data protection laws. Without more specific guidance, we cannot know whether our chosen security safeguards are adequate according to each applicable data protection law. Given the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be sure that our chosen security safeguards will protect against security threats to our business. Even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our or our partners’ information technology systems and the data contained in those systems. Moreover, interpretations or changes to new or existing data protection laws may impose on us responsibility for our employees and third parties that assist with aspects of our data processing. As a result, our employees’ or third parties’ intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase our vulnerability or expose us to security threats, such as phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for a successful phishing attack despite the quality and otherwise legal sufficiency of our security measures. Expenses or liabilities resulting from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Gogo Inc. and Intelsat, as well as certain of Intelsat’s airline partners, are currently defendants in a patent infringement lawsuit initially filed when we owned the CA business. In addition, Gogo Inc. and certain of our current and former executives are defendants in a securities class action lawsuit, and we are a nominal defendant, and members of our board of directors and certain current and former executives are defendants, in a related stockholder derivative lawsuit. We are required to indemnify the directors and current and former officers who are defendants in the class action and derivative lawsuits for their defense costs and any judgments resulting from such suits. In the future, we may be subject to additional securities class action or derivative litigation. From time to time, we may also be subject to other claims or litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including for example, claims related to employment matters. Our operations are characterized by the use of new technologies and services across multiple jurisdictions that implicate various statutes and a range of rules and regulations that may be subject to broad or creative interpretation. This may result in litigation, including class action lawsuits, the outcome of which may be difficult to assess or quantify due to the potential ambiguity inherent in these regulatory schemes and/or the nascence of our technologies and services. Plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate 26 amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products and services, or require us to pay significant monetary damages, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce our existing contracts and, even if successful, may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation by or against any customer or supplier could have the effect of negatively impacting our reputation and goodwill with existing and potential customers and suppliers. Regulations related to conflict minerals force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex. We are subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which requires us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals.” These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of certain of the materials used in the manufacture of components in our products and equipment. In addition, we have and will continue to incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We and our subsidiaries have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment. As of December 31, 2020, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $1.2 billion, including $975.0 million outstanding of our 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”), and $237.8 million outstanding of our 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”). Subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, as amended, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future, including up to $30.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability (and including letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities) under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”) pursuant to the credit agreement, dated as of August 26, 2019 (the “ABL Credit Agreement”), which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to: • a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; • our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited, and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness may be impaired in the future; • we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and which, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; • our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase; • our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future; • it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness; 27 • we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and • our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business units. We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all. We have from time to time evaluated, and we continue to evaluate, our potential capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, limitations on bandwidth capacity and performance and generally evolving technology in our industry. We may utilize one or more types of capital raising in order to fund any initiative in this regard, including the issuance of new equity securities and new debt securities, including debt securities convertible into our common stock. Since our IPO, we have obtained debt financing through our entry into our previous credit facility, issuances of convertible notes and issuances of senior secured notes. Since the Transaction closed on December 1, 2020, we have not completed a full fiscal quarter of operation as a standalone business aviation provider, and we have not demonstrated an ability to generate positive cash flows. Our ability to do so will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenue and manage costs in our business. In addition, our ability to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and the extent and timing of certain capital and other necessary expenditures are subject to numerous variables, such as costs related to execution of our current technology roadmap, including continuing development and deployment of Gogo 5G and other future technologies. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes, the ABL Credit Agreement and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited by the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining permitted indebtedness for Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and its subsidiaries was approximately $35 million in the form of capital leases and borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement. In the future, if our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and in the ABL Credit Agreement, our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. Neither the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes nor the ABL Credit Agreement prohibits Gogo Inc. from incurring additional indebtedness under any circumstances, but they do limit the amount of cash that our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to us to pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes or to pay interest on other indebtedness incurred by us, including indebtedness or preferred stock incurred to refinance, replace, renew or refund the 2022 Convertible Notes. The terms of any additional financing may further limit our financial and operating flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use the proceeds from any such financing to repay a portion of our outstanding debt. If we raise additional funds or seek to reduce our current levels of indebtedness through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and we may grant holders of such securities rights with respect to the governance and operations of our business. If we are unable to obtain 28 adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on desirable terms or at all, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could result in a default on existing indebtedness or future indebtedness. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements and instruments governing our debt. In addition, we do not currently have a revolving credit facility under which we can borrow to make payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance any indebtedness. In the absence of such sources of capital, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement restrict our ability to dispose of assets and how we use the proceeds from any such dispositions. In particular, the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes provides that if we complete certain sales or transfers of assets, we are required to apply the Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes) generated therefrom within 365 days to either permanently repay indebtedness or invest in property or non-current assets of a nature or type used in our or a similar or related business. If we do not so apply the Net Cash Proceeds from the Transaction by December 1, 2021, we will be required to offer to repurchase for cash an aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes equal to any Net Cash Proceeds not so applied as of such date, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the repurchase date. Our inability to utilize the Net Cash Proceeds from the Transaction or other dispositions for other purposes, such as to pay for general operating expenses, may negatively impact our business or financial condition. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, us to: • incur additional debt; • pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; • make certain investments; • create liens; • transfer or sell assets; • merge or consolidate with other companies; and • enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions 29 beyond our control. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such agreements and instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, may limit our ability in the future to satisfy currently outstanding obligations and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Additionally, any indebtedness under our ABL Credit Agreement will bear interest at variable rates that use the London inter-bank offered rate (“LIBOR”). On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop encouraging or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021 and, based on the foregoing, it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified before the end of 2021. In 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR publication, issued a consultation requesting feedback on its intention to continue publication of overnight and one-, three-, six- and 12-month USD LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023 (“IBA Announcement”) . There were concurrent announcements by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, U.S. bank regulators, the Federal Reserve Board and the Alternative Reference Rates Committee supporting the IBA Announcement and, among other things, encouraging banks to stop entering into new LIBOR-based contracts by the end of 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect the FCA Announcement, the IBA Announcement, any discontinuation, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR. Furthermore, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could increase the interest rates payable under our current and/or future indebtedness bearing interest at variable rates. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes, and any indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility, are secured by substantially all of our assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our secured indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes, and any indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility, are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, if an event of default were to occur under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement, the holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent amounts were outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility, the lenders party to the ABL Credit Agreement would have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries’ unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility. We may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to repay the 2022 Convertible Notes at maturity or to purchase the 2022 Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement may limit our ability to pay interest, or dividends, on indebtedness, or preferred stock, issued to refinance the 2022 Convertible Notes. Holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their 2022 Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. In addition, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the 2022 30 Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. The 2020 Convertible Notes became eligible for conversion at the election of holders on October 1, 2020 and are currently convertible until at least March 31, 2021. Upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 Convertible Notes being converted, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share). Moreover, we will be required to repay the 2022 Convertible Notes in cash on May 15, 2022, their maturity date, unless earlier converted or repurchased. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of 2022 Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or repay the 2022 Convertible Notes at maturity or upon 2022 Convertible Notes being converted. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement also does not allow our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us for the payment of the principal of the 2022 Convertible Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement limits the amount of cash our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes or to pay any interest on other indebtedness incurred by us, including indebtedness or preferred stock incurred to refinance, replace, renew or refund the 2022 Convertible Notes, which may limit our ability to issue debt or other securities in an amount necessary to refinance the outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes or at rates that such distributions could support. While we have reserved a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes to fund a portion of future interest payments on the 2022 Convertible Notes, the amount of such funds, together with funds up-streamed from subsidiaries and from other potential sources of liquidity (if any) may not be adequate to fund any future liquidity shortfall. See “— We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all .” Our failure to purchase 2022 Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes or to pay cash payable upon future conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes. A default under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the agreements and instruments governing our other indebtedness and the acceleration of amounts outstanding thereunder, including the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the 2022 Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. A default under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us, our subsidiaries or our indebtedness, if any, could cause our cost of capital to increase. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes have been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline. The trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our IPO, which occurred on June 21, 2013 and in which shares of common stock were sold at a price of $17.00 per share. From the IPO date through March 4, 2021, the price of our common stock has ranged from a closing low of $1.40 per share to a closing high of $34.34 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include: • aviation industry or general market conditions, including those related to the impact of COVID-19 on restrictions on and demand for air travel, as well as disruptions to supply chains and installations ; 31 • domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; • changes in technology or customer usage of Wi-Fi and Internet broadband services; • any inability to timely and efficiently roll out Gogo 5G or other components of our technology roadmap; • uncertainties and consequences arising from the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, including any financial, trade, tax and legal implications; • new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; • actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and any inability to generate positive cash flows on a consolidated basis in the future or to obtain additional financing; • changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance; • changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts; • action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales; • short-selling or other transactions involving derivatives of our securities; • speculation in the press or investment community; • investor perception of us and our industry; • changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies; • announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, contract amendments, acquisitions or strategic partnerships; • developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including increases or decreases in litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants; • failure to complete significant sales; • any future sales of our common stock or other securities; • renewal of our FCC license and our ability to obtain additional spectrum; and • additions or departures of key personnel. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many such companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adjustments by holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes of their hedging positions in our common stock and the forward stock purchase transactions, or any modifications of the forward stock purchase transactions, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Any buying or selling of shares of our common stock by holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes to establish or adjust hedged positions with respect to our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2022 Convertible Notes may also encourage short selling by market participants because any conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes could depress our common stock price. The price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the 2022 Convertible 32 Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation, and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity, which we expect to occur involving our common stock. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated privately negotiated prepaid forward stock purchase transaction (the “Amended and Restated Forward Transaction”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the “Forward Counterparty”), which replaced the prepaid forward stock purchase transaction entered into with the Forward Counterparty in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The Amended and Restated Forward Transaction is generally expected to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions, including swaps, between the Forward Counterparty and investors in the 2022 Convertible Notes relating to shares of our common stock by which investors in the 2022 Convertible Notes will establish short positions relating to shares of our common stock and otherwise hedge their investments in the 2022 Convertible Notes. The maturity date of such Amended and Restated Forward Transaction is on or around May 15, 2022, the maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. Such investors may enter into other transactions in connection with or in addition to such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of shares of our common stock. As a result of the existence of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction, such derivative transactions and any related market activity could cause more purchases or sales of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction than there otherwise would have been had we not entered into the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. Such purchases or sales, including sales made in connection with any refinancing or repurchase of our 2022 Convertible Notes, could potentially increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. In addition, in connection with any repurchase of our 2022 Convertible Notes, the Forward Counterparty may elect to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction early in accordance with its terms, which would result in a delivery of shares of our common stock to us earlier than the maturity date described above. In addition, we may request that the Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”), sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request for the Forward Counterparty to effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the Forward Counterparty on such terms as we may agree with the Forward Counterparty at the time. Additionally, the Forward Counterparty (or its affiliates) is likely to modify its hedge positions in respect of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock and/or by purchasing the shares of common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction (and are likely to do so during the final valuation period under the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction and on or around any election by the Forward Counterparty to settle all of a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction early). The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock. The Forward Counterparty is a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that it might default under the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Forward Counterparty is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the Forward Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the Forward Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the Forward Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. 33 Future stock issuances could cause substantial dilution and a decline in our stock price. We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangement, as consideration to third party service or equipment providers or otherwise. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The conversion of some or all of the 2022 Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion. The 2020 Convertible Notes are currently convertible at the election of holders and, to date, approximately $1.0 million of 2020 Convertible Notes have been converted into shares of common stock. We may issue additional shares of common stock upon any conversion or exchange of 2020 Convertible Notes pursuant to their terms or otherwise. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or exchange could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2022 Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Additional shares of common stock are also issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, including those subject to our option exchange program, which closed on June 12, 2020, that resulted in a reduction in the applicable exercise price of such options. We may also reserve additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or other similar forms of equity incentives. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Our President and CEO is a significant stockholder and could exert influence over our company, and if the ownership of our common stock continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. As of December 31, 2020, Oakleigh Thorne, our President and CEO and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, and the entities affiliated with Mr. Thorne (the “Thorne Entities”) beneficially owned approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Thorne is able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including approval of significant corporate transactions and the election of directors. Such ability to influence may reduce the market price of our common stock. As our President and CEO, Mr. Thorne has control over our day-to-day management and the implementation of major strategic initiatives and investments by our company, subject to authorization and oversight by our Board of Directors. As a member of our Board of Directors, Mr. Thorne owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Thorne is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interest, which may not always be in the interests of stockholders generally. Our corporate governance guidelines address potential conflicts between a director’s interests and our interests, and our code of business conduct, among other things, requires our employees and directors to avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with their job responsibilities or our interests and to disclose their outside activities, financial interests or relationships that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict to management or corporate counsel. These corporate governance guidelines and code of business ethics do not, by themselves, prohibit transactions with the Thorne Entities. Fulfilling our obligations associated with being a public company is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price. As a public company, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”), and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as NASDAQ rules, require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public 34 company obligations requires us to devote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. We are also required under Sarbanes-Oxley to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Our ability to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls will depend, in part, on our ability to transition responsibility for certain internal control processes from personnel whom we no longer employ following the Transaction to our employees. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls may materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ, or other regulatory authorities. The utilization of our tax losses could be substantially limited if we experienced an “ownership change” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $647 million in federal and $452 million in state NOLs. These deferred tax assets are currently fully reserved. The federal NOLs begin to expire in 2031. The state NOLs expire in various tax years and began to expire in 2016. Under Section 382 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as an increase of more than 50% of the value of the Company’s stock owned by certain “5-percent shareholders,” as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code, in its equity ownership over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. In September 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, and declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company outstanding on the record date of October 2, 2020, to the stockholders of record on that date. The Rights Agreement is designed to facilitate the Company’s ability to protect its NOLs and certain other tax attributes in order to be able to offset potential future income taxes for federal income tax purposes. The Rights Agreement may make it more difficult for the Company to undergo an ownership change by deterring a third party from acquiring 4.9% or more of the shares of our common stock. This may adversely affect the marketability of our common stock by discouraging any individual, firm, corporation, partnership or other person or group of affiliated or associated persons from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more shares of our common stock then outstanding. In addition, although the Rights Agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect utilization of our NOLs, there is no assurance that the Rights Agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our common stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement, our Board of Directors may determine that it is in the best interests of the Company to exempt certain transactions, that could result in an ownership change, from triggering the Rights Agreement. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOLs is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. 35 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, and certain provisions in our existing and any future credit facility could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include: • Authorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt; • Establishment of a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which our board will be divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting; • A requirement that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote; • A provision that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; • A limitation on who may call special meetings of stockholders; • A prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and • A requirement of supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. Additionally, our Board of Directors adopted the Rights Agreement, which is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code by deterring a third party from acquiring 4.9% or more of our shares of common stock then outstanding. The Rights Agreement, as well as the provisions described above, may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of the Rights Agreement or such provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. The Rights Agreement as well as the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management or Board of Directors. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. The terms of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the 2022 Convertible Notes, respectively, in the event of a change of control. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes to require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the 2022 Convertible Notes, respectively. In addition, under the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, a takeover of our company would allow the administrative agent and/or the lenders to terminate their commitments under the ABL Credit Agreement and declare any and all outstanding amounts to be due and payable. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership by non-U.S. citizens, including the power of our Board of Directors to redeem shares of our common stock from non-U.S. citizens. The Communications Act and FCC regulations impose restrictions on foreign ownership of FCC licensees, as described in the above risk factor, “— Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property—If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license .” Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions that 36 permit our Board of Directors to take certain actions in order to comply with FCC regulations regarding foreign ownership, including but not limited to, a right to redeem shares of common stock from non-U.S. citizens at prices at or below fair market value. Non-U.S. citizens should consider carefully the redemption provisions in our certificate of incorporation prior to investing in our common stock. These restrictions may also decrease the liquidity and value of our stock by reducing the pool of potential investors in our company and making the acquisition of control of us by third parties more difficult. In addition, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to attract equity financing or consummate an acquisition of a foreign entity using shares of our capital stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Currently, we lease approximately 120,000 square feet for our business in Broomfield, Colorado, under a lease agreement that expires in 2029. In addition, we license approximately 8,200 square feet in Chicago, Illinois for those of our employees who live in the metropolitan Chicago area, pursuant to a license agreement with Intelsat that expires on November 30, 2021 and is renewable by agreement of the parties. Before renewing the license agreement, we plan to explore opportunities to lease other space in the Chicago area. We believe that our existing Broomfield facilities, together with our current Chicago space or such other space in the Chicago area as we determine to lease, will be adequate for the foreseeable future. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Linksmart Litigation - On April 20, 2018, Linksmart Wireless Technology, LLC filed suit against Gogo Inc., Gogo LLC, our former subsidiary and the entity that operated our CA business (“Gogo LLC”), and eight CA airline partners in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that CA’s redirection server and login portal infringe a patent owned by the plaintiff. The suits seek an unspecified amount of damages. Intelsat is required under its contracts with these airlines, which it assumed in the Transaction, to indemnify them for defense costs and any liabilities resulting from the suit. The Court has stayed the suits against the airline customers pending resolution of the suit against Gogo. Linksmart has also filed suit against other defendants asserting the same patent. Following the filing by one of those defendants of a petition to commence an inter partes review against the asserted patent in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Court stayed the litigation against such other defendant, Gogo Inc. and Gogo LLC, but such stay was lifted in July 2019 when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the petitioner had not met the standard of proof required to commence the inter partes review. Since the stay was lifted, discovery has been completed and motion practice continues. No date has been set for trial. We believe that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. The outcome of this litigation is inherently uncertain. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Securities Litigation - On June 27, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division styled Pierrelouis v. Gogo Inc., naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, its current Chief Financial Officer and its then-current President, Commercial Aviation as defendants purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our securities from February 27, 2017 through May 4, 2018. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, alleging misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to the reliability of and installation and remediation costs associated with CA’s 2Ku antenna. The plaintiffs seek to recover from us and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages. In December 2018 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and in February 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss such amended complaint. In October 2019 the judge granted the motion to dismiss on two independent grounds, finding that plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that defendants made materially false or misleading statements and that plaintiffs failed to plead with particularity that defendants acted with scienter. The amended complaint was dismissed without prejudice, and in December 2019, defendants filed a second amended complaint. In July 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting leave to file a proposed third 37 amendment complaint, which was granted by the Court. Plaintiffs proceeded to file the third amended complaint in July 2020 and we filed a motion to dismiss in September 2020. That motion has been fully briefed and we await the Court’s ruling. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. In accordance with Delaware law, we will indemnify the individual named defendants for their defense costs and any damages they incur in connection with the suit. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy with respect to this suit. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Derivative Litigation - On September 25, 2018 and September 26, 2018, two purported stockholders of the Company filed substantively identical derivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, styled Nanduri v. Gogo Inc. and Hutsenpiller v. Gogo Inc., respectively. Both lawsuits were purportedly brought derivatively on behalf of us and name us as a nominal defendant and name as defendants each member of the Company’s Board of Directors, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and allege misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to the 2Ku antenna’s reliability and installation and remediation costs, as well as allegedly excessive bonuses, stock options, and other compensation paid to current Officers and Directors and excessive severance paid to former Officers. The two lawsuits were consolidated and are stayed until a final disposition of the motion to dismiss in the class action suit. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously if the litigation resumes. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on our behalf, an unspecified amount of damages from the individual defendants. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy with respect to these suits. No amounts have been accrued for any potential costs under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential costs. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material adverse impact on our company due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted, which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as damages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 38 Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information for Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “GOGO” since June 21, 2013. Holders of Record As of March 4, 2021, there were 45 stockholders of record of our common stock, and the closing price of our common stock was $11.39 per share as reported on the NASDAQ.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On December 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our commercial aviation (“CA”) business to a subsidiary of Intelsat Jackson Holdings S.A. (“Intelsat”) for a purchase price of $400 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the “Transaction”). As a result, all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements and other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as discontinued operations. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Our fiscal year ends December 31 and, unless otherwise noted, references to years or fiscal are for fiscal years ended December 31. See “— Results of Operations.” Company Overview Gogo is the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every passenger on every flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated air-to-ground (“ATG”) networks, engineer, install and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software, and deliver customizable connectivity and wireless entertainment services and global support capabilities to our aviation partners. Our services include satellite-based voice and data services made available through strategic partnerships with satellite providers. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and business results for our operations, and makes resource and operating decisions, on a consolidated basis. As such, we do not present segment information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant decline in international and domestic business aviation travel, which materially and adversely affected our business in 2020. Beginning in March 2020, our business saw a sharp decrease in flight activity, as well as an increase in requests for account suspensions and decreases in new plan activations. Though we continue to see strong signs of recovery from the lows we experienced in mid-April 2020, we expect COVID-19 to continue to negatively impact our business and we are unable to predict how long or with what degree of severity that impact will continue. The impact of the pandemic has varied across different parts of our customer base – for example corporate flight departments, charter operators and commercial aircraft (under the ATG Network Sharing Agreement) – and we expect the pace of recovery to vary by customer type also. Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations We believe that our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that affect the business aviation industry, including trends affecting the travel industry and trends affecting the customer bases that we target, as well as factors that affect wireless Internet service providers and general macroeconomic factors. Key factors that may affect our future performance include: • costs associated with the implementation of, and our ability to implement on a timely basis our technology roadmap, including upgrades to and installation of the ATG technologies we currently offer, Gogo 5G, and any other next generation or other new technology; 41 • our ability to manage issues and related costs that may arise in connection with the implementation of our technology roadmap, including technological issues and related remediation efforts and failures or delays on the part of antenna and other equipment developers and providers, some of which are single source; • our ability to license additional spectrum and make other improvements to our network and operations as technology and user expectations change; • the number of aircraft in service in our markets, including consolidations or changes in fleet size by one or more of our large-fleet customers; • the economic environment and other trends that affect both business and leisure aviation travel, including the impact of COVID-19 on restrictions on and demand for air travel, as well as disruptions to supply chains and installations; • the extent of our customers’ adoption of our products and services, which is affected by, among other things, willingness to pay for the services that we provide, the quality and reliability of our products and services, changes in technology and competition from current competitors and new market entrants; • our ability to engage suppliers of equipment components and network services on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms; • changes in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting telecommunications services, including those affecting our ability to maintain our licenses for ATG spectrum in the United States, obtain sufficient rights to use additional ATG spectrum and/or other sources of broadband connectivity to deliver our services, expand our service offerings and manage our network; and • changes in laws, regulations and policies affecting our business or the business of our customers and suppliers, including changes that impact the design of our equipment and our ability to obtain required certifications for our equipment. Key Business Metrics Our management regularly reviews financial and operating metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate the performance of our business and our success in executing our business plan, make decisions regarding resource allocation and corporate strategies, and evaluate forward-looking projections.

Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations As a result of the Transaction, all periods presented in this Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as a discontinued operation. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. The results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented. Refer to Note 2, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements for further information. The following briefly describes certain key components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Revenue: We generate two types of revenue: service revenue and equipment revenue. Service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services. Service revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Beginning December 2020, service revenue includes revenue earned from the ATG Network Sharing Agreement with Intelsat. Equipment revenue primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of ATG and satellite connectivity equipment and entertainment equipment. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped to OEMs and dealers. Cost of Revenue: Cost of service revenue consists of ATG network costs, satellite provider service costs, transaction costs and costs related to network operations. Before closing the Transaction, we operated two divisions – business aviation (“BA”) and commercial aviation (“CA”). In January 2019, BA assumed responsibility for operating and maintaining our ATG network and was allocated the majority of the ATG network costs incurred in fiscal year 2019. In January 2020, we adopted a new allocation methodology for the ATG network costs utilizing pricing and usage for each of CA and BA. This allocation methodology has been applied retrospectively to prior periods presented as the CA business is reported in 43 discontinued operations. S ince the completion of the Transaction, we ceased allocating ATG network costs to the divested CA business . Cost of equipment revenue primarily consists of the costs of purchasing component parts used in the manufacture of our equipment and the production, installation, technical support and quality assurance costs associated with the equipment sales. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses include the costs incurred to design and develop our technologies and products and to obtain and maintain FAA and other regulatory certifications. This includes the design, development and integration of our ATG ground networks and airborne line replaceable units, the design and development of products and enhancements thereto, and program management activities. Engineering, design and development expenses also include costs associated with enhancements to existing products. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with activities related to customer sales (including sales commissions), digital marketing and lead generation, advertising and promotions, product management, trade shows and customer service support for end users. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses include personnel and related operating costs of the business support functions, including finance and accounting, legal, human resources, administrative, information technology, facilities and executive groups. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation expense includes expense associated with the depreciation of our network equipment, office equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements, which is recorded over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense includes the amortization of our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to ten years depending on the assets being amortized. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related exposures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In some instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and that they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies to which many of these critical estimates relate, see Note 3, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements. 44 We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, indefinite-lived intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Note that these critical accounting policies and estimates relate solely to our continuing operations. The accounting policies related to our discontinued operations are discussed in Note 2, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition : We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: • Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; • Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; • Determination of the transaction price; • Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and • Recognition of revenue as we satisfy the performance obligations. See Note 5, “Revenue Recognition,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. We sell airborne telecommunications equipment to OEMs and dealers, who purchase the equipment based on their planned production or aftermarket sales, or in some cases based on specific orders made by aircraft owners and operators. These distribution partners resell the equipment and install the equipment for the aircraft owners and operators. Revenue for equipment sales to distribution partners is recognized upon shipment of equipment after an executed contract, purchase order or other documented agreement has been received and control of the equipment has transferred. We also provide connectivity, entertainment and voice services to the owners and operators of business aircraft for a monthly subscription fee or a usage-based fee. These services are typically contracted for a one-year period and automatically renew unless cancelled at the end of the service period. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as services are provided. In all cases, we evaluate whether a contract exists as it relates to collectability of the contract. Once a contract is deemed to exist, we evaluate the transaction price and deliverables under the contract. A limited number of contracts contain multiple equipment and service deliverables. For these contracts, we account for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which is based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets: We account for our indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350-40, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350-40”). Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of our FCC spectrum licenses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of impairment. Our qualitative analysis includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environment, industry and market conditions or events, such as COVID-19, financial performance versus budget and any other events or circumstances specific to the FCC licenses. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the 45 FCC spectrum licenses is greater than the carrying value, no further testing is required. Otherwise, we apply the quantitative impairment test method. We determined that the income approach, utilizing the Greenfield method, is the most appropriate way to value our indefinite-lived assets. For the Greenfield method we estimate the value of our FCC spectrum licenses by calculating the present value of the cash flows of a hypothetical new market participant whose only assets are such licenses to determine the fair value of the FCC licenses. It includes all necessary costs and expenses to build the company’s infrastructure during the start-up period, projected revenue, and cash flows once the infrastructure is completed. Since there is limited corroborating data available in the marketplace that would demonstrate a market participant’s experience in establishing an “air-to-ground” business, we utilize our historic results and future projections as the underlying basis for the application of the Greenfield method. We follow the traditional discounted cash flow method, calculating the present value of a new market participant’s estimated debt free cash flows, based on our historical weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the cost of capital for a new market participant. Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19, because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future projected cash flows and estimated growth rates and discount rates, as well as new market participant assumptions. Estimates of future projected cash flows used in connection with the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with the plans and estimates that we used to manage the business, including estimates of the impact of COVID-19, although there was inherent uncertainty in these estimates. Our annual assessment as of October 1, 2020 indicated no impairment. We are continuously monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. If the negative impact of the pandemic exceeds management’s estimates, we could incur material impairment charges in future periods. See Note 8, “Intangible Assets,” to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Stock-Based Compensation Expense: We account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 708, Compensation-Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). We account for stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award for awards deemed to be equity awards. For awards deemed to be liability awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at each reporting date. We recognize this cost as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of stock options. Critical inputs into the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include: the annualized volatility of our common stock; the expected term of the option in years; the grant date fair value of our common stock; the option exercise price; the risk-free interest rate; and the annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock, which are estimated as follows: • Volatility. Beginning in 2020, we calculated volatility based exclusively on our own common stock. In prior years, we had not been a public company long enough to calculate volatility based exclusively on our own common stock, and thus calculated the expected volatility as of each grant date based on a weighting of our own common stock and reported data for a peer group of publicly traded companies for which historical information was available. • Expected Term. The expected term of the stock options is determined based upon the simplified approach, allowed under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, which assumes that the stock options will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. As we obtain data associated with future exercises, the expected term of future grants will be adjusted accordingly. • Fair Value of Our Common Stock. The fair value of our common stock underlying the stock options and other stock-based awards was valued by reference to the publicly traded closing price of our common stock on the grant date. 46 • Option Exercise Price. T he option exercise price was determined based on the publicly traded closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. • Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. • Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense for future awards may differ materially from the expense recognized for awards previously granted. The inputs that create the most sensitivity in our option valuation are the volatility and expected term. See Note 14 , “Stock-Based Compensation ,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our consolidated statements of operations. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. 47 Consolidated Statements of Operations Data (in thousands) For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Revenue: Service revenue $ 211,987 $ 221,922 $ 196,377 Equipment revenue 57,731 87,063 93,776 Total revenue 269,718 308,985 290,153 Operating expenses: Cost of service revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 45,073 42,142 37,139 Cost of equipment revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 39,299 51,744 55,416 Engineering, design and development 25,227 26,013 18,519 Sales and marketing 15,135 21,236 24,396 General and administrative 54,467 54,628 57,903 Depreciation and amortization 14,166 16,690 14,363 Total operating expenses 193,367 212,453 207,736 Operating income 76,351 96,532 82,417 Other (income) expense: Interest income (722 ) (4,000 ) (4,122 ) Interest expense 125,787 130,473 122,620 Loss on extinguishment of debt - 57,962 19,653 Other (income) expense (9 ) 31 80 Total other expense 125,056 184,466 138,231 Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (48,705 ) (87,934 ) (55,814 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (146 ) 563 (3,354 ) Net loss from continuing operations (48,559 ) (88,497 ) (52,460 ) Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (201,477 ) (57,507 ) (109,571 ) Net loss $ (250,036 ) $ (146,004 ) $ (162,031 ) Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 Revenue: Revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years Ended % Change December 31, 2020 over 2020 2019 2019 Service revenue $ 211,987 $ 221,922 (4.5 )% Equipment revenue 57,731 87,063 (33.7 )% Total revenue $ 269,718 $ 308,985 (12.7 )% Revenue decreased to $269.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $309.0 million for the prior year, due to decreases in service and equipment revenue. Service revenue decreased to $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $221.9 million for the prior year, primarily due to ATG deactivations and suspensions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average monthly service revenue per ATG unit online decreased to $2,951 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $3,113 for the prior year. Equipment revenue decreased to $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $87.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the number of ATG and satellite units sold related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 667 ATG units were sold during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with 909 units for the prior year. 48 We expect service and equipment revenue to increase in the future as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic dissipates and additional ATG aircraft come online. Cost of Revenue: Cost of service revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years Ended % Change December 31, 2020 over 2020 2019 2019 Cost of service revenue $ 45,073 $ 42,142 7.0 % Cost of equipment revenue $ 39,299 $ 51,744 (24.1 )% Cost of service revenue increased to $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $42.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in allocated ATG network costs. Following the completion of the Transaction, ATG network costs are no longer shared with the divested CA business. We expect cost of service revenue to increase over time, primarily due to service revenue growth and increasing ATG network costs associated with Gogo 5G. Cost of equipment revenue decreased to $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $51.7 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in equipment revenue. We expect that our cost of equipment revenue will vary with changes in equipment revenue and unit sold. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses decreased to $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $26.0 million for the prior year, due to a decrease in personnel, travel costs and miscellaneous other costs resulting from cost controls implemented by management, primarily in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We expect engineering, design and development expenses to remain flat or increase slightly as a percentage of service revenue in the near term, driven by Gogo 5G development costs, and decrease as a percentage of service revenue over the long term as the level of investment decreases and revenue increases. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $21.2 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreased personnel and advertising expenses and cost controls implemented by management in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We expect sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively flat as a percentage of service revenue. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses decreased slightly to $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $54.6 million for the prior year. We expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of service revenue over time as we identify efficiencies and drive down costs and as the business grows given the fixed cost nature of this category. 49 Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $16.7 million for the prior year, primarily due to certain ATG network assets becoming fully depreciated. We expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase in the future as we launch our Gogo 5G network. Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years % Change Ended December 31, 2020 over 2020 2019 2019 Interest income $ (722 ) $ (4,000 ) (82.0 %) Interest expense 125,787 130,473 (3.6 %) Loss on extinguishment of debt — 57,962 nm Other (income) expense (9 ) 31 nm Total $ 125,056 $ 184,466 (32.2 %) Total other expense decreased to $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with $184.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt that occurred in 2019. Absent a debt refinancing in 2021, we expect our interest expense to increase due to the higher average debt outstanding resulting from the issuance of the 2020 Additional Notes in November 2020. See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 0.3%, as compared with (0.6%) for the prior year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was not significant primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We expect our income tax provision to increase in future periods to the extent we become profitable. Discontinued Operations: Loss from discontinued operations increased to $201.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared with a loss of $57.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in revenue and $47.4 million of charges related to the impairment of long-lived assets, partially offset by the $38.0 million gain on sale of discontinued operations. Revenue decreased 55.7% as compared with the prior year, primarily as a result of the negative impact of COVID-19 on commercial air travel. Additionally, results for the year ended December 31, 2020 included charges of $47.4 million and $10.7 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets and provisions for expected credit losses, respectively, while no such charges were incurred in the prior year. These changes were partially offset by declines in cost of service revenue, cost of equipment revenue, engineering, design and development expenses and general and administrative expenses, primarily due to the cost control measures implemented in 2020 in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the CA business. Upon the closing of the Transaction on December 1, 2020, we received initial gross proceeds of $386.3 million, which reflects the $400.0 million purchase price, adjusted for cash, debt, transaction expenses and working 50 capital. The final purchase price remains subject to change due to customary post-closing purchase price adjustment procedures set forth in the purchase and sale agreement between Gogo and Intelsat, that are not yet complete. I n February 2021, Intelsat delivered a draft closing statement that would reduce the working capital portion of the purchase price computation by $9.4 million, which would result in Gogo returning to Intelsat $9.4 million of the initial gross proceeds. Gogo is reviewing Intelsat’s draft closing statement in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement. As this post-closing purchase price adjustment is not yet finalized and therefore represents a contingent gain, $9.4 million has been recorded as a deferred gain on sale included within Accrued liabilities. As a result, we have recognized within Other (income) expense a pretax gain on sale of $ 38.0 million, computed as the $386.3 million of initial gross proceeds less (i) the potential $9.4 million post-closing purchase price adjustment, (ii) the carrying value of the assets and liabilities transferred in the Transaction and (iii) Transaction -related costs . See Note 2, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 Revenue: Revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years Ended % Change December 31, 2019 over 2019 2018 2018 Service revenue $ 221,922 $ 196,377 13.0 % Equipment revenue 87,063 93,776 (7.2 )% Total revenue $ 308,985 $ 290,153 6.5 % Revenue increased to $309.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $290.2 million for the prior year, due to an increase in service revenue offset in part by a decrease in equipment revenue. Service revenue increased to $221.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $196.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to more customers subscribing to our ATG service. The number of ATG aircraft online increased 8.5% to 5,669 as of December 31, 2019, as compared with 5,224 as of December 31, 2018. Average monthly service revenue per ATG unit online increased to $3,113 during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $3,027 for the prior year. Equipment revenue decreased to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $93.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in sales of ATG equipment. Cost of Revenue: Cost of service revenue and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years Ended % Change December 31, 2019 over 2019 2018 2018 Cost of service revenue $ 42,142 $ 37,139 13.5 % Cost of equipment revenue $ 51,744 $ 55,416 (6.6 )% 51 Cost of service revenue increased to $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $37.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to a Federal Universal Service fund charge . Cost of equipment revenue decreased to $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $55.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in equipment revenue. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses increased to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $18.5 million for the prior year, due to the incurrence of 5G development costs in 2019. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $24.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses decreased to $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $57.9 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreases in legal and personnel-related expenses. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $14.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in amortization of capitalized software. Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : For the Years % Change Ended December 31, 2019 over 2019 2018 2018 Interest income $ (4,000 ) $ (4,122 ) (3.0 %) Interest expense 130,473 122,620 6.4 % Loss on extinguishment of debt 57,962 19,653 194.9 % Other (income) expense 31 80 (61.3 %) Total $ 184,466 $ 138,231 33.4 % Total other expense was $184.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $138.2 million for the prior year, due to a larger loss on extinguishment of debt and increased interest expense due to higher average debt levels outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the prior year. See Note 9, “Long Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the loss on extinguishment of debt. See Note 10, “Interest Costs,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our interest expense. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was (0.6%), as compared with 6.0% for the prior year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was not significant primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. 52 Discontinued Operations: Loss from discontinued operations decreased to $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with a loss of $109.6 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in revenue of $76.9 million, more than offset by a $126.4 million reduction in operating expenses. Revenue decreased 12.7% as compared with the prior year, driven by a decline in equipment revenue due to fewer installations of CA equipment on airline partners’ aircraft and the transition of one airline to a different business model in January 2018 that increased equipment revenue by $45.4 million for the year-ended December 31, 2018. The reduction in operating expenses was driven by a reduction in cost of equipment revenue related to the reduced equipment revenue discussed above, as well as decreased engineering, design and development expenses related to programs and personnel, and decreased sales and marketing expenses related to personnel. See Note 2, “Discontinued Operations,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Non-GAAP Measures In our discussion below, we discuss Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, which is a non-GAAP financial measurement. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes, including managing our business and measuring our performance against internally projected results of operations. This supplemental performance measure also provides another basis for comparing period-to-period results by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP; when analyzing our performance with Adjusted EBITDA, investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure, and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments, and (ii) use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative to, net loss attributable to common stock as a measure of operating results. Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA represents net loss attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) stock-based compensation expense included in the results of continuing operations, (ii) the results of discontinued operations, including stock-based compensation expense and the gain on the sale of CA, and (iii) loss on extinguishment of debt. Our management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that management believes have less bearing on our operating performance, thereby highlighting trends in our core business which may not otherwise be apparent. It also provides an assessment of controllable expenses, which are indicators management uses to determine whether current spending decisions need to be adjusted in order to meet financial goals and achieve optimal financial performance. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense from Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate given the significant variation in expense that can result from using the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of such compensation. The fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model and varies based on fluctuations in the assumptions used in this model, including inputs that are not necessarily directly related to the performance of our business, such as the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the options. Therefore, we believe that the exclusion of this cost provides a clearer view of the operating performance of our business. Further, stock option grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. While we believe that investors should have information about any dilutive effect of outstanding options and the cost of that compensation, we also believe that stockholders should have the ability to consider our performance using a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these costs and that management uses to evaluate our business. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the results of our discontinued operations because they are not part of our ongoing operations. 53 We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the loss on extinguishment of debt from Adjusted EBITDA because of the non-recurring nature of this activity. We also present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides investors, securities analysts and other users of our financial statements with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management. Gogo Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (in thousands, except per share amounts) (unaudited) For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss attributable to common stock (GAAP) $ (250,036 ) $ (146,004 ) $ (162,031 ) Interest expense 125,787 130,473 122,620 Interest income (722 ) (4,000 ) (4,122 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (146 ) 563 (3,354 ) Depreciation and amortization 14,166 16,690 14,363 EBITDA (110,951 ) (2,278 ) (32,524 ) Stock-based compensation expense 7,808 8,654 8,536 Loss from discontinued operations 201,477 57,507 109,571 Loss on extinguishment of debt - 57,962 19,653 Adjusted EBITDA $ 98,334 $ 121,845 $ 105,236 Material limitations of Non-GAAP measures Although EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measurements frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA each have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include: • EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest income or expense; • EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for our income taxes; • EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect depreciation and amortization, which are significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of capital expenditures needed to maintain our business; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash components of employee compensation; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the results of discontinued operations; • Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the loss on extinguishment of debt, which was significant in certain periods; and • since other companies in our or related industries may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, their usefulness as comparative measures may be limited. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically financed our growth and cash needs primarily through the issuance of common stock, non-convertible debt, senior convertible preferred stock, convertible debt, term facilities and cash from operating 54 activities. We continually evaluate our ongoing capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, capacity requirements , evolving user expectations regarding the in-flight connectivity experience , evolving technologies in our industry and related strategic, operational and technological opportunities. We actively consider opportunities to raise additional capital in the public and private markets utilizing one or more of the types of capital raising transactions through which we have historically financed our growth and cash needs, as well as other means of capital raising not previously used by us. We are also currently considering undertaking a comprehensive refinancing of our existing indebtedness in the near-term in order to better align our capital structure with our business, following consummation of the Transaction, and reduce our annual interest expense. Such financing activity may take the form of one or more forms of indebtedness, including, but not limited to, secured or unsecured bonds, term loans and revolving credit facilities. Our ability to execute on any financing transaction will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See the disclosure below under the heading “Debt Instruments” for the definitions of the debt and convertible debt instruments to which we refer in this section, as well as the indentures and other agreements that govern them. As detailed in Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” in April 2019 and May 2019, we entered into financing transactions that extended the maturity of our senior secured indebtedness to 2024 and generated funds sufficient to repay, repurchase or retire our 2020 Convertible Notes (all of which we have repurchased). In August 2019, we entered into the ABL Credit Facility, which provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. The ABL Credit Agreement provides that the revolving line of credit may be increased by up to an additional $30.0 million under certain circumstances. Since March 2020, in order to enhance our liquidity in response to the uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made certain drawings and repayments under the revolving ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts were outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility and $21.9 million remained available for borrowing under the terms of the agreement that would allow for the company to meet the “payment conditions” criteria as described in the agreement. Our intent is to continue to access the capital markets to refinance our future debt obligations on an as-needed basis. Excluding the impact of our IPO, our prior credit facility, the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2020 Convertible Notes, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Facility, to date we have not generated positive cash flows. Additionally, as disclosed elsewhere in this report, the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and our financial and operational performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the timetable for administering and efficacy of vaccines, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If the recent recovery observed in the BA business does not continue, our liquidity and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. See “ Risk Factors─Risks Related to our Business─The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to combat it have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business .” As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $435.3 million. Based on our current plans, including the measures taken in our response to COVID-19 and the proceeds received in connection with the closing of the Transaction, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows provided by operating activities and access to the ABL credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating obligations, including our capital expenditure requirements, for the next twelve months. The 2024 Indenture and the ABL Credit Agreement contain covenants that limit the ability of GIH and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Further, market conditions and/or our financial performance may limit our access to additional sources of equity or debt financing, or our ability to pursue potential strategic alternatives. As a result, we may be unable to finance the growth of our business to the extent that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash generated through operating activities prove insufficient or we are unable to raise additional financing through the issuance of additional equity, permitted incurrences of debt by us or by GIH and its subsidiaries, or the pursuit of potential strategic alternatives. 55 Cash Flows The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Cash flows from continuing operations: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 4,513 $ (12,872 ) $ 1,892 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (8,990 ) 32,850 162,820 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 44,479 (2,830 ) 29,654 Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations 220,139 (30,339 ) (207,557 ) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash (1,946 ) (250 ) 578 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 258,195 (13,441 ) (12,613 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 177,675 191,116 203,729 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 435,870 $ 177,675 $ 191,116 Supplemental information: Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 435,870 $ 177,675 $ 191,116 Less: current restricted cash 525 560 1,535 Less: non-current restricted cash - 7,099 5,426 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 435,345 $ 170,016 $ 184,155 Short-term investments $ - $ - $ 39,323 Following is a discussion of the year-over-year changes in cash flow activities. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations: The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Net loss $ (48,559 ) $ (88,497 ) $ (52,460 ) Non-cash charges and credits 42,677 103,951 61,267 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 12,114 (28,326 ) (6,915 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations $ 6,232 $ (12,872 ) $ 1,892 For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $4.5 million, as compared with cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of $12.9 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the increase in operating cash flows were: • A $38.7 million increase in cash flows related to operating assets and liabilities resulting from: o An increase in cash flows primarily due to the following: ▪ Changes in accrued interest due to changes in the timing of payments as compared to the prior year; ▪ Changes in accounts receivable due primarily to the timing of collections and a decrease in revenue as a result of COVID-19; and ▪ Changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments. 56 o Partial o ffset s to the above due to a decrease in cash flows resulting from c hanges in contract assets primarily due to additional promotional sales programs in the current year as compared to the prior year . • Partially offset by a $21.3 million change in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, as noted above under “—Results of Operations.” For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $12.9 million, as compared with cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the decrease in operating cash flows were: • A $21.4 million decrease in cash flows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from: o A decrease in cash flows due to the following: ▪ Changes in accrued interest due to the timing of payments as compared to the prior year; and ▪ Changes in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of collections. o Partial offsets to the above due to increases in cash flows resulting from changes in inventories primarily due to decreased equipment purchases and an increase in equipment revenue during 2019 as compared with 2018. • Partially offset by a $6.6 million change in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, primarily due to an increased net loss in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt, as noted above under “—Results of Operations.” Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations: Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, while cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $32.9 million and $162.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Investing activities are comprised of capital expenditures related to software development, data center upgrades and cell site construction. Additionally, cash used in investing activities from continuing operations includes net changes in our short-term investments consisting of a cash inflow of $39.3 million and $173.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations: Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $44.5 million, primarily due to the $51.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of 2020 Additional Notes, offset by the repurchase of convertible notes, payments on finance leases and stock-based compensation activity. Cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.8 million, primarily due to the redemption of our outstanding 2022 Senior Secured Notes (including the make-whole premium payable under the indenture governing the 2022 Senior Secured Notes) for a redemption price totaling $741.4 million, the repurchase of $159.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes and the payment of $23.0 million of deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes, offset in part by $920.7 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes. Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $29.7 million, primarily due to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes with gross proceeds of $237.8 million, offset in part by $200.4 million of payments to repurchase 2020 Convertible Notes (comprised of $199.9 million of outstanding principal and $0.5 million of fees) and $8.1 million of debt issuance costs. 57 Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations: Cash provided by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $220.1 million as compared to cash used by discontinued operations of $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $250.4 million change was primarily due to a $464.0 million increase in cash provided by investing activities offset by a $214.1 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was due to the $386.3 million of proceeds received in the Transaction and a $79.9 million decrease in capital expenditures due to the impact of COVID-19 on the installation of CA equipment on airline partners’ aircraft. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $133.1 million increase in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, and an $81.0 million decrease in cash flows related to operating assets and liabilities primarily due to changes in accounts receivable, inventory, deferred lease proceeds and accrued liabilities, offset in part by changes in accounts payable and contract assets. Cash used by discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $30.3 million as compared to cash used by discontinued operations of $207.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $177.3 million change was primarily due to a $161.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities and a $14.5 million increase in cash provided by investing activities. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $105.2 million increase in cash flows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, resulting primarily from changes in inventory and accounts receivable, and a $56.0 million decrease in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, as noted above under “—Results of Operations.” The increase in cash provided by investing activities was due to a decrease in capital expenditures for the installation of CA equipment on airline partners’ aircraft. Capital Expenditures Our business requires significant capital expenditures, primarily for technology development, equipment and capacity expansion. For the periods presented in this report, capital expenditures for our former CA business, presented as discontinued operations, included the significant purchase of airborne equipment related to the roll out and/or upgrade of service to our former airline partners’ fleets. Capital spending for continuing operations for the periods presented in this report is associated with the expansion of our ATG network and data centers. We capitalized software development costs related to network technology solutions and new product/service offerings. We also capitalized costs related to the build-out of our office locations. Capital expenditures for our continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $9.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2020 as compared with 2019 was primarily due to an increase in capitalized software. We expect that our capital expenditures for our continuing operations will vary in the future depending on the timing of network-related capital expenditures as we build out Gogo 5G and further invest in capitalized software. Capital expenditures for our continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $6.5 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized software. Debt Instruments Following is a discussion of the debt instruments we had in place as of December 31, 2020 and which we utilized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. 2024 Senior Secured Notes On April 25, 2019 (the “Issue Date”), Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (“GIH”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo Finance” and, together with GIH, the “Issuers”) issued $905 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the “Initial Notes”) under an indenture (the “Base Indenture”), dated as of April 25, 2019, among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the “Initial 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with us, 58 the “Initial 2024 Guarantors”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”). On May 3, 2019, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the “First Supplemental Indenture”) to increase the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred under Credit Facilities (as defined in the 2024 Indenture) by GIH or its subsidiaries that are 2024 Guarantors (as defined below) by $20 million in aggregate principal amount. On March 6, 2020, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors, Gogo Air International GmbH (an indirect subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo International”) and the Trustee entered into a second supplemental indenture ( the “Second Supplemental Indenture”) to add Gogo International as a guarantor under the 2024 Indenture. On July 31, 2020, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors, Gogo International and Gogo Inflight Internet Canada Ltd., Gogo ATG LLC and Gogo CA Licenses LLC (collectively, the “Additional Guarantors” and, together with the Initial 2024 Guarantors and Gogo International, the “2024 Guarantors”) and the Trustee entered into a third supplemental indenture (the “Third Supplemental Indenture”) to add the Additional Guarantors as guarantors under the 2024 Indenture. On November 9, 2020, the Company, the Issuers, the 2024 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into a fourth supplemental indenture (together with the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture, the “2024 Indenture”) to increase the amount of indebtedness under the Credit Facilities (as defined in the Base Indenture) that may be incurred by the Issuers or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Base Indenture) by $50 million in aggregate principal amount. On May 7, 2019, the Issuers issued an additional $20 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the “2019 Additional Notes”). On November 13, 2020, the Issuers issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes (the “2020 Additional Notes” and, together with the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes, the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”). The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were offered and sole in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The Initial Notes were issued at a price equal to 99.512% of their face value, the 2019 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 100.5% of their face value, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $920.7 million and the 2020 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 103.5% of their face value, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $51.8 million. Additionally, we received approximately $0.1 million for interest that accrued from April 25, 2019 through May 7, 2019 with respect to the 2019 Additional Notes that was included in our interest payment on November 1, 2019. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Gogo Inc. and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Gogo Finance), subject to certain exceptions. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees are secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined below) and by first-priority liens on the Cash Flow Priority Collateral (as defined below), including pledged equity interests of the Issuers and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries guaranteeing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, except for certain excluded assets and subject to permitted liens. Upon the closing of the Transaction, certain subsidiaries were released from their guarantees under the 2024 Indenture, and certain of the ABL Priority Collateral and Cash Flow Priority Collateral were released. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $975 million and $925 million, respectively, the unaccreted debt discount was $1.5 million and $3.9 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount was $973.5 million and $921.1 million, respectively. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes to fund the redemption of all the outstanding 2022 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and to repurchase $159 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined below). The 2024 Senior Secured Notes will mature on May 1, 2024. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2019. We paid approximately $22.6 million of origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs. The deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet are being amortized over the contractual term of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $3.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred 59 financing costs related to th e 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $16.6 million and $ 19.7 million , respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet . See Note 10 , “Interest Costs , ” for additional information. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are the senior secured indebtedness of the Issuers and are: • effectively senior to (i) all of the Issuers’ existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) the Issuers’ indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility (as defined below) to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral; • effectively equal in right of payment with the Issuers’ existing and future (i) unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes; • structurally senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, including our 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes (each as defined below); • senior in right of payment to any and all of the Issuers’ future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes; • structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantors (other than the Issuers); and • effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness secured on a senior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of ABL Priority Collateral. Each guarantee is a senior secured obligation of such 2024 Guarantor and is: • effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future (i) senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the guarantee, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral; • effectively equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing such guarantee; • effectively subordinated to the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility of each 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such 2024 Guarantor; • effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness, if any, of such 2024 Guarantor; and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantor subsidiary. The security interests in certain collateral may be released without the consent of holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes if such collateral is disposed of in a transaction that complies with the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements, and if any grantor of such security interests is released from its obligations with respect to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements. Under certain circumstances, GIH and the 2024 Guarantors have the right to transfer certain intellectual property assets that on the Issue Date constitute collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the guarantees to a restricted subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland, resulting in the release of such collateral. In addition, the 2024 Indenture permits indebtedness incurred under the ABL Credit Facility to be secured on a first-priority basis by certain of the same collateral that secures the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. 60 The Issuers may redeem the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus the make-whole premium set forth in the 2024 Indenture as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption date. On or after May 1, 2021, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes will be redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record date on or prior to the redemption date to receive interest due on an interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period commencing on May 1 of the following years: Redemption Year Price 2021 104.938 % 2022 102.469 % 2023 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 109.875% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of redemption; provided, however , that 2024 Senior Secured Notes representing at least 50% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption. The 2024 Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers and the 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors and, in certain circumstances, our ability, to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of GIH’s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers or make other intercompany transfers; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain transactions with the Issuers’ affiliates. The 2024 Indenture also provides that if we complete certain sales or transfers of assets, we are required to apply the Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the Base Indenture) generated therefrom within 365 days to either permanently repay indebtedness, in accordance with the terms of the 2024 Indenture, or invest in property or non-current assets of a nature or type used in our, or a similar or related, business. If we do not so apply the Net Cash Proceeds from the Transaction by December 1, 2021, GIH will be required to make an offer to repurchase for cash an aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes equal to any Net Cash Proceeds not so applied as of such date, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. As a result, we have classified $341 million of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes as short-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020, representing the amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes potentially to be repurchased with the Net Cash Proceeds. Most of these covenants, including the covenant related to the application of Net Cash Proceeds from certain sales or transfers of assets, will cease to apply if, and for as long as, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes have investment grade ratings from both Moody’s Investment Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s. If we or the Issuers undergo specific types of change of control accompanied by a downgrade in the rating of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes prior to May 1, 2024, GIH is required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. The 2024 Indenture provides for events of default, which, if any of them occur, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes issued under the 2024 Indenture to be due and payable immediately. As of December 31, 2020, no event of default had occurred. ABL Credit Facility On August 26, 2019, Gogo Inc., GIH and Gogo Finance (together GIH and Gogo Finance are referred to as the “Borrowers”) entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) among the Borrowers, the other 61 loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”) , and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. , as syndication agent, which provides for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”) of up to $30 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. Borrowing availability under the ABL Credit Facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base collateral calculation that is based on specified percentages of the value of eligible accounts receivable (including eligible unbilled accounts receivable) and eligible credit card receivables, less certain reserves and subject to certain other adjustments as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Availability is reduced by issuance of letters of credit as well as any borrowings. As of December 31, 2020, the facility was undrawn and $21.9 million remained available for borrowing under the terms of the agreement that would allow for the company to meet the “payment conditions” criteria as described in our ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, the facility was undrawn. The final maturity of the ABL Credit Facility is August 26, 2022, unless the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) has not, on or prior to December 15, 2021, been repaid in full or refinanced with a new maturity date no earlier than February 26, 2023, in which case the final maturity date shall instead be December 16, 2021. Loans outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at the Borrowers’ option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio. Unused commitments under the ABL Credit Facility are subject to a per annum fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% depending on the average quarterly usage of the revolving commitments. The obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Gogo Inc. and all of its existing and future subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the “ABL Guarantors”), and such obligations and the obligations of the ABL Guarantors are secured on a (i) senior basis by a perfected security interest in all present and after-acquired inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, securities accounts, and any cash or other assets in such accounts and other related assets owned by each ABL Guarantor and the proceeds of the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions (the “ABL Priority Collateral”) and (ii) junior basis by a perfected security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets owned by each ABL Guarantor (the “Cash Flow Priority Collateral”). The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things: the incurrence of additional indebtedness; the incurrence of additional liens; dividends or other distributions on equity; the purchase, redemption or retirement of capital stock; the payment or redemption of certain indebtedness; loans, guarantees and other investments; entering into other agreements that create restrictions on the ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on equity, make or repay certain loans, create or incur certain liens or guarantee certain indebtedness; asset sales; sale-leaseback transactions; swap agreements; consolidations or mergers; amendment of certain material documents; certain regulatory matters; Canadian pension plans; and affiliate transactions. The negative covenants are subject to customary exceptions and also permit dividends and other distributions on equity, investments, permitted acquisitions and payments or redemptions of indebtedness upon satisfaction of the “payment conditions.” The payment conditions are deemed satisfied upon Specified Availability (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) on the date of the designated action and Specified Availability for the prior 30-day period exceeding agreed-upon thresholds, the absence of the occurrence and continuance of any default and, in certain cases, pro forma compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.10 to 1.00. The ABL Credit Agreement includes a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of no less than 1.00 to 1.00, which is tested only when Specified Availability is less than the greater of (A) $4.5 million and (B) 15.0% of the then effective commitments under the ABL Credit Facility, and continuing until the first day immediately succeeding the last day of the calendar month which includes the thirtieth (30th) consecutive day on which Specified Availability is in excess of such threshold so long as no default has occurred and is continuing and certain other conditions are met. As of December 31, 2020, Specified Availability had not fallen below the amount specified and 62 therefore the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test was not applicable. Full availability under the ABL Credit Facility may be limited by our ability to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio in future periods. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the ABL Credit Facility to be terminated. On August 26, 2019, the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors entered into an ABL collateral agreement (the “ABL Collateral Agreement”), in favor of the Administrative Agent, whereby the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors granted a security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of each Borrower and each ABL Guarantor, to secure all obligations of the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors under the ABL Credit Agreement, and U.S. Bank National Association, as cash flow collateral representative, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as ABL agent, entered into a crossing lien intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) to govern the relative priority of liens on the collateral that secures the ABL Credit Agreement and the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and certain other rights, priorities and interests. On November 30, 2020, the Issuers entered into a limited consent to the ABL Credit Agreement with the financial institutions listed on the signature pages thereof and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, pursuant to which the Lenders (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) provided consent to the consummation of the Transaction. 2022 Senior Secured Notes On June 14, 2016, the Issuers issued $525 million aggregate principal amount of 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the “Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes”) under an Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2016 (the “Original Indenture”), among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the “2022 Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with us, the “2022 Guarantors”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee and as Collateral Agent. On January 3, 2017, the Issuers issued $65 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the “January 2017 Additional Notes”). The January 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 108% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $70.2 million. On September 20, 2017, the Issuers, the 2022 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Original Indenture, the “Indenture”) to modify certain covenants, as discussed below. On September 25, 2017, the Issuers issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the “September 2017 Additional Notes”). The September 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 113% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $113.0 million. Additionally, we received approximately $2.9 million for interest that accrued from July 1, 2017 through September 24, 2017, which was paid in our January 2018 interest payment. We refer to the Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes, the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes collectively as the “2022 Senior Secured Notes.” On April 15, 2019, the Issuers elected to call for redemption in full all $690 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The redemption was conditioned, among other things, upon the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or from one or more other sources, in an amount satisfactory to the Issuers which condition was satisfied by the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. On April 25, 2019, the Issuers irrevocably deposited, or caused to be irrevocably deposited, with the Trustee funds solely for the benefit of the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, cash in an amount sufficient to pay principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the 2022 Senior Secured Notes to, but not including, the date of redemption and all other sums payable under the Indenture. The Trustee executed and delivered an acknowledgement of satisfaction, discharge and release, dated as of April 25, 2019, among other documents, with respect to the satisfaction and discharge of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. On May 15, 2019, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes were fully redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and the amount deposited with the Trustee on April 25, 2019 was paid to the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $51.4 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $9.1 million and the remaining debt premium of $11.7 million relating to the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in connection with the redemption thereof, 63 which together are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. We paid approximately $15.9 million of aggregate origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes which were accounted for as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we paid approximately $1.4 million of consent fees in connection with the Supplemental Indenture, which partially offset the net carrying value of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. Total amortization expense was $0.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs were written off as of May 15, 2019. 2022 Convertible Notes On November 21, 2018, we issued $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances described below. Upon maturity, we have the option to settle our obligation through cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2019. The $237.8 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $188.7 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $49.1 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, we must settle the 2022 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2022 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 8, “Interest Costs,” for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 13.6%. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding principal on the 2022 Convertible Notes was $237.8 million, the unaccreted debt discount was $22.7 million and $35.9 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $215.1 million and $201.9 million, respectively. We incurred approximately $8.1 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, of which $6.4 million and $1.7 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The $6.4 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $1.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2022 Convertible Notes was $2.7 million and $4.5 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, “Interest Costs,” for additional information. The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.00 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we currently expect to settle in shares for the amount of the 2022 64 Convertible Notes then outstanding. We may elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Holders may convert the 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time prior to January 15, 2022, but only in the following circumstances: • during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day (the “Stock Price Condition”); • during the five-business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2022 Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2022 Convertible Notes on each such trading day (the “Notes Price Condition”); or • upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Stock Price Condition was triggered for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2022 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after January 15, 2022 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2022. In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2022 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. 2020 Convertible Notes On March 3, 2015, we issued $340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $21.9 million was subsequently exercised during March 2015, resulting in a total issuance of $361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes. We paid interest on the 2020 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest payments began on September 1, 2015. In November 2018, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we repurchased $199.9 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes at par value. As a result of the repurchase, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $17.9 million to face value and included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. On April 18, 2019, we commenced a cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase any and all of the outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for an amount equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date on the 2020 Convertible Notes to, but not including, the date of payment for the 2020 Convertible Notes accepted in the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer expired on May 15, 2019, resulting in the purchase of $159.0 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. As a result of the Tender Offer, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $8.5 million to face value and unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.6 million were expensed. These two items are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. During September 2019, we purchased an additional $0.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes matured on March 1, 2020. 65 The $361.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $261.9 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $100.0 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes. If we or the holders of 2020 Convertible Notes elect ed not to settle the debt through conversion, we were required to settle the 2020 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component was accreted up to the face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes, which result ed in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 8 , “Interest Costs , ” for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2020 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 11.5%. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal on the 2020 Convertible Notes was $2.5 million, the unamortized debt discount was zero, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $2.5 million. We incurred approximately $10.4 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, of which $7.5 million and $2.9 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The $7.5 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2020 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was zero, $0.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2020 Convertible Notes was zero. See Note 10, “Interest Costs,” for additional information. The 2020 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 41.9274 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.85 per share of our common stock. We had the option to elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Forward Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we paid approximately $140 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the “Forward Transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “Forward Counterparties”), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to one of the Forward Transactions (the “Amended and Restated Forward Transaction”) to extend the expected settlement date with respect to approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock held by one of the Forward Counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the “2022 Forward Counterparty”), to correspond with the May 15, 2022 maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. In the future, we may request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the 2022 Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the 2022 Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The 2022 Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the 2022 Forward Counterparty on such terms as may be mutually agreed upon at the time. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders’ equity within our 66 consolidated balance sheet was reduced by approximately $140 million. Between March 5-6, 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. The approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transactions are treated as retired shares for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding . Restricted Cash Our restricted cash balances were $0.5 million and $7.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The balance as of December 31, 2020 consisted of a letter of credit issued for the benefit of the landlord of our current office location in Broomfield, CO. The balance as of December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of letters of credit for office locations in Broomfield, CO, Chicago, IL and Bensenville, IL as well as cash restricted to repay the remaining balance of the 2020 Convertible Notes which matured in March 2020. For additional information on the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the ABL Credit Facility, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes, see Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” to our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations (including those that require us to make future cash payments) as of December 31, 2020.

(3) Amounts represent obligations to provide services for which we have already received cash from our customers. (4) Other long-term obligations consist of estimated payments (undiscounted) for our asset retirement obligations, network transmission services and monthly C$0.1 million payments to the licensor of our Canadian ATG spectrum license over the estimated 25-year term of the agreement, using the December 31, 2020 exchange rate. Other long-term obligations do not include $2.1 million of deferred tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of their timing. Contractual Commitments: We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase satellite-based systems, certifications and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the equipment or certifications, or as development services are provided. 67 Leases and Cell Site Contracts: We have lease agreements relating to certain facilities and equipment, which are considered operating leases. See Note 17 , “Leases,” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Indemnifications and Guarantees : In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and debt. We have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments through a variety of securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, and money market funds. Our cash and cash equivalents as of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 primarily included amounts in bank deposit accounts and money market funds, and we did not have any short-term investments as of either such date. We believe that a change in average interest rates would not affect our interest income and results of operations by a material amount. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ. Interest: Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest income generated from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents as of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 included amounts in bank deposit accounts and money market funds. We believe we have minimal interest rate risk as a 10% decrease in the average interest rate on our portfolio would have reduced interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 by immaterial amounts. Inflation: We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. 68 Item 8. Financial Statemen ts and Supplementary Data Gogo Inc. Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Page No. Report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 70 Consolidated Balance Sheets 72 Consolidated Statements of Operations 73 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss 74 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 75 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) 76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 77 69 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Gogo Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gogo Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Accounting Principles Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases , using the modified retrospective approach. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 70 Revenue Recognition on Airline-Directed Contracts — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description Within the Commercial Aviation business, which is presented as discontinued operations, the Company’s airline-directed contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which primarily include the sale of equipment, installation services, connectivity services, and entertainment services. The Company allocated the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price. The contractual consideration used for allocation purposes includes connectivity and entertainment services, which may be based on a fixed monthly fee per aircraft or a variable fee based on the volume of connectivity activity, or a combination of both. Examples of variable consideration in the contracts include megabyte overages and pay-per-use sessions . The Company constrained its estimates to reduce the probability of a significant revenue reversal in future periods, allocated variable consideration to identified performance obligations, and recognized revenue in the period the services were provided. The estimates were based on historical experience, anticipated future performance, market conditions, and management’s best judgments at the time. The estimates included management’s best assumptions for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included decreased flights and gross passenger opportunity. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could have affected the estimated contract revenue. For example, estimates of variable revenue within certain contracts required estimation of the number of sessions or megabytes that would be purchased over the contract term and the average revenue per connectivity session, which varies based on the connectivity options available to passengers on each airline. Estimated revenue under these contracts anticipated increases in take rates over time and assumed an average revenue per session consistent with historical experience. The Company regularly reviewed and updated its estimates, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and recognized adjustments under the cumulative catch-up method. Any adjustments under this method were recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period identified and revenue for future periods was recognized using the new adjusted estimate. Given the judgment necessary to estimate gross passenger opportunity, the take rate, and the average revenue per session assumptions, auditing such estimates required increased audit effort due to the complexity of the airline-directed contracts and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the Company’s estimated gross passenger opportunity, take rate, and average revenue per session assumptions included the following, among others: • For a sample of contracts: – We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasted gross passenger opportunity rates by comparing the forecasted rates to external airline industry data. – We compared the historical gross passenger opportunity rates, take rates, and average revenue per session amounts to the Company’s prior estimates to evaluate management’s ability to accurately forecast these assumptions. – We compared the historical take rates and the average revenue per session amounts to the Company’s future estimates and evaluated the basis for expected future changes. – We evaluated gross passenger opportunity, the take rate, and the average revenue per session assumptions for consistency with information within the details of the company-wide internal financial forecasts. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Chicago, Illinois March 11, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007. 71 Gogo Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands, except share and per share data) December 31, December 31, 2020 2019 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 435,345 $ 170,016 Accounts receivable, net of allowances of $ 1,044 and $ 660 , respectively 39,833 42,322 Inventories 28,114 35,205 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 8,934 6,813 Current assets of discontinued operations — 170,469 Total current assets 512,226 424,825 Non-current assets: Property and equipment, net 63,493 69,183 Intangible assets, net 52,693 51,803 Operating lease right-of-use assets 33,690 35,807 Other non-current assets , net of allowances of $ 375 and $ 0 , respectively 11,486 12,121 Non-current assets of discontinued operations — 620,961 Total non-current assets 161,362 789,875 Total assets $ 673,588 $ 1,214,700 Liabilities and stockholders’ deficit Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 11,013 $ 5,495 Accrued liabilities 83,009 48,070 Deferred revenue 3,113 2,225 Current portion of long-term debt 341,000 — Current liabilities of discontinued operations — 196,852 Total current liabilities 438,135 252,642 Non-current liabilities: Long-term debt 827,968 1,101,248 Non-current operating lease liabilities 38,018 42,016 Other non-current liabilities 10,581 7,531 Non-current liabilities of discontinued operations — 210,153 Total non-current liabilities 876,567 1,360,948 Total liabilities 1,314,702 1,613,590 Commitments and contingencies (Note 18) — — Stockholders’ deficit Common stock, par value $ 0.0001 per share; 500,000,000 shares authorized at December 31, 2020 and 2019; 91,086,191 and 88,292,821 shares issued at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively; and 85,990,499 and 88,240,877 shares outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively 9 9 Additional paid-in capital 1,088,590 979,499 Accumulated other comprehensive loss ( 1,013 ) ( 2,256 ) Treasury stock, at cost ( 98,857 ) — Accumulated deficit ( 1,629,843 ) ( 1,376,142 ) Total stockholders’ deficit ( 641,114 ) ( 398,890 ) Total liabilities and stockholders’ deficit $ 673,588 $ 1,214,700 See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 72 Gogo Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands, except per share amounts) For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Revenue: Service revenue $ 211,987 $ 221,922 $ 196,377 Equipment revenue 57,731 87,063 93,776 Total revenue 269,718 308,985 290,153 Operating expenses: Cost of service revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 45,073 42,142 37,139 Cost of equipment revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 39,299 51,744 55,416 Engineering, design and development 25,227 26,013 18,519 Sales and marketing 15,135 21,236 24,396 General and administrative 54,467 54,628 57,903 Depreciation and amortization 14,166 16,690 14,363 Total operating expenses 193,367 212,453 207,736 Operating income 76,351 96,532 82,417 Other (income) expense: Interest income ( 722 ) ( 4,000 ) ( 4,122 ) Interest expense 125,787 130,473 122,620 Loss on extinguishment of debt -

Background Gogo (“we”, “us,” “our”) i s the world’s largest provider of broadband connectivity services for the business aviation market. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every passenger on every flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated air-to-ground (“ATG”) networks, engineer, install and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software, and deliver customizable connectivity and wireless entertainment services and global support capabilities to our aviation partners. Our services include satellite-based voice and data services through our strategic alliances with satellite providers. On December 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our commercial aviation (“CA”) business to a subsidiary of Intelsat Jackson Holdings S.A. (“Intelsat”) for a purchase price of $ 400 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the “Transaction”). At the closing of the Transaction, the parties entered into certain ancillary agreements, including a transition services agreement, an intellectual property license agreement and commercial agreements. These agreements include an ATG network sharing agreement, pursuant to which we provide certain inflight connectivity services on our current ATG network and, when available, our Gogo 5G network, subject to certain revenue sharing obligations. Under the ATG network sharing agreement, Intelsat will have exclusive access to the ATG network for commercial aviation in North America, subject to minimum revenue guarantees starting at $ 5 million in the first year of the agreement. As a result of the Transaction, the CA business is reported in discontinued operations and all periods presented in this Form 10-K have been conformed to present the CA business as a discontinued operation. We report the financial results of discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. Discontinued operations reporting occurs only when the disposal of a component or a group of components (i) meets the held-for-sale classification criteria or is disposed of by sale or other than by sale, and (ii) represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. The results of operations and cash flows of a discontinued operation are restated for all comparative periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, discussion in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refers to our continuing operations. Refer to Note 2, “Discontinued Operations” for further information. As a result of the Transaction, our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and business results for our operations, and makes resource and operating decisions, on a consolidated basis. As such, we do not present segment information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Note 13, “Business Segments and Major Customers,” for further information. 77 2. Discontinued Operations As discussed in Note 1, “Background,” on December 1, 2020, we completed the sale of our CA business to Intelsat. As a result of the Transaction, the CA business is reported for all periods as discontinued operations. The following table summarizes the results of discontinued operations which are presented as Net loss from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Revenue: Service revenue $ 192,616 $ 442,431 $ 433,770 Equipment revenue 40,483 84,310 169,841 Total revenue 233,099 526,741 603,611 Operating expenses: Cost of service revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 145,958 255,706 254,503 Cost of equipment revenue (exclusive of items shown below) 33,978 82,984 166,828 Engineering, design and development 57,167 82,597 101,571 Sales and marketing 24,121 27,920 34,427 General and administrative 40,551 35,215 36,366 Impairment of long-lived assets 47,375 - - Depreciation and amortization 119,827 102,127 119,254 Total operating expenses 468,977 586,549 712,949 Operating loss ( 235,878 ) ( 59,808 ) ( 109,338 ) Other (income) expense: Gain on sale of CA business ( 37,958 ) - - Other (income) expense 3,134 ( 2,744 ) 172 Total other (income) expense: ( 34,824 ) ( 2,744 ) 172 Loss before income taxes ( 201,054 ) ( 57,064 ) ( 109,510 ) Income tax provision 423 443 61 Net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ ( 201,477 ) $ ( 57,507 ) $ ( 109,571 ) The following discussion relates entirely to discontinued operations. Gain on sale – Upon the closing of the Transaction on December 1, 2020, we received initial gross proceeds of $ 386.3 million, which reflects the $ 400.0 million purchase price, adjusted for cash, debt, transaction expenses and working capital. The final purchase price remains subject to change due to customary post-closing purchase price adjustment procedures set forth in the purchase and sale agreement between Gogo and Intelsat, that are not yet complete. In February 2021, Intelsat delivered a draft closing statement that would reduce the working capital portion of the purchase price computation by $ 9.4 million, which would result in Gogo returning to Intelsat $9.4 million of the initial gross proceeds. Gogo is reviewing Intelsat’s draft closing statement in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement. As this post-closing purchase price adjustment is not yet finalized and therefore represents a contingent gain, $ 9.4 million has been recorded as a deferred gain on sale included within Accrued liabilities. As a result, we have recognized within Gain on sale of CA business a pretax gain on sale of $ 38.0 million, computed as the $386.3 million of initial gross proceeds less (i) the potential $ 9.4 million post-closing purchase price adjustment not yet finalized, (ii) the carrying value of the assets and liabilities transferred in the Transaction and (iii) Transaction-related costs. Change in estimates – During the second quarter of 2020, our agreement with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) to provide 2Ku service on certain Delta aircraft was amended to change the contract expiration date from February 2027 with respect to all aircraft to a staggered, fleet by fleet expiration schedule under which expiration dates will occur between November 2020 and July 2022 (the “Delta amendment”). As a result, the useful lives of the equipment installed on these fleets were shortened to align with the expiration dates in the amended agreement. The change in estimated useful lives resulted in approximately $ 41 million of accelerated depreciation during the year ended December 31, 2020. We ceased depreciating these assets and other depreciable assets included as part of 78 discontinued operations when the CA business was classified as held for sale. Additionally, the amortization periods for the remaining deferred airborne lease incentives associated with the equipment installed on the 2Ku fleets were shortened to align with the new expiration dates, which resulted in approximately $ 42 million of accelerated amortization during the year ended December 31 , 2020. Amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives is a reduction to cost of service revenue. Credit Losses – During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $ 10.7 million of provisions for expected credit losses, primarily related to one international airline partner entering bankruptcy administration, while we had recoveries of approximately $ 0.6 million. See “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 3, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for additional information. Arrangements with commercial airlines – For our divested CA business, pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we placed our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines in order to deliver our service to passengers on the aircraft. We had two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. Under the airline-directed model, we transferred control of the equipment to the airline and therefore the airline was our customer in these transactions. Under the turnkey model, we had not transferred control of our equipment to our airline partner and, as a result, the airline passenger was deemed to be our customer. Transactions with our airline partners under the turnkey model were accounted for as an operating lease of space on an aircraft. We recognized $ 71.2 million, $ 28.6 million and $ 31.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 as a reduction to our cost of service revenue from the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the Delta amendment. Under the turnkey model, the revenue share paid to our airline partners represented operating lease payments. These payments were deemed to be contingent rental payments as the payments due to each airline were based on a percentage of our CA service revenue generated from that airline’s passengers, which was unknown until realized. Therefore, we estimated the lease payments due to an airline at the commencement of our contract with such airline. This rental expense is included in cost of service revenue and is partially offset by the amortization of the deferred airborne lease incentives discussed above. Due to the accelerated amortization resulting from the Delta amendment and a significant reduction in revenue share as a result of COVID-19, the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives exceeded our revenue share expense by $ 49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We incurred net rental expense of $ 25.1 million and $ 24.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Asset impairment – We reviewed our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and other non-current assets, for potential impairment whenever events indicated that the carrying amount of such assets might not be recoverable. We performed this review by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. We grouped certain long-lived assets by airline contract and by technology. If we determined that an impairment existed, the amount of the impairment was computed as the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its estimated fair value, following which the assets were written down to their estimated fair values. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on air travel, including decreased flights, decreased gross passenger opportunity and our airline partners’ temporary parking of a significant number of their aircraft, we conducted a review as of March 31, 2020 and determined that the carrying values for the asset groups related to three of our airline agreements for the CA business exceeded their estimated undiscounted cash flows, which triggered the need to estimate the fair value of these assets. Fair value reflects our best estimate of the discounted cash flows of the impaired assets. For the airborne assets and right-of-use assets associated with the three airline agreements (the “impaired assets”), we recorded an impairment charge of $ 46.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2020, reflecting the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the impaired assets. We conducted another review as of June 30, 2020 due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the signing of the Delta amendment and determined that $ 1.0 million of deferred STC costs was impaired due to the bankruptcy of three airline partners. As such, we recorded a $ 1.0 million charge for impairment of long-lived assets for the three-month period ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, charges recorded for impairments of long-lived assets totaled $ 47.4 million. No such charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. 79 Revenue Recognition We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). CA’s airline-directed contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which primarily include the sale of equipment, installation services, connectivity services and entertainment services. For these contracts, we accounted for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocated the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which was based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer, if available. To the extent a good or service was not sold separately, we used our best estimate of the standalone selling price and maximized the use of observable inputs. The primary method we used to estimate the standalone selling price was the expected cost-plus margin approach. The contractual consideration used for allocation purposes includes connectivity and entertainment services, which may be based on a fixed monthly fee per aircraft or a variable fee based on the volume of connectivity activity, or a combination of both. Examples of variable consideration within CA’s airline contracts include megabyte overages and pay-per-use sessions. We constrained our estimates to reduce the probability of a significant revenue reversal in future periods, allocated variable consideration to the identified performance obligations and recognized revenue in the period the services were provided. Our estimates were based on historical experience, anticipated future performance, market conditions and our best judgment at the time. For 2020, our estimates included management’s best assumptions for the continued impact of COVID-19, which included decreased flights and gross passenger opportunity (“GPO”). A significant change in one or more of these estimates could have affected estimated contract value. For example, estimates of variable revenue within certain contracts required estimation of the number of sessions or megabytes that would be purchased over the contract term and the average revenue per connectivity session, which varies based on the connectivity options available to passengers on each airline. Estimated revenue under these contracts anticipated increases in take rates over time and assumed an average revenue per session consistent with our historical experience. We regularly reviewed and updated our estimates, especially in light of COVID-19, and recognized adjustments under the cumulative catch-up method. Any adjustments under this method were recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period identified and revenue for future periods was recognized using the new adjusted estimate. Stock-based compensation – In August 2020, the compensation committee of our Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) approved modifications to the vesting conditions and exercise periods of outstanding equity compensation awards held by certain of our then-current employees who became employees of Intelsat in the Transaction. These modifications became effective upon the consummation of the Transaction. Pursuant to such modifications, the options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) held by Intelsat employees generally vest on the earlier of (i) the original vesting date and (ii) November 30, 2021; provided that the employee does not voluntarily resign from and is not terminated for cause by Intelsat prior to such date. Certain of these awards vest based on conditions that are not classified as a service, market or performance condition and as a result such awards are classified as a liability. All costs related to stock-based compensation for our prior employees who became employees of Intelsat in the Transaction have been recognized as of December 31, 2020. 80 The following is a summary of our stock-based compensation expense by operating expense line contained within the results of discontinued operations for the years December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands) : 2020 2019 2018 Cost of service revenue $ 7,647 $ 1,497 $ 1,659 Cost of equipment revenue - - - Engineering, design and development 5,836 2,398 2,626 Sales and marketing 7,911 2,144 2,513 General and administrative 4,413 1,819 1,577 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 25,807 $ 7,858 $ 8,375 For additional information on our stock-based compensation plans, see Note 15, “Employee Retirement and Postretirement Benefits.” 3 . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the significant estimates and bases such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Significant Risks and Uncertainties - Our operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those associated with continuing losses, fluctuations in operating results, funding of our growth, implementation of our technology roadmap, strategic alliances, relationships with customers, suppliers and dealers, financing terms that may restrict operations, regulatory issues, competition, COVID-19, the economy, technology trends and evolving industry standards. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments - We consider cash and cash equivalents to be short-term, highly liquid investments that have the following characteristics: readily convertible to known amounts of cash, so near their maturities that there is insignificant risk of changes in value due to any changes in market interest rates, and having maturities of three months or less when purchased. We continually monitor positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which we invest. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets. We consider short-term investments to be investments with maturities of twelve months or less (but greater than three months). Certain cash amounts are restricted as to use and are classified outside of cash and cash equivalents. See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” for further details. Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. All cash and cash equivalents are invested with creditworthy financial institutions. Income Tax - We use an asset- and liability-based approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets which are not likely to be realized. On a regular basis, management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance. 81 We also consider the existence of any uncertain tax positions and, as necessary, provide a reserve for any uncertain tax positions at each reporting date. See Note 16, “Income Tax,” for further details. Inventories - Inventories consist primarily of telecommunications systems and parts and are recorded at the lower of average cost or market. We evaluate the need for write-downs associated with obsolete, slow-moving and nonsalable inventory by reviewing net realizable inventory values on a periodic basis. See Note 6, “Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts,” for further details. Property and Equipment and Depreciation - Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Network asset inventory and construction in progress, which include materials, transmission and related equipment, interest and other costs relating to the construction and development of our network, are not depreciated until they are put into service. Network equipment consists of switching equipment, antennas, base transceiver stations, site preparation costs, and other related equipment used in the operation of our network. Depreciation expense totaled $ 14.2 million, $ 16.7 million and $ 14.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for owned assets, which are as follows: Office equipment, furniture, fixtures and other 3-7 years Leasehold improvements 3-13 years Network equipment 5-25 years See Note 6, “Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts,” for further details. Improvements to leased property are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease. We reassess the useful lives of leasehold improvements when there are changes to the terms of the underlying lease. Such reassessment has resulted in the useful life of specific assets being adjusted to a shorter period than originally estimated, resulting in an increase in annual depreciation expense for those assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Software Development Costs - We capitalize costs for network and non-network software developed or obtained for internal use during the application development stage. These costs include purchased software and direct costs associated with the development and configuration of internal use software that supports the operation of our service offerings. These costs are included in goodwill and intangible assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheets and, when the software is placed in service, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Costs incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. With respect to software sold as part of our equipment sales, we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility has been established. Such capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, based on the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight-line method. Intangible Assets - Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Our FCC Licenses ( as defined in Note 8, “Intangible Assets” ) are our only indefinite-lived intangible assets. We perform our annual impairment test of our FCC Licenses during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of impairment. Our qualitative analysis includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environment, industry and market conditions, financial performance versus budget and any other events or circumstances specific to goodwill and the FCC Licenses. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the FCC Licenses is greater than the carrying value, no further testing is required. Otherwise, we will apply the quantitative impairment test method. 82 Our quantitative impairment testing of the FCC Licenses uses the Greenfield method, an income-based approach. When performing this quantitative impairment testing, we estimate the fair value of the FCC Licenses asset balances based primarily on projected future operating results, discounted cash flows, and other assumptions. Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, projected operating results and cash flows may not always be achieved. The failure to achieve one or more of our assumptions regarding projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term could reduce the estimated fair value below carrying value and result in the recognition of an impairment charge. The results of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments for 2020, 2019 and 2018 indicated no impairment. Intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are amortized over their useful lives as follows: Software 3-8 years OEM and dealer relationships 10 years Service customer relationships 5-7 years Other intangible assets 4-10 years See Note 8, “Intangible Assets,” for further details. Long-Lived Assets - We review our long-lived assets to determine potential impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We do this by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. If we determine an impairment exists, the asset is written down to estimated fair value. There were no impairments of long-lived assets in 2020, 2019 or 2018. Revenue Recognition - Our revenue is primarily earned from providing connectivity and entertainment services and through sales of equipment. Service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services and is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Equipment revenue primarily consists of proceeds from the sale of ATG and satellite connectivity equipment and the sale of entertainment equipment and is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped to OEMs and dealers. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: • Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; • Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; • Determination of the transaction price; • Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and • Recognition of revenue as we satisfy the performance obligations. See Note 5, “Revenue Recognition,” for further information. Research and Development Costs - Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and totaled $ 25.2 million, $ 26.0 million and $ 18.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Research and development costs are reported as engineering, design and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. 83 Warranty - We provide warranties on parts and labor related to our products. Our warranty terms range from two to five years. Warranty reserves are established for costs that are estimated to be incurred after the sale, delivery and installation of the products under warranty. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence, and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6, “Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts,” for the details of the changes in our warranty reserve. Asset Retirement Obligations - We have certain asset retirement obligations related to contractual commitments to remove our network equipment and other assets from leased cell sites upon termination of the site leases. The asset retirement obligations are classified as a noncurrent liability in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6, “Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts,” for the details of the changes in our asset retirement obligations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - We group financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value into three levels of hierarchy based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. See Note 12, “Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities,” for further information. Derivatives - In March 2015, we entered into the Forward Transactions (as defined and described in Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities”) in which we purchased 7.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $ 140 million, with an expected settlement date on or around March 13, 2020 , and in December 2019, we amended a portion of the Forward Transactions to extend the expected settlement date for approximately 2.1 million of those shares to on or around May 15, 2022 . During March 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions (as defined and described in Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities”). We accounted for these shares as Treasury Stock and reclassified $ 98.9 million from Additional Paid-In Capital to Treasury Stock, at cost, in our consolidated balance sheets. Because the Forward Transactions are indexed to our own stock and classified within stockholders’ equity, we do not account for the Forward Transactions as derivative instruments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 815, Derivatives and Hedging . See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” Note 11, “Common Stock and Preferred Stock,” and Note 12, “Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities,” for further information. Convertible Notes – Proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities”) were initially allocated between a liability component (long-term debt) and an equity component (additional paid-in capital), within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes. See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” for further information. Net Loss Per Share - We calculate basic and diluted net loss per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. See Note 4, “Net Loss Per Share,” for further information. Stock-Based Compensation Expense - Compensation cost is measured and recognized at fair value for all stock-based payments, including stock options. For time-based vesting stock options, we estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest 84 rate, expected life, and dividends. Forfeitures are rec ognized when they occur. RSUs and restricted stock are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. For awards with a market condition (which we have used on a limited basis ) , we estimated fair value using the Monte Carlo Simulation model, which requires assumptions, such as volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life and dividends . Our stock -based compensation expense is recognized over the applicable vesting period and is included in the same operating expense line items in the consolidated statements of operations as the base cash compensation paid to the underlying employees . See Note 14, “Stock-Based Compensation,” for further information. Leases – We account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”), adopted on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. As a result, we recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 842 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. Our historical financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the lease accounting standard in effect for those periods. We have operating lease agreements for which w e have recorded lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for leases primarily related to cell sites, office buildings, warehouses and computer and office equipment. We determine whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception and calculate the lease liability and right-of-use asset using our incremental borrowing rate. Our cell site leases generally have terms of five to ten years , with renewal options for an additional five to 25 years. For certain cell sites, the renewal options are deemed to be reasonably certain to be exercised. Our building leases generally range from one to ten years , with renewal options for an additional one to five years . We recognize operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have finance leases for computer and office equipment. Covenants within the 2024 Senior Secured Notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to enter into new finance lease arrangements. See Note 17, “Leases,” for further information. Advertising Costs - Costs for advertising are expensed as incurred. Debt Issuance Costs - We defer loan origination fees and financing costs related to our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we defer fees paid directly to the lenders related to amendments of our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. We amortize these costs over the term of the underlying debt obligation using the effective interest method and include them in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The fees incurred but not paid directly to the lenders in connection with amendments are expensed as incurred to interest expense. Deferred financing costs associated with future debt issuances are written off in the period during which we determine that the debt will no longer be issued. See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities” for further information. Comprehensive Loss - Comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is net loss plus unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Accounting standards adopted: On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. 85 The cumulative effect adjustment from using the modified retrospective approach for the adoption of ASC 326 impacted our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2020 by the recognition of allowance for credit losses as summarized below: Balance at December 31, 2019 Impact of ASC 326 Balances with Adoption of ASC 326 Assets Accounts receivable $ 42,322 $ ( 404 ) $ 41,918 Other non-current assets $ 12,121 $ ( 75 ) $ 12,046 Equity Accumulated deficit (1) $ ( 1,376,142 ) $ ( 3,665 ) $ ( 1,379,807 ) (1) The $ 3.7 million impact of the adoption of ASC 326 is comprised of $ 0.5 million for our continuing operations related to accounts receivable and $ 3.2 million for our discontinued operations comprised of $ 1.0 million related to accounts receivable, $ 0.4 million related to prepaid and other current assets, and $ 1.8 million related to other non-current assets. See Note 7, “Composition of Certain Reserves and Allowances,” for additional information. On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”), which requires an entity in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which modifies the disclosure requirements related to recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements. Currently all of our fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and, as such, the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 12, “Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities,” for additional information. On January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 , Leases (“ASC 842”), using the modified retrospective approach. As a result, we recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 842 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. Our historical financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the lease accounting standard in effect for those periods. We elected the practical expedients regarding use of hindsight to evaluate lease terms as well as maintaining lease classifications established under the prior lease accounting standard. Through this practical expedient, we did not reevaluate contracts to determine if they contained a lease. We did not elect the practical expedients regarding short-term leases or the separation of lease and non-lease components. Adoption of ASC 842 had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet through recognition of right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. Adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or our consolidated statements of cash flows and did not result in the recognition of incremental finance leases, formerly referred to as capital leases. 86 The discount rate used to calculate the adjustment to the opening balance was our incremental borrowing rate as of the adoption date, January 1, 2019. The cumulative effect of the adoption of ASC 842 to our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019 was as follows ( in thousands) : Balance at December 31, 2018 Impact of ASC 842 Balances with Adoption of ASC 842 Assets Operating lease right-of-use assets $ – $ 72,188 $ 72,188 Liabilities Accrued liabilities 213,111 9,019 222,130 Non-current operating lease liabilities – 102,440 102,440 Other non-current liabilities 80,191 ( 36,178 ) 44,013 Equity Accumulated deficit ( 1,228,674 ) ( 3,093 ) ( 1,231,767 ) See Note 17, “Leases,” for additional information. All other new pronouncements: In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic740) , which removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted. Amendments are to be applied prospectively, except for certain amendments that are to be applied either retrospectively or with a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings. We do not currently believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates. This guidance is effective beginning on March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain convertible instruments by removing the separation models for convertible debt with a cash conversion feature or convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments by requiring the use of the if-converted method. The treasury stock method is no longer available. This guidance is effective beginning on January 1, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have upon our consolidated financial statements. 4. Net Loss Per Share Basic and diluted net loss per share have been calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The shares of common stock effectively repurchased in connection with the Forward Transactions (as defined and described in Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities”) are considered participating securities requiring the two-class method to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share. Net earnings in future periods will be 87 allocated between common shares and participating securities. In periods of a net loss, the shares associated with the Forward Transactions will not receive an allocation of losses, as the counterparties to the Forward Transactions are not required to fund losses. Additionally, the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as of December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 excludes approximately 2.1 million , 7.2 million and 7.2 million shares , respectively, associated with the Forward Transactions . As a result of the net loss for each of the year s ended December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 for the periods where such shares or securities were outstanding, all of the outstanding shares of common stock underlying stock options, deferred stock units and restricted stock units were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding because they were anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018; however, because of the undistributed losses, the shares associated with the Forward Transactions are excluded from the computation of basic earnings per share as undistributed losses are not allocated to these shares ( in thousands, except per share amounts ): For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Net loss from continuing operations $ ( 48,559 ) $ ( 88,497 ) $ ( 52,460 ) Net loss from discontinued operations ( 201,477 ) ( 57,507 ) ( 109,571 ) Net loss ( 250,036 ) ( 146,004 ) ( 162,031 ) Less: Participation rights of the Forward Transactions — — — Undistributed losses $ ( 250,036 ) $ ( 146,004 ) $ ( 162,031 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding- basic and diluted 82,266 80,766 80,038 Net loss attributable to common stock per share- basic and diluted: Net loss from continuing operations $ ( 0.59 ) $ ( 1.10 ) $ ( 0.66 ) Net loss from discontinued operations ( 2.45 ) ( 0.71 ) ( 1.36 ) Net loss $ ( 3.04 ) $ ( 1.81 ) $ ( 2.02 ) 5 . Revenue Recognition Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the transaction price in our customer contracts allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations was approximately $ 71 million. Approximately $ 69 million primarily represents connectivity and entertainment service revenues which are recognized as services are provided, which is expected to occur through the remaining term of the contract. The remaining $ 2 million of such amount represents future equipment revenue that is expected to be recognized within the next year . We have excluded from this amount consideration from contracts that have an original duration of one year or less. 88 Disaggregation of revenue The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by category (in thousands) : For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Service revenue Connectivity $ 209,160 $ 219,450 $ 195,022 Entertainment and other 2,827 2,472 1,355 Total service revenue $ 211,987 $ 221,922 $ 196,377 Equipment revenue ATG $ 45,200 $ 62,899 $ 72,159 Satellite 11,746 21,755 18,165 Other 785 2,409 3,452 Total equipment revenue $ 57,731 $ 87,063 $ 93,776 Customer type Aircraft owner/operator $ 211,987 $ 221,922 $ 196,377 OEM and aftermarket dealer 57,731 87,063 93,776 Total revenue $ 269,718 $ 308,985 $ 290,153 Contract balances Our current and non-current deferred revenue balances totaled $ 3.1 million and $ 2.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

Composition of Certain Reserves and Allowances Credit Losses — We regularly evaluate our accounts receivable and contract assets for expected credit losses. Our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of each customer’s trade accounts receivables. Due to the short-term nature of such receivables, the estimated amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected is based on the aging of the accounts receivable balances and the financial condition of customers. Additionally, specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. Our monitoring activities include timely account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of each customer’s financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible. We apply a similar methodology to our current and non-current contract asset balances. However, due to the inherent additional risk associated with a long-term receivable, an additional provision for credit loss is applied to contract asset balances that will diminish over time as the contract nears its expiration date. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also considered the current and estimated future economic and market conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in the determination of our estimated credit losses. Estimates are used to determine the expected loss allowances. Such allowances are based on management’s assessment of anticipated payment, taking into account available historical and current information as well as management’s assessment of potential future developments. We are continuously monitoring our assumptions used to determine our expected credit losses, including the impact of COVID-19, which could cause us to record additional material credit losses in future periods. A summary of our allowances for credit losses were as follows ( in thousands ): For the year ended December 31, 2020 Other Accounts non-current Receivable assets Balance at January 1, 2020 $ 660 $ - Cumulative-effect adjustment of ASC 326 adoption 404 75 Current-period provision for expected credit losses 771 300 Write-offs charged against the allowances ( 727 ) - Other ( 64 ) - Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 1,044 $ 375 91 Warranties — We provide warranties on parts and labor related to our products. Our warranty terms range from two to five years . Warranty reserves are established for costs that are estimated to be incurred after the sale, delivery and installation of the products under warranty. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence, and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in our warranty reserve for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 consist of the following ( in thousands ): Warranty Reserve Balance – January 1, 2019 $ 1,800 Accruals for warranties issued 791 Settlements of warranties ( 91 ) Balance – December 31, 2019 2,500 Accruals for warranties issued ( 7 ) Settlements and adjustments to warranties ( 93 ) Balance – December 31, 2020 $ 2,400 8. Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are comprised of indefinite- and finite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. We own the rights to 3MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800 MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (the “3 MHz FCC License”), which is used in the operation of our ATG network, and the license for 1 MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (the “1 MHz FCC License”) acquired as part of our acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC. Together we refer to the 3 MHz FCC License and the 1 MHz FCC License as the “FCC Licenses.” The FCC Licenses were originally issued with 10 -year terms and we have renewed both licenses for subsequent 10 -year terms. Such licenses are subject to further renewal by the FCC, and renewals of licenses held by others have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that limit the useful life of the FCC Licenses. As a result, the FCC Licenses are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets which we do not amortize. We reevaluate the useful life of the FCC Licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Our annual impairment assessment of the FCC Licenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 indicated no impairment. Our software relates to the development of internal use software which is used to run our network and support our service offerings. Software also includes software embedded in the equipment that we sell to our customers. Our goodwill balance was $ 0.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. 92 Our intangible assets, other than goodwill, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows ( in thousands, except for weighted average remaining useful life ): Weighted Average As of December 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2019 Remaining Gross Net Gross Net Useful Life Carrying Accumulated Carrying Carrying Accumulated Carrying (in years) Amount Amortization Amount Amount Amortization Amount Amortized intangible assets: Software 2.4 $ 50,029 $ ( 31,739 ) $ 18,290 $ 42,591 $ ( 25,191 ) $ 17,400 Other intangible assets 9.0 1,500 - 1,500 1,500 - 1,500 Service customer relationships 8,081 ( 8,081 ) - 8,081 ( 8,081 ) - OEM and dealer relationships 6,724 ( 6,724 ) - 6,724 ( 6,724 ) - Total amortized intangible assets 66,334 ( 46,544 ) 19,790 58,896 ( 39,996 ) 18,900 Unamortized intangible assets: FCC Licenses 32,283 - 32,283 32,283 - 32,283 Total intangible assets $ 98,617 $ ( 46,544 ) $ 52,073 $ 91,179 $ ( 39,996 ) $ 51,183 Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 6.3 million, $ 6.1 million and $ 4.5 million, respectively.

Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities Long-term debt as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, December 31, 2020 2019 2024 Senior Secured Notes $ 973,539 $ 921,137 2022 Convertible Notes 215,122 201,868 2020 Convertible Notes - 2,498 Total debt 1,188,661 1,125,503 Less deferred financing costs ( 19,693 ) ( 24,255 ) Less current portion of long-term debt ( 341,000 ) — Total long-term debt $ 827,968 $ 1,101,248 93 2024 Senior Secured Notes On April 25, 2019 (the “Issue Date”), Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (“GIH”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo Finance” and, together with GIH, the “Issuers”) issued $ 905 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875 % senior secured notes due 2024 (the “Initial Notes”) under an indenture (the “Base Indenture”), dated as of April 25, 2019, among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the “Initial 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with us, the “Initial 2024 Guarantors”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”). On May 3, 2019, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the “First Supplemental Indenture”) to increase the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred under Credit Facilities (as defined in the 2024 Indenture) by GIH or its subsidiaries that are 2024 Guarantors (as defined below) by $ 20 million in aggregate principal amount. On March 6, 2020, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors, Gogo Air International GmbH (an indirect subsidiary of GIH) (“Gogo International”) and the Trustee entered into a second supplemental indenture (the “Second Supplemental Indenture”) to add Gogo International as a guarantor under the 2024 Indenture. On July 31, 2020, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors, Gogo International and Gogo Inflight Internet Canada Ltd., Gogo ATG LLC and Gogo CA Licenses LLC (collectively, the “Additional Guarantors” and, together with the Initial 2024 Guarantors and Gogo International, the “2024 Guarantors”) and the Trustee entered into a third supplemental indenture (the “Third Supplemental Indenture”) to add the Additional Guarantors as guarantors under the 2024 Indenture. On November 9, 2020, the Company, the Issuers, the 2024 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into a fourth supplemental indenture (together with the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture, the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture, the “2024 Indenture”) to increase the amount of indebtedness under the Credit Facilities (as defined in the Base Indenture) that may be incurred by the Issuers or the Subsidiary Guarantors (as defined in the Base Indenture) by $ 50 million in aggregate principal amount. On May 7, 2019, the Issuers issued an additional $ 20 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875 % senior secured notes due 2024 (the “2019 Additional Notes”). On November 13, 2020, the Issuers issued an additional $ 50 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Notes (the “2020 Additional Notes” and, together with the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes, the “2024 Senior Secured Notes”). The 2024 Senior Secured Notes were offered and sole in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The Initial Notes were issued at a price equal to 99.512 % of their face value, the 2019 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 100.5 % of their face value, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $ 920.7 million and the 2020 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 103.5 % of their face value, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $ 51.8 million. Additionally, we received approximately $ 0.1 million for interest that accrued from April 25, 2019 through May 7, 2019 with respect to the 2019 Additional Notes that was included in our interest payment on November 1, 2019. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Gogo Inc. and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Gogo Finance), subject to certain exceptions. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees are secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined below) and by first-priority liens on the Cash Flow Priority Collateral (as defined below), including pledged equity interests of the Issuers and all of GIH’s existing and future restricted subsidiaries guaranteeing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, except for certain excluded assets and subject to permitted liens. Upon the closing of the Transaction, certain subsidiaries were released from their guarantees under the 2024 Indenture, and certain of the ABL Priority Collateral and Cash Flow Priority Collateral were released. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $ 975 million and $ 925 million, respectively, the unaccreted debt discount was $ 1.5 million and $ 3.9 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount was $ 973.5 million and $ 921.1 million, respectively. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Initial Notes and the 2019 Additional Notes to fund the redemption of all the outstanding 2022 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and to repurchase $ 159 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined below). The 2024 Senior Secured Notes will mature on May 1, 2024 . The 2024 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.875 % per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2019. 94 We paid approximately $ 22.6 million of origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs. The deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet are being amortized over the contractual term of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $ 3.7 million and $ 2.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $ 16.6 million and $ 19.7 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 10, “Interest Costs,” for additional information. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are the senior secured indebtedness of the Issuers and are: • effectively senior to (i) all of the Issuers’ existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) the Issuers’ indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility (as defined below) to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral; • effectively equal in right of payment with the Issuers’ existing and future (i) unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes; • structurally senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, including our 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes (each as defined below); • senior in right of payment to any and all of the Issuers’ future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes; • structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantors (other than the Issuers); and • effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness secured on a senior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of ABL Priority Collateral. Each guarantee is a senior secured obligation of such 2024 Guarantor and is: • effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future (i) senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the guarantee, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral; • effectively equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing such guarantee; • effectively subordinated to the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility of each 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such 2024 Guarantor; • effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness, if any, of such 2024 Guarantor; and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantor subsidiary. The security interests in certain collateral may be released without the consent of holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes if such collateral is disposed of in a transaction that complies with the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements, and if any grantor of such security interests is released from its obligations with respect to the 95 2024 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements. Under certain circumstances, GIH and the 2024 Guarantors have the right to transfer certain intellectual property assets that on the Issue Date constitute collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the guarantees to a restricted subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland, resulting in the release of such collateral. In addition, the 2024 Indenture permits indebtedness incurred under the ABL Credit Facility to be secured on a first-priority basis by certain of the same collateral that secures the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. The Issuers may redeem the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus the make-whole premium set forth in the 2024 Indenture as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption date. On or after May 1, 2021, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes will be redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record date on or prior to the redemption date to receive interest due on an interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period commencing on May 1 of the following years: Redemption Year Price 2021 104.938 % 2022 102.469 % 2023 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, the Issuers may redeem up to 40 % of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 109.875 % of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of redemption; provided, however , that 2024 Senior Secured Notes representing at least 50 % of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption. The 2024 Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers and the 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors and, in certain circumstances, our ability, to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of GIH’s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers or make other intercompany transfers; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain transactions with the Issuers’ affiliates. The 2024 Indenture also provides that if we complete certain sales or transfers of assets, we are required to apply the Net Cash Proceeds (as defined in the Base Indenture) generated therefrom within 365 days to either permanently repay indebtedness, in accordance with the terms of the 2024 Indenture, or invest in property or non-current assets of a nature or type used in our, or a similar or related, business. If we do not so apply the Net Cash Proceeds from the Transaction by December 1, 2021, GIH will be required to make an offer to repurchase for cash an aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes equal to any Net Cash Proceeds not so applied as of such date, at a repurchase price equal to 100 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. As a result, we have classified $ 341 million of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes as short-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020, representing the amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes potentially to be repurchased with the Net Cash Proceeds. Most of these covenants, including the covenant related to the application of Net Cash Proceeds from certain sales or transfers of assets, will cease to apply if, and for as long as, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes have investment grade ratings from both Moody’s Investment Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s. If we or the Issuers undergo specific types of change of control accompanied by a downgrade in the rating of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes prior to May 1, 2024, GIH is required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101 % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. The 2024 Indenture provides for events of default, which, if any of them occur, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding 2024 Senior 96 Secured Notes issued under the 2024 Indenture to be due and payable immediately. As of December 31 , 2020, no event of default had occurred. ABL Credit Facility On August 26, 2019, Gogo Inc., GIH and Gogo Finance (together GIH and Gogo Finance are referred to as the “Borrowers”) entered into a credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) among the Borrowers, the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent, which provides for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”) of up to $ 30 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. Borrowing availability under the ABL Credit Facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base collateral calculation that is based on specified percentages of the value of eligible accounts receivable (including eligible unbilled accounts receivable) and eligible credit card receivables, less certain reserves and subject to certain other adjustments as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Availability is reduced by issuance of letters of credit as well as any borrowings. As of December 31, 2020, the facility was undrawn and $ 21.9 million remained available for borrowing under the terms of the agreement that would allow for the company to meet the “payment conditions” criteria as described in our ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, the facility was undrawn. The final maturity of the ABL Credit Facility is August 26, 2022, unless the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) has not, on or prior to December 15, 2021, been repaid in full or refinanced with a new maturity date no earlier than February 26, 2023, in which case the final maturity date shall instead be December 16, 2021. Loans outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at the Borrowers’ option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50 % to 2.00 % per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50 % to 1.00 % per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio. Unused commitments under the ABL Credit Facility are subject to a per annum fee ranging from 0.25 % to 0.375 % depending on the average quarterly usage of the revolving commitments. The obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Gogo Inc. and all of its existing and future subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the “ABL Guarantors”), and such obligations and the obligations of the ABL Guarantors are secured on a (i) senior basis by a perfected security interest in all present and after-acquired inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, securities accounts, and any cash or other assets in such accounts and other related assets owned by each ABL Guarantor and the proceeds of the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions (the “ABL Priority Collateral”) and (ii) junior basis by a perfected security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets owned by each ABL Guarantor (the “Cash Flow Priority Collateral”). The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things: the incurrence of additional indebtedness; the incurrence of additional liens; dividends or other distributions on equity; the purchase, redemption or retirement of capital stock; the payment or redemption of certain indebtedness; loans, guarantees and other investments; entering into other agreements that create restrictions on the ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on equity, make or repay certain loans, create or incur certain liens or guarantee certain indebtedness; asset sales; sale-leaseback transactions; swap agreements; consolidations or mergers; amendment of certain material documents; certain regulatory matters; Canadian pension plans; and affiliate transactions. The negative covenants are subject to customary exceptions and also permit dividends and other distributions on equity, investments, permitted acquisitions and payments or redemptions of indebtedness upon satisfaction of the “payment conditions.” The payment conditions are deemed satisfied upon Specified Availability (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) on the date of the designated action and Specified Availability for the prior 30-day period exceeding agreed-upon thresholds, the absence of the occurrence and continuance of any default and, in certain cases, pro forma compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.10 to 1.00 . 97 The ABL Credit Agreement includes a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of no less than 1.00 to 1.00, which is tested only when Specified Availability is less than the greater of (A) $ 4.5 million and (B) 15.0 % of the then effective commitments under the ABL Credit Facility, and continuing until the first day immediately succeeding the last day of the calendar month which includes the thirtieth (30th) consecutive day on which Specified Availability is in excess of such threshold so long as no default has occurred and is continuing and certain other conditions are met. As of December 31, 2020, Specified Availability had not fallen below the amount specified and therefore the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test was not applicable. Full availability under the ABL Credit Facility may be limited by our ability to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio in future periods. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the ABL Credit Facility to be terminated. On August 26, 2019, the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors entered into an ABL collateral agreement (the “ABL Collateral Agreement”), in favor of the Administrative Agent, whereby the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors granted a security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of each Borrower and each ABL Guarantor, to secure all obligations of the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors under the ABL Credit Agreement, and U.S. Bank National Association, as cash flow collateral representative, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as ABL agent, entered into a crossing lien intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) to govern the relative priority of liens on the collateral that secures the ABL Credit Agreement and the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and certain other rights, priorities and interests. On November 30, 2020, the Issuers entered into a limited consent to the ABL Credit Agreement with the financial institutions listed on the signature pages thereof and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, pursuant to which the Lenders (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) provided consent to the consummation of the Transaction. 2022 Senior Secured Notes On June 14, 2016, the Issuers issued $ 525 million aggregate principal amount of 12.500 % senior secured notes due 2022 (the “Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes”) under an Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2016 (the “Original Indenture”), among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the “2022 Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with us, the “2022 Guarantors”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee and as Collateral Agent. On January 3, 2017, the Issuers issued $ 65 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500 % senior secured notes due 2022 (the “January 2017 Additional Notes”). The January 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 108 % of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $ 70.2 million. On September 20, 2017, the Issuers, the 2022 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Original Indenture, the “Indenture”) to modify certain covenants, as discussed below. On September 25, 2017, the Issuers issued $ 100 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500 % senior secured notes due 2022 (the “September 2017 Additional Notes”). The September 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 113 % of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $ 113.0 million. Additionally, we received approximately $ 2.9 million for interest that accrued from July 1, 2017 through September 24, 2017, which was paid in our January 2018 interest payment. We refer to the Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes, the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes collectively as the “2022 Senior Secured Notes.” On April 15, 2019, the Issuers elected to call for redemption in full all $ 690 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The redemption was conditioned, among other things, upon the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or from one or more other sources, in an amount satisfactory to the Issuers which condition was satisfied by the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. On April 25, 2019, the Issuers irrevocably deposited, or caused to be irrevocably deposited, with the Trustee funds solely for the benefit of the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, cash in an amount sufficient to pay principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the 2022 Senior Secured Notes to, but not including, the date of redemption and all other sums payable under the Indenture. The Trustee executed and delivered an acknowledgement of satisfaction, discharge and 98 release, dated as of April 25, 2019, among other documents, with respect to the satisfaction and discharge of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. On May 15, 2019, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes were fully redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and the amount deposited with the Trustee on April 25, 2019 was paid to the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $ 51.4 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $ 9.1 million and the remaining debt premium of $ 11.7 million relating to the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in connection with the redemption thereof, which together are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31 , 2019. We paid approximately $ 15.9 million of aggregate origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes which were accounted for as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we paid approximately $ 1.4 million of consent fees in connection with the Supplemental Indenture, which partially offset the net carrying value of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. Total amortization expense was $ 0.9 million and $ 2.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs were written off as of May 15, 2019. 2022 Convertible Notes On November 21, 2018, we issued $ 215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes”) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $ 32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $ 22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $ 237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances described below. Upon maturity, we have the option to settle our obligation through cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2019. The $ 237.8 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $ 188.7 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $ 49.1 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, we must settle the 2022 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2022 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 8, “Interest Costs,” for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 13.6 %. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding principal on the 2022 Convertible Notes was $ 237.8 million, the unaccreted debt discount was $ 22.7 million and $ 35.9 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $ 215.1 million and $ 201.9 million, respectively. We incurred approximately $ 8.1 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, of which $ 6.4 million and $ 1.7 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The $6.4 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $ 1.8 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of unamortized 99 deferred financing costs related to the 2022 Convertible Notes was $ 2.7 million and $ 4.5 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets . See Note 8 , “Interest Costs,” for additional information. The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 common shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 6.00 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we currently expect to settle in shares for the amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes then outstanding. We may elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Holders may convert the 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $ 1,000 principal amount at any time prior to January 15, 2022, but only in the following circumstances: • during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day (the “Stock Price Condition”); • during the five-business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2022 Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2022 Convertible Notes on each such trading day (the “Notes Price Condition”); or • upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The Stock Price Condition was triggered for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2022 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after January 15, 2022 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2022. In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2022 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. 2020 Convertible Notes On March 3, 2015, we issued $ 340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the “2020 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $ 60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $ 21.9 million was subsequently exercised during March 2015, resulting in a total issuance of $ 361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes. We paid interest on the 2020 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest payments began on September 1, 2015. In November 2018, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we repurchased $ 199.9 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes at par value. As a result of the repurchase, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $ 17.9 million to face value and included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. On April 18, 2019, we commenced a cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase any and all of the outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for an amount equal to $ 1,000 per $ 1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date on the 2020 Convertible Notes 100 to, but not including, the date of payment for the 2020 Convertible Notes accepted in the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer expired on May 15, 2019, resulting in the purchase of $ 159.0 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. As a result of the Tender Offer, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $ 8.5 million to face value and unamortized deferred financing costs of $ 0.6 million were expensed. These two items are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. During September 2019, we purchased an additional $ 0.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes matured on March 1, 2020. The $ 361.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $ 261.9 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $ 100.0 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes. If we or the holders of 2020 Convertible Notes elected not to settle the debt through conversion, we were required to settle the 2020 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component was accreted up to the face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes, which resulted in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 8, “Interest Costs,” for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2020 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 11.5 %. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal on the 2020 Convertible Notes was $ 2.5 million, the unamortized debt discount was zero, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $ 2.5 million. We incurred approximately $ 10.4 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, of which $ 7.5 million and $ 2.9 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The $ 7.5 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2020 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was zero , $ 0.2 million and $ 1.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2020 Convertible Notes was zero. See Note 10, “Interest Costs,” for additional information. The 2020 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 41.9274 common shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 23.85 per share of our common stock. We had the option to elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Forward Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we paid approximately $ 140 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the “Forward Transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “Forward Counterparties”), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to one of the Forward Transactions (the “Amended and Restated Forward Transaction”) to extend the expected settlement date with respect to approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock held by one of the Forward Counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the “2022 Forward Counterparty”), to correspond with the May 15, 2022 maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. In the future, we may request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the 2022 Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the 101 2022 Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The 2022 Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the 2022 Forward Counterparty on such terms as may be mutually agreed upon at the time. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders’ equity within our consolidated balance sheet was reduced by approximately $ 140 million. Between March 5 -6 , 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. The approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transactions are treated as retired shares for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding. Restricted Cash Our restricted cash balances were $ 0.5 million and $ 7.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The balance as of December 31, 2020 consisted of a letter of credit issued for the benefit of the landlord of our current office location in Broomfield, CO. The balance as of December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of letters of credit for office locations in Broomfield, CO, Chicago, IL and Bensenville, IL as well as cash restricted to repay the remaining balance of the 2020 Convertible Notes which matured in March 2020. 10. Interest Costs The following is a summary of our interest costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands) : For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Interest costs charged to expense $ 105,988 $ 110,502 $ 100,085 Amortization of deferred financing costs 5,892 5,260 4,280 Accretion of debt discount 13,907 15,729 21,105 Amortization of debt premium - ( 1,018 ) ( 2,850 ) Interest expense 125,787 130,473 122,620 Interest costs capitalized to property and equipment - 11 32 Interest costs capitalized to software 885 608 364 Total interest costs $ 126,672 $ 131,092 $ 123,016 We capitalize a portion of our interest on funds borrowed during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and amortized over the useful lives of the assets. 11. Common Stock and Preferred Stock Common Stock – We have one class of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our common stock is junior to our preferred stock, if and when issued. Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes a total of 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $ 0.0001 per share. Preferred Stock – Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 100,000,000 shares of new preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.01 per share. No shares of this new preferred stock have been issued. The preferred stock may be issued, from time to time, in one or more series as authorized by the Board of Directors, which has the authority to designate the terms of any series of preferred stock issued, including, without limitation, the number of shares to be included in such series of preferred stock, any dividend, redemption, 102 conversion rights or voting powers and the designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights. Shareholder Rights Plan – On September 23, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”), between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, outstanding on the record date of October 2, 2020, to the stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Preferred Shares”) at a price of $ 38.40 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right, subject to adjustment. The purpose of the Rights Agreement is to facilitate the Company’s ability to preserve its net operating losses (“NOLs”) and certain other tax attributes in order to be able to offset potential future income taxes for federal income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOLs and other tax attributes would be substantially limited if it experiences an “ownership change,” as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). A company generally experiences an ownership change if the percentage of the value of its stock owned by certain “5-percent shareholders,” as such term is defined in Section 382 of the Code, increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. The Rights Agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code by deterring any person or group from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the shares of the Company’s common stock then-outstanding. Initially, the Rights will be attached to all shares of the Company’s common stock. Until the Distribution Date (as defined below), the Rights will be transferred with and only with the common stock. As long as the Rights are attached to the common stock, the Company will issue one Right with each new share of common stock so that all such shares of common stock will have Rights attached (subject to certain limited exceptions). The Rights will separate and begin trading separately from the common stock, and Right certificates will be caused to evidence the Rights, on the earlier to occur of (i) the close of business on the tenth day following public disclosure of facts indicating that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the outstanding common stock (an “Acquiring Person”) (or, in the event the Board of Directors determines to effect an exchange in accordance with Section 24 of the Rights Agreement and the Board of Directors determines that a later date is advisable, then such later date) and (ii) the close of business on the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 4.9% or more of the outstanding common stock (the earlier of such dates, the “Distribution Date”). The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on the earliest to occur of (i) the close of business on the day following the certification of the voting results of the Company’s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, if at such stockholder meeting or any other meeting of stockholders of the Company duly held prior to such meeting, a proposal to ratify the Rights Agreement has not been passed by the requisite vote of the Company’s stockholders, (ii) the date on which the Board of Directors determines in its sole discretion that (x) the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of material valuable NOLs or tax attributes or (y) the NOLs and tax attributes have been fully utilized and may no longer be carried forward and (iii) the close of business on September 23, 2023. 103 12. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: • Level 1 - defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2 - defined as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and • Level 3 - defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. Long-Term Debt: Our financial assets and liabilities that are disclosed but not measured at fair value include the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes, and, while outstanding, the 2020 Convertible Notes, which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet at cost. The fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since they are based on quoted market prices of our instruments in markets that are not active. We estimated the fair value of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes, and, while outstanding, the 2020 Convertible Notes by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume these obligations. The upfront cash payments used in the calculations of fair value on our December 31, 2020 consolidated balance sheet, excluding any issuance costs, are the amount that a market participant would be willing to lend at December 31, 2020 to an entity with a credit rating similar to ours and that would allow such an entity to achieve sufficient cash inflows to cover the scheduled cash outflows under the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes, and, while outstanding, the 2020 Convertible Notes. The calculated fair value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, and, while outstanding, the 2020 Convertible Notes is correlated to our stock price and as a result, significant changes to our stock price could have a significant impact on their calculated fair values. The fair value and carrying value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in thousands) : December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Fair Value (1) Carrying Value Fair Value (1) Carrying Value 2024 Senior Secured Notes $ 1,045,000 $ 973,539 (2) $ 982,000 $ 921,137 (2) 2022 Convertible Notes $ 404,000 $ 215,122 ( 3 ) $ 297,000 $ 201,868 ( 3 ) 2020 Convertible Notes $ - $ - $ 2,498 $ 2,498 (1) Fair value amounts are rounded to the nearest million, except for the 2020 Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2019. (2) Carrying value of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes reflects the unaccreted debt discount of $ 1.5 million and $ 3.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” for further information. (3) Carrying value of the 2022 Convertible Notes reflects the unaccreted debt discount of $ 22.6 million and $ 35.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 9, “Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities,” for further information. 1 3 . Business Segments and Major Customers Business Segments – Prior to the closing of the Transaction, we historically reported our results of operations in three segments: Commercial Aviation-North America (“CA-NA”), Commercial Aviation-Rest of World (“CA-ROW”) and Business Aviation. We managed and reported these businesses separately, as they generally did not share the same customer base, had different products, pricing and expense structures, and measured operating 104 performance and allocated resources on different bases. As a result of the Transaction, we operate in a single distinct business segment, B usiness A viation, for which operating performance is measured and resources are allocated on a consolidated basis, consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, our CEO. Therefore, we now report one business segment, comprised of our continuing operations. Our revenue from customers domiciled outside of the United States accounted for less than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our assets outside of the United States as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were immaterial. Major Customers – With respect to continuing operations, no customer accounted for more than 10 % of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 or more than 5 % of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. 14. Stock-Based Compensation As of December 31, 2020, we maintained three stock-based incentive compensation plans: the Gogo Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2016 Omnibus Plan”), the Gogo Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2013 Omnibus Plan”), and The Aircell Holdings Inc. Stock Option Plan, collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans,” as well as an ESPP, as defined and discussed below. Our Stock Plans provide for the grant of both equity and cash awards, including non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards (shares and units), restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), deferred share units (“DSUs”) and other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents to eligible employees, directors and consultants, as determined by the Compensation Committee. Under the Stock Plans, 27,709,128 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. As of December 31, 2020, 6,923,988 shares remained available for grant under our Stock Plans. The contractual life of granted options is 10 years. Except as otherwise approved by the Compensation Committee, all options that are unvested as of the date on which a recipient’s employment terminates, as well as vested options that are not exercised within a prescribed period following termination, are forfeited and become available for future grants. Options granted beginning in 2010 but prior to the Option Exchange (as defined below) include options that (a) vest in specified increments over a four-year period, (b) vest on the date of grant for certain options granted to non-employee members of our board of directors or (c) vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant for certain options granted to non-employee members of our board of directors. In June 2020, we consummated an option exchange program that was approved by our stockholders at the annual meeting held on April 29, 2020 in which previously outstanding eligible options (which excluded options granted for service by non-executive members of our board of directors) to purchase 6,664,773 shares of common stock were surrendered and cancelled and we granted replacement options (the “Replacement Options”) in exchange for the tendered options. Of the 4,168,455 options we granted in 2020, 2,896,383 were Replacement Options. The Replacement Options vest in a single installment on December 31, 2022. Beginning in 2013, we granted RSUs, some of which vest in equal annual increments over a four-year period and others in one installment on December 31, 2022. Vested RSUs will be settled, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, in shares of our common stock or in cash equal to the value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock on the vesting date. We also granted DSUs to directors, some of which vest on the grant date and others on the first anniversary of the grant date. DSUs will be settled in shares of our common stock 90 days after the director ceases to serve as a director. Beginning in 2014, we granted restricted stock, which vests in equal annual increments over a four-year period. These shares are deemed issued as of the date of grant, but not outstanding until they vest. We intend to settle RSU, DSU and restricted stock awards in stock and we have the shares available to do so. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the Compensation Committee approved grants of both non-market-based awards that time vested as described above, and market-based awards. The market-based awards vested based on achieving one or more predetermined market conditions and completion of the same time-based vesting requirements applicable to the non-market-based awards. In 2020, the market-based awards granted in 2016 expired without the market-based condition having been achieved and the Compensation Committee approved removing the market-based vesting conditions in the awards granted in 2017, 2018 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, there are no awards that contain market-based conditions. 105 In August 2020, we communicated to employees that the 2020 annual bonus, which historically has been paid in cash, wa s expected to be paid in shares of Gogo common stock , with t he bonus payment amount to be determined based upon our performance against established goals . A s a result, stock-based compensation expense corresponding to the value of the shares of Gogo common stock expected to be distributed was to be recorded through the expected grant date in March 2021, and a pro rata amount was re cognized through September 30, 2020 . The Compensation Committee reserve d the discretion to change the method of payment of this bonus from stock to c ash , which it did in the fourth quarter of 2020 following the closing of the Transaction . As a result, the stock - based compensation expense related to this bonus pla n was reversed and the amount of the expected cash bonus payout was recorded as a charge to expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 . The following is a summary of our stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations , excluding the stock-based compensation expense for discontinued operations , for the years December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 (in thousands) : 2020 2019 2018 Cost of service revenue $ 119 $ 118 $ - Cost of equipment revenue 235 275 210 Engineering, design and development 560 601 721 Sales and marketing 880 1,233 1,754 General and administrative 6,014 6,427 5,851 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 7,808 $ 8,654 $ 8,536 A summary of stock option activity (which includes amounts for both continuing and discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows: Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Options outstanding – January 1, 2020 11,074,504 $ 11.70 5.25 $ – Granted 1,272,072 $ 2. 54 Issued in option exchange 2,896,383 $ 2.61 Exercised ( 87,104 ) $ 3.00 Forfeited ( 6,779,837 ) $ 12.12 Expired ( 2,929,350 ) $ 12.00 Options outstanding – December 31, 2020 5,446,668 $ 4.19 7.33 $ 32,458 Options exercisable – December 31, 2020 1,876,337 $ 7.01 5.59 $ 7,739 As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options were approximately $ 5 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.8 years. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $ 16 million, $ 8 million and $ 9 million, respectively. 106 We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Weighted average assumptions used and weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Approximate risk-free interest rate 0.5 % 2.3 % 2.7 % Average expected life (years) 6.20 6.02 6.03 Dividend yield N/A N/A N/A Volatility 66.8 % 60.5 % 49.2 % Weighted average grant date fair value of common stock underlying options granted $ 2.59 $ 4.71 $ 8.97 Weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted $ 1.56 $ 2.69 $ 4.42 The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the term that mirrored the expected term in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of our stock options was determined based upon a simplified assumption that the stock options will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life. The dividend yield was based on expected dividends at the time of grant. Beginning in 2020, we calculated volatility based exclusively on our own common stock. The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs and DSUs (which includes amounts for both continuing and discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2020: Number of Underlying Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested – January 1, 2020 4,183,232 $ 5.18 Granted 3,050,865 $ 2.24 Vested ( 3,160,611 ) $ 4.09 Forfeited/canceled ( 625,317 ) $ 3.89 Unvested – December 31, 2020 3,448,169 $ 3.80 As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $ 5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years. The total grant date fair value of RSUs and DSUs vested in 2020 was approximately $ 14 million. The following table summarizes the activity for our restricted stock (which includes amounts for both continuing and discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2020: Number of Underlying Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Unvested – January 1, 2020 44,204 $ 11.63 Granted – $ – Vested ( 25,977 ) $ 11.19 Forfeited/canceled – $ – Unvested – December 31, 2020 18,227 $ 12.26 As of December 31, 2020, there was less than $ 0.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee restricted stock. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 0.3 years. 107 ESPP - In June 2013, the Board of Directors and stockholders approved the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which became effective on June 26, 2013, and in 2017 and 2020, the ESPP was amended to increase the number of shares reserved thereunder. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of common stock during pre-specified offering periods at a discount established by the Compensation Committee which may not exceed 15 % of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period (whichever is lower). Under the ESPP, 2,200,000 shares were reserved for issuance and 363,209 shares of common stock were issued during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, 815,140 shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP. 15. Employee Retirement and Postretirement Benefits 401(k) Plan - Under our 401(k) plan, all employees who are eligible to participate are entitled to make tax-deferred contributions, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. We match 100 % of the employee’s first 4 % of contributions made, subject to annual limitations. Our matching contributions were $ 1.5 million, $ 1.3 million, and $ 1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 16. Income Tax For financial reporting purposes, the loss from continuing operations before income taxes included the following components for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 United States $ ( 45,840 ) $ ( 85,806 ) $ ( 54,655 ) Foreign ( 2,865 ) ( 2,128 ) ( 1,159 ) Loss before income taxes $ ( 48,705 ) $ ( 87,934 ) $ ( 55,814 ) Significant components of the (benefit) provision for income taxes for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are as follows ( in thousands ): For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Current: Federal $ - $ - $ - State 86 385 467 Foreign - - - 86 385 467 Deferred: Federal ( 318 ) 91 ( 3,908 ) State 86 87 87 ( 232 ) 178 ( 3,821 ) Total $ ( 146 ) $ 563 $ ( 3,354 ) 108 The (benefit) provision for income taxes for continuing operations differs from income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 as a result of the following items: For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Effect of: Impact of change in tax rate - ( 0.1 ) 0.3 Change in valuation allowance ( 48.9 ) ( 25.1 ) ( 28.9 ) State income taxes-net of federal tax benefit 14.0 6.9 11.9 Other 14.2 ( 3.1 ) 1.7 Effective tax rate 0.3 % ( 0.6 )% 6.0 % Components of the net deferred income tax asset as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows ( in thousands ): December 31, December 31, 2020 2019 Deferred income tax assets: Compensation accruals $ 7,618 $ 5,847 Stock options 23,263 18,192 Inventory 1,784 1,266 Warranty reserves 599 913 Capital loss 17,712 - Deferred rent - - Deferred revenue 315 43,256 Federal net operating loss (NOL) 154,180 130,878 State NOL 25,896 24,744 Interest carryforward 66,379 48,980 UNICAP adjustment 1,733 2,539 Finite-lived intangible assets 4,748 6,394 Lease liability 11,539 22,355 Other 7,671 9,243 Total deferred income tax assets 323,437 314,607 Deferred income tax liabilities: Fixed assets ( 8,673 ) ( 59,584 ) Indefinite-lived intangible assets ( 7,619 ) ( 7,074 ) Convertible Notes discount ( 5,512 ) ( 8,706 ) Right-of-use asset ( 8,435 ) ( 13,553 ) Other ( 1,924 ) ( 3,768 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities ( 32,163 ) ( 92,685 ) Total deferred income tax 291,274 221,922 Valuation allowance ( 293,382 ) ( 224,262 ) Net deferred income tax liability $ ( 2,108 ) $ ( 2,340 ) We assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized through the generation of future taxable income. We generated net losses in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, which means we are in a domestic three-year cumulative loss position. As a result of this and other assessments in fiscal year 2020, we concluded that a full valuation allowance is required for all deferred tax assets and liabilities except for deferred tax liabilities associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. 109 As of December 31, 2020, the federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward amount was approximately $ 647 million and the state NOL carryforward amount was approximately $ 452 million. The federal NOLs begin to expire in 2031. The state NOLs expire in various tax years and began to expire in 2016. Utilization of our NOL, interest carryforward and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The interest carryforward arises from U.S. Tax Reform and generally limits the interest expense deduction to 30 % of EBITDA for tax years 2018 to 2021 and 30 % of EBIT for 2022 and subsequent years. The interest carryforward will not expire as it may be carried forward indefinitely. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50 % over a three-year period. We are subject to taxation in the United States and Canada. With few exceptions, as of December 31, 2020, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2017. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did no t have any unrecognized tax benefits. We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision line item in the consolidated statement of operations. No penalties or interest related to uncertain tax positions were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did no t have a liability recorded for interest or potential penalties. We do no t expect a change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. 17. Leases The following is a summary of our lease expense included in the consolidated statement of operations (in thousands) : For the Year Ended For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 11,688 $ 11,676 Finance lease cost: Amortization of leased assets 230 665 Interest on lease liabilities 113 56 Total lease cost $ 12,031 $ 12,397 110 Other information regarding our leases is as follows (in thousands, except lease terms and discount rates) : For the Year Ended For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Supplemental cash flow information Cash paid for amounts included in measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows used in operating leases $ 12,733 $ 13,059 Operating cash flows used in finance leases $ 113 $ 56 Financing cash flows used in finance leases $ 546 $ - Non-cash items: Operating leases obtained $ 5,342 $ 4,197 Finance leases obtained $ 428 $ 1,268 Weighted average remaining lease term Operating leases 7 years 8 years Finance leases 2 years 3 years Weighted average discount rate Operating leases 11.2 % 10.3 % Finance leases 10.5 % 8.3 % Annual future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands) : Years ending December 31, Operating Leases Financing Leases 2021 $ 12,521 $ 925 2022 11,800 846 2023 7,904 262 2024 6,078 - 2025 4,685 - Thereafter 25,157 - Total future minimum lease payments 68,145 2,033 Less: Amount representing interest ( 22,038 ) ( 144 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments $ 46,107 $ 1,889 Reported as of December 31, 2020 Accrued liabilities $ 8,089 $ 719 Non-current operating lease liabilities 38,018 - Other non-current liabilities - 1,170 Total lease liabilities $ 46,107 $ 1,889 As of December 31, 2020, there were no significant leases which had not yet commenced. 18. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Commitments - We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase satellite-based systems, certifications and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the equipment or certifications, or as development services are provided. Indemnifications and Guarantees - In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this 111 indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of the performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. Linksmart Litigation - On April 20, 2018 , Linksmart Wireless Technology, LLC filed suit against Gogo Inc., Gogo LLC, our former subsidiary and the entity that operated our CA business (“Gogo LLC”), and eight CA airline partners in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that CA’s redirection server and login portal infringe a patent owned by the plaintiff. The suits seek an unspecified amount of damages. Intelsat is required under its contracts with these airlines, which it assumed in the Transaction, to indemnify them for defense costs and any liabilities resulting from the suit. The Court has stayed the suits against the airline customers pending resolution of the suit against Gogo. Linksmart has also filed suit against other defendants asserting the same patent. Following the filing by one of those defendants of a petition to commence an inter partes review against the asserted patent in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Court stayed the litigation against such other defendant, Gogo Inc. and Gogo LLC, but such stay was lifted in July 2019 when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the petitioner had not met the standard of proof required to commence the inter partes review. Since the stay was lifted, discovery has been completed and motion practice continues. No date has been set for trial. We believe that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. The outcome of this litigation is inherently uncertain. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Securities Litigation - On June 27, 2018 , a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division styled Pierrelouis v. Gogo Inc., naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, its current Chief Financial Officer and its then-current President, Commercial Aviation as defendants purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our securities from February 27, 2017 through May 4, 2018. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, alleging misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to the reliability of and installation and remediation costs associated with CA’s 2Ku antenna. The plaintiffs seek to recover from us and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages. In December 2018 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and in February 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss such amended complaint. In October 2019 the judge granted the motion to dismiss on two independent grounds, finding that plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that defendants made materially false or misleading statements and that plaintiffs failed to plead with particularity that defendants acted with scienter. The amended complaint was dismissed without prejudice, and in December 2019, defendants filed a second amended complaint. In July 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting leave to file a proposed third amendment complaint, which was granted by the Court. Plaintiffs proceeded to file the third amended complaint in July 2020 and we filed a motion to dismiss in September 2020. That motion has been fully briefed and we await the Court’s ruling. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. In accordance with Delaware law, we will indemnify the individual named defendants for their defense costs and any damages they incur in connection with the suit. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy with respect to this suit. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Derivative Litigation - On September 25, 2018 and September 26, 2018 , two purported stockholders of the Company filed substantively identical derivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, styled Nanduri v. Gogo Inc. and Hutsenpiller v. Gogo Inc., respectively. Both lawsuits were purportedly brought derivatively on behalf of us and name us as a nominal defendant and name as 112 defendants each member of the Company’s Board of Directors, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and allege misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to the 2Ku antenna’s reliability and installation and remediation costs, as well as allegedly excessive bonuses, stock options, and other compensation paid to current Officers and Directors and excessive severance paid to former Officers. The two lawsuits were consolidated and are stayed until a final disposition of the motion to dismiss in the class action suit . We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously if the litigation resumes. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on our behalf, an unspecified amount of damages from the individual defendants. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors’ and Officers’ insurance policy with respect to these suits. No amounts have been accrued for any potential costs under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential costs. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material adverse impact on our company due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted, which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as damages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs.

Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2020 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020. (b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Gogo Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a – 15(f) and 15d – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Gogo’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The management of Gogo, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have assessed the effectiveness of Gogo’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, the Company’s management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, which report is included on Page 118 of this Form 10-K under the caption entitled “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no material changes to our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information None. 117 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Gogo Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Gogo Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated March 11, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Chicago, Illinois March 11, 2021 118 Part III Item 10.

Business Who We Are Gogo is the in-flight Internet company. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every device on every flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated satellite and air-to-ground (ATG) networks, engineer, install and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software, and deliver customizable connectivity and wireless entertainment services and global support capabilities to our aviation partners. We are the leading global provider of in-flight broadband connectivity and wireless entertainment services, with our equipment installed and services provided on approximately 3,200 commercial aircraft and approximately 5,700 business aircraft as of December 31, 2019. Our industry is characterized by rapid technological development, and we continually invest in research and development to maintain our leading global market share and support our aviation partners needs. Since we announced our next-generation 2Ku global satellite system (2Ku) in 2014, 20 domestic and international airlines have selected 2Ku for installation, and as of December 31, 2019, our 2Ku system had been installed on more than 1,400 aircraft with approximately 900 additional 2Ku aircraft in our backlog (as defined below under the heading Contracts with Airline Partners). Of the aircraft installed with 2Ku as of December 31, 2019, approximately 540 were upgrades from previously installed Gogo systems. The 2Ku system is capable of delivering peak speeds of 100 Mbps to the aircraft. We also continue to innovate and improve our North American terrestrial networks. In May 2019, we announced our plans to build our Gogo 5G network for use on business aviation aircraft, commercial regional 2 jets and smaller mainline jets operating within the continental United States and Canada. We expect the new network to be available in 2021. Gogo 5G will support licensed, shared and unlicensed spectrum and high, low and middle bands and will allow us to take advantage of new advances in technology as they are developed. We will continue to provide service over our 3G and 4G networks in North America to provide redundancy to the Gogo 5G network when needed. Our leading global market share supports our continued investment in ongoing research and development and the global operating capabilities required to support our aviation partners needs. Our technology roadmap includes plans for continued rapid improvement in bandwidth speeds and other performance metrics of our in-flight systems. Our Customers We have served the aviation industry for nearly 30 years and are the only provider in our industry that is focused exclusively on in-flight connectivity and entertainment. Our customers are airlines in the commercial aviation market and aircraft owners/operators in the business aviation market. We have two reporting segments in the commercial aviation market: Commercial Aviation North America (CA-NA) and Commercial Aviation Rest of World (CA-ROW) (together with CA-NA, CA) and we have one business aviation market reporting segment, Business Aviation (BA). We leverage our network solutions across the three segments and our customers benefit from our technology innovation and increased bandwidth. Through CA-NA, we offer ATG and satellite connectivity and entertainment services to commercial aircraft flying routes generally within North America, operated by Aeromexico, Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines pursuant to long-term agreements. The systems currently in operation in CA-NA include ATG and ATG-4, our first and second generation ATG networks, and 2Ku. As of December 31, 2019, CA-NA had 2,442 aircraft online, 856 of which were equipped with ATG-4, 721 with ATG, 865 with 2Ku and more than 2,200 with Gogo Vision, our in-flight video-on-demand entertainment service. Through CA-ROW, we offer satellite connectivity and entertainment services to commercial aircraft flying routes outside of North America operated by Air Canada, Air Canada Rouge, Air France, KLM, Cathay Pacific, Cathay Dragon, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, GOL, Iberia, Japan Air Lines, JTA, LATAM Airlines, LEVEL, Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Australia pursuant to long-term agreements. As of December 31, 2019, our CA-ROW segment had 792 aircraft online, 250 of which were installed with Ku, our first-generation satellite-based system, 542 with 2Ku and more than 400 with Gogo Vision. In November 2019, we announced that Qatar Airways has selected Gogo to provide 2Ku connectivity and Live TV on 70 aircraft. Through BA, we offer a broad suite of integrated equipment, network and Internet connectivity products and services to the business aviation market. Our offerings include a customizable suite of smart cabin systems for highly integrated connectivity, cabin management, in-flight entertainment and voice solutions. BAs customers include OEMs such as Pilatus, Beechcraft, Bombardier, Cessna, Dassault Falcon, Embraer, Gulfstream, and Learjet, as well as the largest fractional jet operators (including Delta Private Jets, Flexjet, Flight Options and NetJets), charter operators, corporate flight departments, and individuals. We have a global distribution network of approximately 170 independent certified dealers. As of December 31, 2019, BA had a total of 5,669 aircraft online with Gogo Biz, our ATG network in North America, of which 841 were equipped with AVANCE L5  , a unified Gogo Biz technology platform, 348 were equipped with AVANCE L3  , a compact version of AVANCE L5 modified for small business aircraft, and 851 were equipped with Gogo Vision. As of such date, BA also had 4,773 aircraft online equipped with Iridium, a lower bandwidth global satellite solution. 3 Our In-flight Internet Portfolio We focus exclusively on aviation and implement our value proposition of offering the best products and services through a comprehensive portfolio consisting of our in-flight network, in-flight systems, in-flight services, and aviation partner support. In-flight Network . Our network solutions are engineered to provide industry-leading cost, capacity, coverage, reliability and aero-performance. We offer aviation partners a variety of network solutions suitable for operation on most of the worlds commercial and business aircraft. We market our global satellite network solutions to approximately 21,000 commercial aircraft. Our terrestrial network targets approximately 1,800 commercial regional jets and approximately 23,500 business aircraft. Approximately two-thirds of all business aircraft and regional commercial aircraft currently in operation are based in North America. Such aircraft generally fly over land and are well-suited for our ATG solutions given their smaller antenna, lighter weight and reduced equipment and operating costs (including fuel). Global Satellite Network : We operate a global Ku-band satellite network comprised of 34 satellites operated by SES, Intelsat and other providers and 18 leased teleports operated by Gogo. Our 2Ku and Ku in-flight systems both operate on this network. The capacity, speed, coverage and reliability of this network are continually improved by incorporating new satellites, including high throughput satellites (HTS). We also anticipate incorporating new satellite technologies that have yet to come online, such as low-earth orbit (LEO) and mid-earth orbit (MEO) satellites. North American Terrestrial Network : We operate a terrestrial network using 3 MHz of licensed spectrum in the 800 MHz band and approximately 260 terrestrial cell sites in the lower 48 states and parts of Alaska and Canada. As of December 31, 2019, this network supported 3.1 Mbps ATG service and 9.8 Mbps ATG-4 service to CA and BA aircraft. In May 2019, we announced that we are building our Gogo 5G network, which we expect to be available in 2021. Ground Network : We lease an extensive, predominantly fiber-optic network to connect our approximately 260 cell sites and 18 teleports to our two data centers, the Internet and cloud-based services, and our network operations center (NOC). Our data centers and cloud-based services provide redundant telecommunications connections to the Internet and contain numerous servers that enable the expansive set of features offered through the Gogo platform. The NOC monitors daily network operations, conducts network diagnostics and coordinates responses to any performance issues on the ground or in the air. We augment our ability to monitor, maintain and update our in-flight systems while aircraft are on the ground with a terrestrial modem utilizing 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi wireless service. In-flight Systems . To utilize our in-flight network and provide our in-flight services, we have developed proprietary systems of airborne equipment and software. Our in-flight systems are designed for superior performance, future adaptability and ease of certification, installation and maintenance. Each system consists of: (i) an antenna specifically designed for the network and technology being used to provide the service; (ii) a modular in-cabin Wi-Fi network that includes state-of-the art servers, modems and wireless access points; and (iii) system software designed to reliably support a variety of in-flight services provided by Gogo, our aviation partners and third parties. Our 2Ku system employs a modular, open architecture that is adaptable to current and future satellites of multiple types provided by multiple satellite providers, supports different modems and is upgradeable with minimum disruption to the flight schedules and operations of our aviation partners. In-flight Services . We provide a wide range of in-flight services for passengers, flight and cabin crews and operational use by our aviation partners. We leverage our increased bandwidth to expand our connectivity and entertainment services. Passenger Connectivity Services . Passengers connect to the Internet from their personal electronic devices, as they would on the ground, to access corporate and personal applications that include streaming services on our higher capacity networks. Our continued increases in bandwidth enable us to serve more passengers 4 per flight. In CA, passengers may select from a variety of pricing options tailored to devices, routes, available bandwidth and session durations, in addition to monthly and annual subscriptions. In BA, we offer a variety of connectivity services tailored to our various networks and technologies that are generally priced per aircraft per month. Passenger connectivity services are and will continue to be a significant source of our revenue. Passenger Entertainment Services . Through Gogo Vision, our video-on-demand product accessible from passengers personal electronic devices, commercial and business aircraft passengers can access a large library of entertainment options, which currently include on-demand movies and television shows. Through Gogo TV, we deliver live television content to passengers on satellite-equipped flights using our in-cabin network. As of December 31, 2019, Gogo Vision was available on more than 2,600 aircraft and Gogo TV was available on more than 850 aircraft. In addition, in 2019, we began commercial service of Gogo Vision Touch, a new wireless seatback product that enables passengers to stream entertainment and other content to a tablet mounted on the seatback. As of December 31, 2019, Gogo Vision Touch was available on 28 aircraft. Connected Aircraft Services . Using our Connected Aircraft Services (CAS), our aviation partners can access connectivity-based, data-oriented applications designed to improve the flying experience and enhance the operational efficiency of our airline partners by leveraging the connectivity we provide to the aircraft. CAS provides value by capturing key data from aircraft sensors, databases and crew inputs and combining it with data coming from the ground to provide comprehensive and real-time visibility into operations. For example, CAS currently supports route optimization, turbulence avoidance, electronic flight bag (EFB) applications, real-time credit card processing and weather data. In 2019, BA partnered with ForeFlight to bring new GPS location information and altitude to the ForeFlight Mobile iOS-based application for business aviation. Using the onboard Gogo AVANCE system or ATG 4000/5000, ForeFlight Mobile can deliver flight location information throughout the cockpit and cabin using the onboard Wi-Fi signal, information typically provided via a separate GPS system requiring additional onboard hardware and antennas. We are also working with our airline partners to develop solutions that enable class-of-service based entitlements to passengers. Aviation Partner Support . Account Team . Each CA airline has a dedicated Gogo account team that provides assistance during the certification and installation process and throughout the term of our partnership. BA has a customer operations team that assists our dealers with installation, troubleshooting and system activations, and its flight department is supported by field service engineering teams located at key locations across the United States and Europe. Both the dealer network and flight department have access to our technical and logistical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Operational Support . We provide a variety of services required to install and maintain our in-flight systems. In CA, our experienced technical engineers do the engineering work necessary to certify and install our equipment on commercial aircraft of all major models and work with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and international regulators to obtain Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) and other required approvals. Our installation technicians work with airline partners or third parties to assist in installation, which can be completed overnight for our terrestrial network systems and in less than 48 hours for our satellite systems. In our BA business, we support the certification and installation functions of our customers. Supply chain organizations in CA and BA receive, inspect, test, warehouse, kit and ship materials. Following installation, our NOC continually monitors the network and its usage and performance. We operate a 24/7 maintenance coordination and scheduling service and perform or support maintenance for aviation partners at a variety of U.S. and international locations. Comprehensive Analytics . We have extensive databases, a big data platform and analytical capabilities to evaluate our system and operational performance. Our analytical capabilities are used by us, our aviation partners and our vendors in designing, manufacturing, and operating our systems to maximize performance and minimize disruptions and system downtime. 5 Competitive Strengths We maintain the leading global market position in connectivity for each of the CA and BA markets. We have designed our value proposition to align with our aviation partners priorities and we believe that our comprehensive product and service portfolio sets us apart from competitors by better meeting customer needs through: Leading Performance . Our networks and systems are designed to provide the best in-flight Internet experience and highest network and system availability across the broadest range of aircraft wherever they fly. We offer the broadest array of in-flight connectivity technologies in the market, including our proprietary 2Ku, Ku, ATG-4/ATG, AVANCE L5 and AVANCE L3 systems. We are the only in-flight connectivity provider to offer both ATG and satellite-based solutions and our satellite network offers the most comprehensive global coverage in our industry. The breadth of our technologies allows our customers to select the best solution based on aircraft size and route  serving everything from smaller BA aircraft to the largest widebody CA aircraft. 2Ku is capable of delivering peak speeds to the aircraft of 100 Mbps and enables end users to enjoy a ground-like experience, including streaming and other bandwidth-intensive applications. It employs two low-profile satellite antennas with higher spectral efficiency, superior equatorial performance, and lower drag and fuel burn as compared to competing satellite antennas. Continuous Innovation . We continuously innovate and have a strong track record of innovation. We pioneered and have led innovation in our industry for nearly 30 years, as evidenced by the nine network technologies, six of which are proprietary to Gogo, that we have deployed. In addition, we hold more than 250 U.S. and international patents, most of which relate to network technology. We design our solutions to provide leading performance and to last for many years, as evidenced by our 2Ku system. The 2Ku system is designed to deliver maximum satellite capacity, and its open, modular architecture enables us to obtain satellite capacity from multiple existing and anticipated satellites operated by multiple providers, thereby enabling our aviation partners to offer leading performance for many years without the need for antenna swaps or other invasive changes to the aircraft. This open architecture is facilitated by our proprietary antenna system and our investments in modem and antenna positioner hardware and software. We are currently researching and developing a fully electronic phased array antenna. The 2Ku architecture is designed to enable adoption of new technologies and new satellite constellations such as LEOs and MEOs in the future while minimizing the impact of hardware changes on aircraft. By leasing satellite capacity, we maximize our flexibility to adopt rapid innovations in satellites and to obtain capacity when, where and in the amount required by our aviation customers. We expect continued rapid innovation in satellites to yield improved global coverage and redundancy, increased capacity and peak speed, and lower latency. With approximately 80% of the commercial air traffic concentrated in less than 20% of the global airspace, our multi-provider, multi-satellite approach most efficiently matches supply with demand. We are band agnostic, and as more open Ka band capacity has become available, we have begun to offer regional Ka band satellite solutions for sale where appropriate. Our innovation also continues with our ATG networks. In May 2019, we announced that we are building our fourth ATG network  Gogo 5G, which is scheduled to be available in 2021. Gogo 5G will improve the passenger experience by providing lower latency and higher throughput than our current network through the use of both our proprietary licensed spectrum and available unlicensed spectrum. Customer-Focus . We provide a hardware and software platform that allows connectivity-enabled services to be deployed quickly, easily and flexibly across all of our networks. Gogo supports airline partners with customized portals and applications. These portals are managed by Gogo, airlines or third parties that rely on Gogos platform for many functions, including user accounts and 6 passwords, payments, entertainment and other stored content. These capabilities are common regardless of which network the aircraft operates on, enabling our airline partners to bring their customized user experiences to their full fleets. We offer various levels of customization based on our airline partners needs, ranging from a look and feel consistent with the airlines branding to fully customized portals designed to provide unique passenger experiences based on the airlines specifications. We are continually engaged in enhancing our services in order to enhance the user experience. For example, we employ sophisticated network management techniques intended to improve the user experience by ensuring that sufficient bandwidth is available for various services such as messaging, browsing and streaming. In addition, our captive portal enables us to develop system improvements that improve the user experience by streamlining the sign-on process and making it easier for users to access our IFC service. Our AVANCE system provides BA customers with a common software platform that operates across all Gogo networks and allows aviation partners to customize their passengers in-flight experiences by selecting from a variety of offerings that include various levels of connectivity; on-demand entertainment; information and applications; smart cabin customization; and real-time support and tools. The flexibility of the AVANCE system enables BA owners and operators to add or reduce system capabilities as their needs change. Additionally, both our CA and BA platforms provide hosting, reporting, data labels, storage and other capabilities for an increasing array of CAS applications from a variety of third-party partners. Long-Term Support . There are unique requirements that separate aviation from terrestrial markets and we have the necessary scale and expertise to address this market. Gogo supports the largest fleet of connected aircraft and we have acquired significant technological and operational expertise and developed long-term and robust supplier relationships in both business and commercial aviation. In commercial aviation, we have the capability to install ATG equipment overnight and satellite solutions in less than two days, and to deploy software upgrades remotely. As of December 31, 2019, we were operating or supporting 57 installation lines at 44 installation locations around the globe. Some of our airline customers perform their own installations with Gogos support. After installation, our support continues and in 2019, we provided maintenance services for customer aircraft that flew more than 4.7 million flights to or from six continents. Airlines are increasingly assuming responsibility for equipment maintenance and we are leveraging our experience to support them, including by training them in best practices. Growth Strategy The four key drivers fueling Gogos growth and financial performance are: increasing the number of Gogo-connected aircraft, growing service revenue by increasing usage of Gogos in-flight services, reducing investment per aircraft and improving margins. Increase Number of Gogo-Connected Aircraft Less than half of the global fleet of approximately 23,000 commercial aircraft and 31,300 business aircraft are currently broadband connected. We expect that nearly all of the worlds commercial aircraft and a rapidly increasing percentage of business aircraft will be broadband connected over the next decade. These new connections will increasingly occur on new aircraft through the OEM channel. Commercial Aviation . As of December 31, 2019, we provided our connectivity services on 3,234 commercial aircraft. Based on the strength of our comprehensive portfolio, we expect to continue to sign contracts with airlines to equip existing and new aircraft. Our 2Ku system has been factory line-fit on Airbus A220 and Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and we have obtained the certifications required for OEM retrofit installation on Boeing 737 MAX and 787 aircraft and Airbus A-330, A-340, A-350 and A-380 7 aircraft. In addition, 2Ku is conditionally offerable (that is, available for factory line-fit upon request by an airline but not yet in Airbuss catalog) on the A-320 family and A-330neo aircraft, and we expect to install Airbus A-321 aircraft as factory line-fit later this year. Business Aviation . As of December 31, 2019, the business aviation market was comprised of approximately 23,500 business aircraft in North America and approximately 7,700 business aircraft in the rest of the world, and we had approximately 5,700 business aircraft online with broadband connectivity, principally in North America. We increased our number of broadband business aircraft online by more than 400 in 2019. A significant number of BA aircraft are new aircraft on which our systems are installed and sold by OEMs, including Pilatus, Beechcraft, Bombardier, Cessna, Dassault Falcon, Embraer, Gulfstream, and Learjet. Since 2017, we have offered our customers AVANCE L5, an integrated and customizable in-flight system that employs our ATG-4 network in North America and is faster than our Gogo Biz solution. In 2018, we introduced AVANCE L3, a more compact integrated, customizable in-flight system that uses our ATG network and is targeted at light jets and turbo props in North America, and we announced that we are building our state-of-the-art Gogo 5G network, which we expect to be available in 2021. By leveraging networks shared with CA, we now have in-flight systems that address nearly all segments of the business aviation market. Our ability to provide CAS and our flexibility in providing various pricing options further support our strategy of targeting various segments of the market. Grow Service Revenue through Increased Usage We expect to continue to grow our service revenue by increasing the take rates for passenger connectivity and the adoption of additional services, including entertainment and CAS. Our strategies for increasing usage of our in-flight services include the following: Increase Passenger Adoption of Connectivity . We intend to leverage our existing technology and our technology roadmap to continue to enhance the passenger experience and the number and quality of available services. Our mission is to provide all passengers on every flight a ground-like experience, including video streaming. We expect to engage additional passengers through a combination of multiple tiers of service and multiple payers. In CA-ROW, we expect passenger adoption to increase, particularly on aircraft operated by airlines who recently became our partners, as their Gogo-installed fleets expand and mature. In BA, we continue to introduce a variety of broadband and voice services and related pricing plans, allowing aircraft operators and owners various options based on data usage, flight frequency and the number and size of aircraft serviced. In CA, the increased bandwidth of 2Ku supports tiered services such as messaging, browsing and streaming and enables a variety of experiences and price points for passengers. Delta Air Lines has announced that it intends to offer free in-flight connectivity services to all of its passengers, and we believe that other airlines will wish to provide complimentary service to some or all of their passengers. We believe that the availability of free service will significantly increase passenger adoption and, correspondingly, the amount of bandwidth airlines must purchase to support the increased demand. We also expect to continue to receive service revenue from third parties. For example, we are currently engaged by T-Mobile to make our in-flight services available to its subscribers. Increase Adoption of Wireless Entertainment and CAS . Gogo Vision was available on nearly all Gogo-connected aircraft in CA and approximately 850 BA aircraft as of December 31, 2019. Through our Gogo Vision platform, airlines offer passengers a library of movies and TV shows for wireless streaming to personal devices. We expect wireless entertainment views to continue to grow, driven by increased awareness of the service, availability of additional content, increased use of Gogo TV (which delivers live content streamed directly to wireless devices), and the launch of Gogo Vision Touch, our seatback tablet screen technology developed in collaboration with Delta Air Lines. Additionally, we expect that the demand by airlines for connectivity-based applications that improve the passenger experience and operational efficiency will increase over the next several years. This trend will drive data usage on our network and demand for platform services from Gogo. 8 Reduce Our Investment per Aircraft In CA, we define investment per aircraft as the installed cost of airborne equipment less the proceeds received from an airline partner. Our investment per aircraft varies depending on the commercial terms of our contract with the airline, the technology deployed, and the type of aircraft equipment installed. We are leveraging our experience in reducing installation times to assist our airline partners and their installers in conducting installations as quickly and efficiently as possible. Our ability to leverage our growing portfolio of STCs will further reduce the cost and time required to install new fleets. We have a broad portfolio of STCs and service bulletins for aircraft types to be equipped with 2Ku, which allows us to reuse STCs to reduce the time and cost required to obtain certification and to accelerate installation schedules. As of December 31, 2019, we had STCs to support over 95% of the installations we plan to complete in 2020. In addition, the price paid by airline partners for our airborne equipment under our recently executed or amended contracts has increased compared to 2Kus launch pricing. Improve Profit Margins We have made substantial investments in our network, in-flight systems, in-flight service platforms and aviation partner support in order to serve aircraft operators globally. As we increase the number of aircraft online, particularly in BA and CA-ROW, we expect to achieve benefits of scale as we have in CA-NA. In addition, through execution of our Integrated Business Plan, Gogo 2020, which was designed to improve our operational and financial performance by reducing our cost structure, improving quality, increasing revenue and streamlining business processes, we saw profit margin improvement in 2019 and expect our profit margins to continue to improve. We also anticipate continued decreases in unit costs for satellite capacity which, together with our bandwidth management capabilities, are expected to contribute to improvement in profitability over time. Contracts with Airline Partners In CA, we enter into connectivity agreements with our airline partners under which the airlines commit to have our equipment installed on some or all of the aircraft they operate, and we commit to provide passenger connectivity and/or entertainment services, and, in some circumstances, CAS, on such aircraft. We currently have definitive agreements to provide service on 21 commercial airlines. We have the exclusive right to provide Internet connectivity services on Gogo-installed aircraft throughout the term of the agreement in contracts with airline partners from which we derived a substantial majority of our consolidated revenue in 2019. The majority of our contracts with our airline partners have 10-year terms, with staggered expiration dates occurring on a fleet-by-fleet basis based on installation dates or on a contract basis, depending on the contract. Under our current contracts, the first expiration will occur in 2020 and the last in 2030 or later, depending on the timing of future installations. We offer airline partners a variety of business models and work with each airline to tailor the model to meet its needs. We began our CA business with the turnkey model, under which we provide the airline with the full range of our services, charge the passenger for passenger connectivity or Gogo Vision services at prices we determine and remit to the airline a specified percentage of passenger revenue. Under such model, for satellite-based connectivity services, the airline typically pays Gogo a monthly fee for network monitoring and management services. Under some of our agreements, airlines have adopted or have the option to adopt an airline-directed model, whereby the airline partner has flexibility to determine which of the many end-to-end services it wants Gogo to provide, which services it wants to provide itself and how it wishes to price the services provided to passengers. For example, an airline may elect to be the retailer for in-flight connectivity and entertainment services to its passengers, rather than using Gogo as the distributor, or to offer our services on a complimentary basis to some or all of its passengers. In such case, we negotiate the fees the airline pays us for the connectivity and entertainment services provided, the bandwidth consumed, and any other services provided by Gogo. 9 Depending on the contract, installation and maintenance services may be performed by us and/or the airline. When we provide such services, under some agreements, we include charges for installation and maintenance in our equipment pricing package; in other circumstances, the airline pays us directly for such services. Under certain contracts, we provide equipment credits or other incentives based on the number of aircraft installed with our equipment and the timing of such installations. Our contracts with airline partners set forth specified timelines for the installation or delivery of our airborne equipment, as well as service level commitments, and our failure to meet such timelines or service level commitments generally requires us to pay penalties or liquidated damages to the airlines and in certain circumstances may result in our airline partners being permitted to terminate all or a portion of the contract. As of December 31, 2019, inflight entertainment (IFE), which includes Gogo Vision, Gogo TV or Gogo Vision Touch, was included in the scope of services under agreements with eleven of our airline partners and we are discussing with other airline partners the possibility of providing IFE on their installed fleets. We also provide certain airline partners with CAS, such as real-time credit card processing for passenger food and beverage purchases, flight crew access to real-time weather information, EFB applications and voice services in the cockpit. Revenue from service provided on aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines (Delta) accounted for approximately 28% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 (equipment revenue from Delta was immaterial due to the fact that equipment transactions under the turnkey model are not considered a sale for accounting purposes). We are currently the exclusive in-flight connectivity service provider for Delta. As of February 29, 2020, we provided (i) ATG service on 334 domestic regional jets and 185 domestic mainline aircraft; (ii) Ku service on 175 aircraft, two-thirds of which operate primarily on international routes; and (iii) 2Ku service on 575 aircraft of which the vast majority fly primarily domestic routes. We have three principal contracts with Delta, all of which extend to 2027 with the exception of the 185 domestic mainline aircraft on which ATG service is provided, the contract for which will expire in 2022. We are currently in discussions with Delta with respect to its plans to provide free in-flight connectivity services to passengers. Based on such discussions, it is likely that Delta, as part of its transition to free service, will seek to pursue a supplier diversification strategy for its domestic mainline fleet (on which we predominantly provide 2Ku service) and divide such fleet between Gogo and another in-flight connectivity provider. Delta has not issued any notice of termination with respect to any Gogo-installed aircraft, and we do not believe that Delta has made any decisions as to the number or types of aircraft to be awarded to Gogo and other providers. While our negotiations are ongoing, we expect that Deltas transition to free-to-passengers service will significantly increase demand and enable us to increase our revenue from the Delta relationship. Our contracts with Delta provide for early termination by the airline in specified circumstances and allow the airline to terminate the contract should the percentage of passengers using the Gogo service on the airlines flights not meet certain thresholds. We currently experience, and for the last five years have experienced, connectivity take rates in excess of those thresholds. Such contracts also permit termination by the airline prior to expiration upon the occurrence of other certain contractually stipulated events, including our failure to meet service level requirements and the circumstance in which another company provides an alternate connectivity service that is a material improvement over our passenger connectivity service, such that failing to adopt such service would likely cause competitive harm to the airline, and we are unable to match the competitive offer in terms of price, technology and schedule. Delta also has the right to terminate its contracts for convenience with respect to certain fleets on or after specified dates, subject to payment of a specified termination fee. No other airline partner accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 900 CA aircraft on which we expected to install our 2Ku system under existing contracts and awards not yet under contract, which we refer to as backlog. Our backlog 10 includes current aircraft online that are being upgraded to 2Ku. Our backlog may be impacted by a number of factors including decisions by airlines to exercise their contractual rights to have aircraft installed or deinstalled with our equipment, as a result of changes in fleet plans or otherwise. As backlog is based on various estimates and assumptions of management, we can provide no assurance that our backlog is indicative of future aircraft online. Competition Commercial Aviation Our key competitors include Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Inmarsat, SITAONAIR, Panasonic Avionics Corp., Collins Aerospace, Thales, ViaSat and Safran (formerly known as Zodiac Inflight Innovations), all of which provide different technologies and strategies to provide in-flight connectivity and/or entertainment. We are the only telecommunications company focused exclusively on in-flight connectivity and in-flight entertainment and their unique requirements. We believe that our competitive advantages include the breadth of our technological solutions, our global coverage, our operational excellence, the variety of business models we offer to airlines and, increasingly, our ability to offer equipment through the OEM channel. The strategic priorities, offerings and capabilities of our competitors vary, including the variety of technologies available for various aircraft types, the ability to offer in-flight Internet solutions and video entertainment offerings, the ability to cost-effectively provide offerings on a global basis, the ability to manage capacity constraints, and the ability to offer, incorporate and manage new in-flight connectivity technologies and solutions as they become available. Business Aviation We compete against both equipment and telecommunications service providers to the business aviation market, including Honeywell Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Satcom Direct, Inmarsat and ViaSat. Also, Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Panasonic Avionics Corp. and SmartSky Networks have announced that they intend to enter the business aviation market. Licenses and Regulation Federal Aviation Administration The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. We regularly obtain STCs for each aircraft type operated by each airline partner on whose aircraft our equipment will be installed and separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different airlines. After obtaining an STC, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a Parts Manufacturer Approval, or PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facilitys production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements. Certain of our FCC licenses are conditioned upon our ability to obtain from the FAA a No Hazard Determination for our cell sites, which indicates that a proposed structure will not, if built as specified, create a 11 hazard to air navigation. When building or altering certain cell sites, we may first be required to obtain such a determination. Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified engineering and other professionals. In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures, and quality control systems continue to meet FAA requirements. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities or on aircraft. Foreign Aviation Regulation According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the airworthiness of U.S.-registered and FAA type-certificated aircraft on which FAA-certified Gogo equipment is installed is recognized by civil aviation authorities (CAAs) worldwide that are signatories to that Convention. As a result, Gogo does not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering Gogo equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA other than the United States, the installation of Gogo equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority. The FAA holds bilateral agreements with a number of certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement (BAA) or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA) with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart CAA. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircrafts country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a Validation Supplemental Type Certificate. For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, Gogo must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification, Gogo will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each airline partners service in any country in which it registers aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on our airline partners fleets. U.S. Department of Transportation The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) established an Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transport to negotiate and develop a proposed rule concerning accommodations for passengers with disabilities in three basic areas, including IFE and closed captioning of IFE. The Committee issued a resolution in late 2016 which included its recommendations to the DOT for a rule on IFE. Since a final rule on IFE has not been issued, however, it is unclear how, if at all, it may impact Gogo. According to the Report on DOT Significant Rulemakings dated August 2019, the publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by DOT on Accessible IFE has been delayed and the new projected date for publication of the NPRM on Accessible IFE is October 30, 2020. 12 Federal Communications Commission Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), the FCC licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless operations. The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCCs prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of Gogo by non-U.S. individuals or entities. Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. For example, our BA business provides some of its voice and data services (not including Gogo Biz or AVANCE) by reselling the telecommunications services of two satellite operators. Because we provide these services on a common carrier basis, we are subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. In addition, our BA segment provides an interconnected voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service. The FCC applies many, but not all, of the same regulatory requirements to interconnected VoIP service as it does to common carrier telecommunications services. We offer connectivity service in the United States to commercial and business aviation aircraft through our own facilities, using our ATG License, a nationwide commercial air-ground radiotelephone license in the 800 MHz band. We obtained and paid for this spectrum through an auction conducted by the FCC. See ATG License Terms and Conditions. On June 12, 2015, our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services became classified as Title II telecommunications services, subject to FCC common carrier regulation and broad net neutrality rules pursuant to an FCC order released March 12, 2015 (the Open Internet Order). The Open Internet Order prohibited broadband providers from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contained an exception for reasonable network management. However, on January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order (the Restoring Internet Freedom Order) that repealed most of the Open Internet Order, reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a lightly regulated, non-common carrier information service, and removed virtually all of the compliance obligations that the Open Internet Order imposed on our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services. The Restoring Internet Freedom Order went into effect on June 11, 2018. Under the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, Gogo may remain subject to certain modified transparency obligations that require disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms. In its October 1, 2019 Mozilla Corp. v. FCC decision, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit partially upheld the Restoring Internet Freedom Order but vacated the FCCs categorical preemption of state regulation and remanded several issues back to the FCC for further explanation. To the extent the FCC further restricts reasonable network management on remand, or to the extent the Mozilla petitioners prevail on further appellate review, our business may be affected. Our Internet access service is also subject to the FCCs data roaming rules, which require commercial mobile data service (CMDS) providers like Gogo to negotiate roaming arrangements with any requesting facilities-based, technologically compatible providers of CMDS. The rules do not give other providers the right to install equipment on Gogo-equipped aircraft and do not require the Gogo service to be provided on a discounted basis, although the arrangement must be commercially reasonable. The rules allow us to take reasonable measures to safeguard the quality of our service against network congestion that may result from roaming traffic. Neither the Open Internet Order nor the Restoring Internet Freedom Order altered Gogos obligations with respect to data roaming, but the FCC has committed to revisiting data roaming rules in the future. 13 In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible to persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content offered through our Gogo Vision and Gogo TV services. In addition to the two ATG licenses, we hold other FCC licenses, including microwave licenses that are used for backhaul in our terrestrial network, one fixed satellite earth station license used for network testing and support, one experimental license used for testing equipment, two aircraft radio licenses, and an authorization for the provision of voice and data services between the United States and foreign points. We also hold a license for blanket authority to operate up to 2,000 Ku-band satellite transceivers on aircraft at any one time, which allows us to provide domestic and international broadband service (although some countries require additional authorizations of their own). ATG License Terms and Conditions The FCC issued our ATG License on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term. We have satisfied our obligation under the license to provide substantial service to aircraft, and on January 25, 2017, we received confirmation from the FCC that the license has been renewed until October 31, 2026. Our 1 MHz ATG license obtained in 2013 from LiveTV Airfone, LLC was also originally issued on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term, although there is no substantial service obligation that attaches to this license. Our application to renew our license was subsequently granted for an additional 10-year term. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is not currently clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. Our two ATG licenses contain certain conditions that require us to comply with all applicable FCC and FAA rules as well as all bilateral agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico regarding the frequencies that are allocated for ATG services. These agreements apply to our use of the spectrum in areas adjacent to the United States northern and southern borders and in and out of Canadian and Mexican airspace. A bilateral ATG spectrum coordination agreement between the U.S. and Canada has been negotiated and approved and a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico is pending. In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary a subordinate license that allows us to use Canadian ATG spectrum of which SkySurf Communications Inc. is the primary licensee. In 2012, we entered into the License Agreement with SkySurf, which has an initial term of ten years commencing on August 14, 2012, and, provided that the primary spectrum license agreement issued by Industry Canada (now Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada or ISED) to SkySurf remains in effect at such dates, is renewable at our option for an additional 10-year term following the initial expiration and thereafter for a further five-year term. The term of the License Agreement, including the initial 10-year term and any renewals, is contingent on the effectiveness of the primary spectrum license issued by Industry Canada to SkySurf which was recently renewed for an eight-year term expiring June 29, 2027. Any future coordination agreement with Mexico and/or a Mexican ATG licensee could affect our ability to provide our broadband Internet service in the border areas using our current cell sites at current operating power levels and could affect our ability to establish or maintain ATG service in the border areas as aircraft fly into and out of Mexican airspace. Once a provider of ATG services is licensed in Mexico, we hope to negotiate an arrangement that will provide seamless connectivity on flights between Mexico and the United States. 14 Equipment Certification We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of CA or BA services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCCs technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained. Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations We collect personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our service. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties. We use the information that we collect to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection and use of such information are intended to comply with our privacy policy, which is posted on our website; applicable law; and our contractual obligations to airlines, customers, and other third parties; as well as industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Notwithstanding the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which reclassified broadband Internet access as a Title I information service, we must continue to comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Although the FTCs authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by communications common carriers has not been fully delineated, we believe that the FTC has jurisdiction over all of our services. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that among other things: (1) collect, use, share, or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the companys actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information. We are also subject to state mini-FTC Acts, which prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state. Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) took effect January 1, 2020 and provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA also imposes compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent, and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The CCPA was recently amended to, among other things, delay certain of the notice, deletion, and opt-out requirements with respect to employees and contractors, and to data collected in certain business-to-business communications, until January 1, 2021. The California Office of the Attorney General has proposed regulations to implement portions of the CCPA. The California Legislature may consider amendments to the CCPA during this years legislative session. Additionally, an initiative proposing a California Privacy Rights Act, which would amend the CCPA, may be on the November 2020 ballot in California. Depending on the final text of the regulations, any legislative 15 amendments, and the passage of the ballot initiative, the measures we are required to take to comply with the CCPA may be significantly impacted. Congress and state legislatures have also been considering legislation relating to privacy and data breaches. Should any additional laws be enacted, they could affect our business. As we expand our operations to include a physical international presence, or otherwise expand our collection of personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On May 25, 2018, the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect, which has imposed more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the European Union that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. In addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries. For example, both Switzerland and the member states of the European Union impose restrictions on transferring such data to countries, including the U.S., that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. Certain mechanisms apply under Swiss and European Union member state laws that permit the cross-border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Gogo has entered into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union and Switzerland to legitimize these transfers. The regulation of data privacy and security in the EU and in other jurisdictions continues to evolve. EU member states also have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for certain data processing activities Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection The FCCs Truth in Billing rules require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our satellite-based BA services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. However, the FCC has recently initiated a proceeding to revise and potentially extend certain of its Truth in Billing rules, and any changes the FCC adopts may affect our compliance obligations. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on ATG services. CALEA The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, which include Gogo, are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered service providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures. We have implemented such policies and procedures and, based upon our periodic self-assessments, we believe that our network is compliant with CALEA. Foreign Government Approvals In connection with our satellite service, we have implemented a process for obtaining any required authority needed to provide our service in the airspace over foreign countries or verifying that no additional authorization is needed. Each country over which a Gogo-equipped aircraft flies has the right to limit, regulate ( e.g ., through a licensing regime) or prohibit the offering of our service. We may not be able to obtain the necessary authority for every country over which a partner airline flies. For some countries, we have not been and do not expect to be able to obtain a definitive answer regarding their potential regulation of our service, and we may incur some regulatory risk by operating in the airspace over these countries. Failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements could result in penalties being imposed on Gogo and/or on its airline partners, allow airline partners 16 affected by such requirements to terminate their contracts with us prior to expiration or, under a contract with one of our airline partners, require us to pay liquidated damages. Regulation by U.S. and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. Moreover, even countries that have previously provided clearance for our service have the right to change their regulations at any time. Seasonality The demand for air travel, including business travel, is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect our overall passenger opportunity to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year due to an increase in leisure travel offset in part by a decrease in business travel during the summer months and holidays. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us. We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States and certain countries outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2019, we held U.S. patents expiring on dates ranging from June 2020 to January 2038, and foreign patents expiring on dates ranging from August 2020 to June 2035. We do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective. We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the United States and certain other countries include, among others, Gogo, Gogo Biz and Gogo Vision, although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We license or purchase from third parties technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors. We also license our proprietary technology and software to third parties to enable them to integrate such technology and software into the products they provide to us. Many of our agreements with such third parties are renewable for indefinite periods of time unless either party chooses to terminate, although some of our agreements expire after fixed periods and require renegotiation prior to expiration in order to extend the term. Among the most material of our technology-related agreements are those for modems, base stations and antennas. Our agreements for modems, base stations and antennas do not renew automatically and thus require periodic renegotiation. Such agreements as well as certain licenses to commercially available software are material to our business. We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, vendors, and airline partners. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained. 17 Employees As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,115 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Corporate Information Gogo Inc. is a holding company that does business through its subsidiaries. Our principal operating subsidiaries are Gogo LLC and Gogo Business Aviation LLC, which are direct, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC.

Risk Factors You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below. 18 Risks Related to Our CA Business We are dependent on agreements with our airline partners to be able to access passengers and provide services to airlines for use by the crew and airline operations. Payments for our services on commercial airlines have provided, and will continue to provide, a significant portion of our revenue. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from these agreements on a timely basis or to renew any existing agreements upon expiration or termination may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had our equipment installed and provided our Gogo service to passengers on aircraft operated by 20 airlines and we had a definitive contract with one additional airline. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Gogo service we provide on commercial aircraft generated approximately 53%, 49% and 64% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Our ability to meet our commitments to certain of our customers requires us to reach agreements with OEMs to have our equipment installed on newly manufactured aircraft by the OEM, which will require us to comply with OEM specifications, which may be costly and time-consuming. Our growth is dependent on our ability to have our equipment installed on additional aircraft and increase passenger use of the Gogo service on installed aircraft. Any delays in installations under these contracts may negatively affect our relationships with airline partners and our ability to maintain or grow our passenger user base and revenue, as may unavailability or degradation of our service resulting from the failure of our equipment or software or other factors. In addition, we have no assurance that any of our current airline partners will renew their existing contracts with us upon expiration, or that they will not terminate their contracts prior to expiration upon the occurrence of certain contractually stipulated events. Contractual termination events include our bankruptcy and our material breach of contract, which in certain contracts is defined to include material breach of our service level agreements, and/or failure to achieve certain certification, equipment delivery, installation or other milestones within agreed-upon time frames. Several contracts with airline partners permit such airline to terminate the contract if the percentage of passengers using connectivity on such airlines flights falls below certain negotiated thresholds. One contract with an airline partner from which we derived a significant portion, but less than a majority, of our 2019 consolidated revenue permits such airline partner to terminate its contract with us if the airlines revenue share falls below certain thresholds and Gogo elects to not make the airline whole for such revenue share shortfall. Contracts with airline partners from which in the aggregate we derived a significant portion, but less than a majority of our 2019 consolidated revenue allow those airlines to terminate a portion or all of their respective agreements for convenience, in some instances with no fee required. Depending on the contract, the airline may exercise such termination right at any time following contract signing or after a specified period of time passes following signing. Additionally, our contracts with Delta and certain other airline partners, from which in the aggregate we derived a significant portion, but less than a majority of our 2019 consolidated revenue, permit such airline partners to terminate all or a portion of their contracts if another company provides a connectivity service that is a material improvement over our service, such that failing to adopt such alternative service would likely cause competitive harm to the airline, and we are unable to match the competitive offer in terms of price, technology and schedule. Such termination right was previously exercised by one of our airline partners as a basis for early termination of its contract with respect to certain Gogo-installed aircraft and could in the future be invoked by airline partners who wish to deinstall Gogo equipment from certain aircraft prior to contract expiration, including for the purpose of achieving supplier diversification. To the extent that our airline partners terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us for any reason, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Certain of our contracts with our airline partners include provisions that, under certain circumstances, entitle our airline partners to the benefit of certain more favorable provisions in other airline partners connectivity agreements, including terms related to termination, maintenance, service and equipment and bandwidth pricing. These provisions, some of which have retroactive effect, may limit the benefits we realize from contracts containing such provisions. In addition, our inability to identify and offer improved terms to an airline partner in accordance with such a provision could negatively affect our relationship with that airline partner or give rise to a claim that we are in breach of such connectivity agreement. 19 A failure to maintain airline and passenger satisfaction with our equipment or the Gogo service could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. Our relationships with our airline partners are critical to the growth and success of our business. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, use of the Gogo service on Delta aircraft accounted for approximately 28%, 23% and 26%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. If our airline partners are not satisfied with our equipment or the Gogo service for any reason, they may reduce efforts to co-market the Gogo service to their passengers, which together with passenger dissatisfaction could result in lower passenger usage and reduced revenue. In addition, airline dissatisfaction with us for any reason, including delays in obtaining certification for or installation of our equipment, failure of our system to meet specifications, or our failure to comply with our service level obligations, could negatively affect our relationship with the airline partner and our reputation among passengers and other airlines and constitute a breach of contract resulting in penalties, claims for damages or termination rights. We have experienced and continue to experience capacity constraints in the United States on our ATG network and may in the future experience additional capacity demands on that network and our United States and international satellite networks. If we fail to meet capacity demands, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The success of our CA business depends on our ability to provide adequate bandwidth to meet customer demands. The capacity of our ATG network is limited by the spectrum licensed and, as a result, we have in the past experienced significant capacity constraints in the United States and continue to encounter occasional capacity constraints on flights where demand for our service is high and certain routes on which multiple ATG aircraft are within range of the same cell site at one time. As part of our plan to alleviate such constraints, we are deploying our satellite-based technology and developing a next-generation ATG technology, which will provide additional capacity, but the successful implementation of such technology is subject to certain risks and uncertainties as described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section under the heading  We may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying our next-generation ATG technology.  In addition, our ability to meet capacity demands on our ATG network depends in part on the willingness of airline partners to agree to install or upgrade to our next generation ATG network if and when we deploy that solution. In addition, we may in the future experience capacity constraints on our satellite network. We obtain the capacity required for our Ku and 2Ku satellite-based systems from satellite partners with whom we contract on a non-exclusive basis, and our ability to obtain sufficient capacity in the United States and internationally is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See the disclosure elsewhere in this Risk Factors section under the heading  We face risks related to satellites and satellite capacity.  We expect capacity demands to increase on both our ATG and satellite networks as we install our equipment on more airlines and aircraft and as passenger adoption and bandwidth requirements grow. In particular, we are currently negotiating amendments to contracts with certain airline partners under which our services would be provided by the airlines to passengers free of charge. We expect passenger adoption and associated capacity demands to increase significantly if airline partners implement free passenger connectivity service. If our airline partners move to a free-to-passengers business model, in order to meet such demands, we will be required to negotiate agreements with existing and new satellite providers to obtain additional Ku-band satellite capacity. Our ability to successfully support our airline partners, including those providing free service to passengers, will depend in part on our ability to obtain sufficient satellite capacity, particularly in the continental United States, at prices and on other terms acceptable to us. If our airline partners implement free service to passengers on aircraft operating on our ATG network, the capacity constraints discussed above could be exacerbated. Furthermore, we may be required to develop and deploy systems employing Ka-band satellite technology for our airline partners and to obtain sufficient Ka-based capacity to support such technologies. We have in the past committed to purchase and, in some circumstances, paid for our satellite capacity in advance of employing it, and we may be required to do so in the future. 20 We use bandwidth management tools to manage capacity in both our ATG and satellite networks. In June 2015, the FCC adopted broad net neutrality rules pursuant to an order released in March 2015 (the Open Internet Order). The Open Internet Order prohibited broadband providers from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contained an exception for reasonable network management. In June 2018, the FCCs partial repeal of the Open Internet Order (the Restoring Internet Freedom Order) became effective, eliminating virtually all of the then-existing net neutrality obligations applicable to us. A federal appeals court partially upheld the Restoring Internet Freedom Order in October 2019 with some exceptions that include vacating provisions of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order that categorically preempts states from imposing any rule or requirement that the FCC repealed or declined to impose, as well as state net neutrality rules or regulations that are more stringent than those adopted in the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. Members of Congress have proposed legislation that would reinstate certain net neutrality rules and the outcome of such proposals or other attempts to reinstate net neutrality rules cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, several states, including California, have proposed or enacted net neutrality legislation similar in substance to the Open Internet Order. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed suit to block the California legislation and California has agreed to delay implementation of the law pending the outcome of such litigation. If the federal neutrality rules were reinstated, they could constrain our ability to manage our network and make it more difficult for us to meet capacity demands, as could existing or future state net neutrality laws or additional federal net neutrality laws. There can be no assurance that the actions we are taking will be sufficient to provide enough capacity in the United States or internationally. If we fail to meet capacity demands, it could negatively affect our relationship with our airline partners and our reputation among passengers and other airlines and constitute a breach of contract resulting in penalties, claims for damages or termination rights, and our business prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our business is highly dependent on the airline industry, which is itself affected by factors beyond the airlines control, including the novel strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The airline industry is highly competitive and sensitive to changing economic conditions. Our business is directly affected by the number of passengers flying on commercial aircraft, the financial condition of the airlines and other economic factors. If consumer demand for air travel declines, including due to environmental concerns or regulation, increased use of technology such as videoconferencing for business travelers, or the number of aircraft and flights shrinks due to, among other reasons, reductions in capacity by airlines, the number of passengers available to use the Gogo service will be reduced, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Unfavorable general economic conditions and other events that are beyond the airlines control, including higher unemployment rates, higher interest rates, reduced stock prices, reduced consumer and business spending, outbreaks of communicable diseases and terrorist attacks or threats could have a material adverse effect on the airline industry. In particular, the recent outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan, China has resulted in global travel restrictions and the suspension of certain commercial flights by some of our airline partners, which has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our CA business. In recent weeks, we have seen significantly reduced demand on aircraft operated in the Asia Pacific region as compared to demand levels in January 2020 before COVID-19 affected travel. More recently, demand for both business and leisure airline travel on a global basis has declined significantly due to COVID-19, and airlines are responding by cancelling additional flights, including domestic U.S. flights. All of our U.S. airline partners have announced international and domestic capacity reductions, and in the week in which this report is being filed, we are seeing for the first time reduced demand on domestic U.S. flights as a result of COVID-19. In addition, on March 11, 2020 the President of the United States announced a 30-day suspension of travel from 26 European countries to the U.S. and similar or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions could further materially impact business and leisure 21 airline travel. We expect COVID-19 to continue to have a significant negative impact on CA revenue and are unable to predict how long that impact will continue. To date, we have not seen any impact of COVID-19 on our BA business. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the CA and BA businesses and our financial and operational performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If our airline partners continue to experience significantly reduced demand for passenger traffic for an extended period, our 2020 consolidated results of operations and our liquidity and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. The extent to which the outbreak affects our earnings and liquidity will depend in part on our ability to implement various measures intended to reduce expenses and/or conserve cash. Earnings in CA-ROW may be particularly affected if reduced demand for travel continues, as we provide service in that segment solely via satellite-based systems and satellite capacity and certain other costs are largely fixed. Further, travel and other restrictions adopted in response to COVID-19 may impact our ability to complete installations on certain aircraft and successfully operate our services on aircraft that operate in regions affected by the coronavirus, particularly where travel is restricted. Additionally, our suppliers or other third parties we rely upon to install and maintain our services may experience delays or shortages, which could have an adverse effect on our business prospects and results of operations. A general reduction or shift in discretionary spending could result in decreased demand for leisure and business travel and lead to a reduction in airline flights offered and the number of passengers flying. Consolidation within the airline industry could also adversely affect our relationships with our existing airline partners or lead to Gogo-equipped aircraft being taken out of service. Further, unfavorable economic conditions, including conditions associated with COVID-19, could also limit airlines ability to counteract increased fuel, labor or other costs through raised prices. Our airline partners operate in a highly competitive business market and, as a result, continue to face pressure on offerings and pricing. These unfavorable conditions and the competitiveness of the air travel industry could cause one or more of our airline partners to reduce expenditures on passenger services including deployment of the Gogo service or to file for bankruptcy. If one or more of our airline partners were to file for bankruptcy, bankruptcy laws could give them rights to terminate their contracts with us, they could reduce their total fleet size and capacity and/or their total number of flights, and/or they could attempt to renegotiate the terms of their contracts with us including the pricing of our equipment and services. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We face risks related to satellites and satellite capacity. We rely on third-party suppliers for the satellite capacity required to provide our Ku and 2Ku services and currently have agreements with several satellite partners to provide Ku-band satellite service on a non-exclusive basis. Service is typically provided through individual service orders for specified transponders, which range in duration from one to ten years. If any of these agreements were terminated or not renewed upon expiration, or if any of our satellite partners fail to obtain, or lose, necessary regulatory authorizations, we could face material delays or interruptions in the provision of service to our customers that rely on satellite service for connectivity or other services and we may not be able to find alternative satellite partners on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Certain of our agreements with satellite service providers commit us to purchase bandwidth up to ten years in advance, which may be inadequate to meet capacity demands or may exceed passenger demand and require us to incur unnecessary costs. See  We have experienced and continue to experience capacity constraints in the United States on our ATG network and may in the future experience additional capacity demands on that network and our United States and international satellite networks. If we fail to meet capacity demands, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The usefulness of the satellites upon which we currently rely and may rely on in the future is limited by each satellites minimum design life. For example, the satellites through which we provide Ku-band service have minimum design lives ranging from 10 to 15 years. Our ability to offer in-flight connectivity outside North America 22 and alleviate capacity constraints throughout our network depends on the continued operation of the satellites or any replacement satellites, each of which has a limited useful life. We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual operational lives of those or future satellites, which may be shorter than their design lives, nor can we provide assurance that replacement satellites will be developed, authorized or successfully deployed. In the event of a failure or loss of any of these satellites, our satellite service providers may relocate another satellite and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such a relocation may require regulatory approval, including through, among other things, a showing that the replacement satellite would not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite. We cannot be certain that our satellite service providers could obtain such regulatory approval. In addition, we cannot guarantee that another satellite will be available for use as a replacement for a failed or lost satellite, or that such relocation can be accomplished without disrupting or otherwise adversely impacting our business. Certain satellites we currently plan to utilize to provide Ku-band satellite service have not yet been launched. Satellite construction and launch are subject to significant risks, including delays, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites and to obtain other launch opportunities. Construction and launch delays, including any delay in the launch of satellites intended to replace one of the satellites we currently plan to utilize to provide Ku-band satellite service, may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may not be able to grow our business with current airline partners or successfully negotiate agreements with airlines to which we do not currently provide the Gogo service; the outcome of negotiations with airline partners regarding a business model under which the airlines provide free service to passengers and the effect of this shift and other possible shifts in business models on our revenue and results of operations cannot be predicted. We are currently in negotiations or discussions with certain of our airline partners to provide our equipment and the Gogo service on additional aircraft in their fleets. We have no assurance that these efforts will be successful. We are also in discussions with other airlines to provide our equipment and the Gogo service to some or all of their aircraft. Negotiations with current and prospective airline partners require substantial time, effort and resources. The time required to reach a final agreement with an airline is unpredictable and may lead to variances in our operating results from quarter to quarter. We may ultimately fail in our negotiations and any such failure could harm our results of operations due to, among other things, a diversion of our focus and resources, actual costs incurred in the negotiation process and opportunity costs. In addition, the terms of any future agreements could be materially different and less favorable to us than the terms included in our existing agreements with our airline partners, which could trigger most favored nations provisions of contracts with certain existing airline partners, which could result in our inability to achieve the originally anticipated benefits of such contracts. Under our turnkey model, we provide the connectivity service, determine passenger pricing and share revenue with the airline. Several of our airline partners have adopted or have the option to adopt the airline-directed model, under which the airlines purchase bandwidth from us and distribute it to their passengers on a paid or complimentary basis. Under the airline-directed model, the airline retains pricing discretion over the cost of our service to passengers and the extent to which we receive revenue under this model is directly related to passenger usage. As a result, a failure by airlines to price our service appropriately has and could continue to adversely affect our results. We are currently in negotiations with certain airline partners regarding amendments to our existing contracts that would enable such partners to offer free Gogo service to their passengers under our airline-directed business model and other airline partners may elect to move to a free-to-passengers business model. We expect commercial models and contract terms to continue to evolve, and we anticipate that third-party payors (including airlines) will generate an increasing portion of our revenue and that the portion of our revenue paid by passengers using our service will decline. Certain airline partners have recently shifted or informed us that they intend to shift from the airline-directed model to the turnkey model, and we are unable to predict to 23 what extent future shifts in commercial models will occur or the effect that such shifts in models will have on our results of operations. In addition, our growth will depend in part on our ability to reach agreements with OEMs to have our equipment factory-installed on certain aircraft, which will require us to comply with OEM specifications, which may be costly and time-consuming. To the extent that any negotiations with current or potential airline partners are unsuccessful, or any existing or future agreements, including those reflecting evolving business models and/or a shift to free passenger service under the airline-directed model, prove generally less favorable to us than expected or as compared to previous agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Competition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and harm our results of operations. We face intense competition from providers of satellite-based broadband connectivity and in-flight entertainment services. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations, have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources and may be better able to withstand the effects of pricing pressures or periodic economic downturns or may offer a broader product line to customers, including services we do not currently provide and/or may not provide in the future. With respect to our ATG services, while we are currently the only provider of ATG service in North America, a competitor is developing a North American air-to-ground 4G network that may become available this year using unlicensed spectrum, and other competitors could enter this business using the same or other spectrum. Internationally, one of our competitors has built a hybrid satellite and air-to-ground network to provide broadband service over Europe that became operational in 2019. With respect to our satellite services, the increased availability, development and adoption of satellite-based services by commercial airlines around the world has and will continue to put additional pressure on our ability to maintain our market position, and we expect our market position to decline as our competitors install more aircraft with their satellite-based systems in the U.S. and internationally. Two of our competitors are satellite owners and operators and it is possible that other satellite providers will enter the market and sell bandwidth directly to airlines. Due to their different business model, such competitors may be able to provide equipment and services at prices more competitive than ours or offer services we do not provide. We believe that the principal points of competition in CA are technological capabilities, geographic coverage, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support and timeliness, and, increasingly, the availability of factory installation. Some of our competitors offer factory installation on aircraft types on which Gogo has not yet met OEM requirements. Airlines desire for supplier diversification is also a factor in selection of connectivity providers. Several of our earlier contracts where we were the sole connectivity provider for the airline were signed at a time when our industry had fewer competitors. Over time, more providers have entered our business and many airlines have come to desire supplier diversification. We are currently in discussions with Delta with respect to its plans to provide free in-flight connectivity services to passengers. Based on such discussions, it is likely that Delta, as part of its transition to free service, will seek to pursue a supplier diversification strategy for its domestic mainline fleet and divide such fleet between Gogo and another connectivity provider. Delta has not issued any notice of termination with respect to any Gogo-installed aircraft, and we do not believe that Delta has made any decisions as to the number or types of aircraft to be awarded to Gogo and other providers. Depending on the number and type of aircraft that Delta determines to award to other providers, such action could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if existing airline partners determine to award Gogo-installed or new aircraft to competitors, our ability to maintain or gain market position could be adversely affected. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Increased competition for airline partners and aircraft or other market forces could force us to lower the prices we charge airlines for equipment and service or lose market share and could adversely affect our growth prospects and profitability. In 24 addition, to the extent that competing in-flight connectivity or entertainment services offered by commercial airlines are available on more aircraft or offer improved quality or reliability as compared to the Gogo service, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Competition among airlines with respect to the pricing of passenger services, as well as passengers expectations regarding pricing, may limit our ability to increase the price of our services under the turnkey model. Competition could increase our sales and marketing expenses and related customer acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to effectively respond to established and new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We face limitations on our ability to grow our domestic operations which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Our addressable market and our ability to expand domestically are limited by factors that include limitations on the number of U.S. commercial airlines with which we could partner, the number of planes in which our equipment can be installed, the passenger capacity within each plane, the ability of our network infrastructure or bandwidth to accommodate increasing capacity demands and our ability to successfully implement our technology roadmap on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our growth may slow, or we may stop growing altogether, to the extent that we have exhausted all potential airline partners and as we approach installation on full fleets and maximum penetration rates for passenger connectivity service on all flights. In such circumstances, to continue to grow our domestic revenue, we would have to rely on passenger and airline partner adoption of other currently available and new or developing services and additional offerings, including Gogo Vision, Gogo TV, and CAS. We may not be able to profitably expand our domestic operations and if we fail to do so, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our CA-ROW business has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance, and we may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally. We began our CA-ROW business in the first quarter of 2014, and its limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate the CA-ROW business and predict its future performance. The growth of our CA-NA segment since inception is not necessarily indicative of the future growth of CA-ROW. Any assessments of our current business and predictions that we or you make about the future financial and operating performance of CA-ROW or its effect on our consolidated financial and operating performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history in that segment. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability in CA-ROW involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in unfamiliar markets, limitations on such investment under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement (each as defined below) and economic and financial market conditions. Further, our expansion plans require significant management attention and resources, and our CA business has limited experience in selling our solutions in international markets as compared to North American markets, or in conforming to local cultures, standards or policies. Certain of our competitors, including current providers of satellite service, have more experience than we do in the international commercial airline connectivity and in-flight entertainment markets. As a result, such competitors may have pre-existing relationships with international airlines and more experience in obtaining regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions or may already offer their equipment as standard, line-fit options on aircraft types, which may negatively affect our ability to enter into agreements with international airline partners or to increase the number of aircraft on which our equipment is installed thereunder. As we expand our international business we expect to incur increased expenses related to establishing facilities and hiring employees in certain foreign locations and expanding international marketing and advertising efforts. We may not be able to compete successfully in these international markets, and we may be unable to enter into agreements on satisfactory terms to provide connectivity and entertainment services to international fleets of our existing North American airline partners and to new international airline partners. In addition, our ability to expand will be limited by the demand for in-flight broadband Internet access in international markets. Any failure to compete successfully in international markets could also negatively impact our reputation and domestic operations. 25 Our current and future international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in foreign operations, including: legal and regulatory restrictions, including communications, privacy, censorship, aerospace and liability standards, intellectual property laws and enforcement practices, as well as United States and foreign export and import controls; changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs; restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries, including restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications providers and imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); inability to find content or service providers to partner with on commercially reasonable terms; compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the (U.K.) Bribery Act 2010 and other similar anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and related risks, which risks could be increased by our interaction with employees of certain foreign government-owned airlines who are deemed government officials under the FCPA and certain other anti-corruption laws and regulations; uncertainties and effects arising from the United Kingdoms departure from the European Union, including financial, trade, tax and legal implications; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; currency fluctuations; and potential adverse tax consequences. As a result of these obstacles, we may find it difficult or prohibitively expensive to grow our business internationally or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, which could harm our business, future operating results and financial condition. Our failure to successfully grow our business internationally or comply with laws and regulations to which we become subject as a result of doing business internationally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unsuccessful or delayed in continuing to deploy and operate our 2Ku technology. As of December 31, 2019, we had more than 1,400 2Ku systems installed and approximately 900 systems in our backlog. There can be no assurance that we can meet our installation goals on our current timeline, due to risks that include delays in airlines making aircraft available for installation (including without limitation delays resulting directly or indirectly from the FAAs order grounding Boeing 737 MAX aircraft); the failure of 2Ku-related equipment and software to perform as expected during testing or following installation, problems arising in the manufacturing process, our reliance on single-source and other suppliers to provide certain components and services, and delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. We have encountered delays and quality problems as we deploy 2Ku, including problems related to deicing fluid or other moisture entering our antennas which we believe that we have largely remediated, and may continue to do so given the aggressive installation schedule that we are undertaking and the demands that the schedule places on employees, suppliers and other resources. In addition, other providers of satellite-based connectivity services currently have services available for commercial deployment that are intended to compete directly with 2Ku, and airlines may choose to adopt such a service over 2Ku. Twenty domestic and international airlines have selected 2Ku for installation on all or a portion of their fleets. The failure of the 2Ku system to meet contractually agreed-upon specifications or to perform as expected, or significant delays in our ability to install 2Ku systems, have triggered and in the future 26 may trigger the payment of liquidated damages under certain such agreements, and could result in material breaches of such agreements which could in turn result in claims by airlines for damages or termination of such agreements. If 2Ku fails to perform as expected, including as a result of past quality issues recurring or new issues arising, or we fail to meet the installation timelines and performance metrics for which we have contracted, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our failure to timely deliver 2Ku could have a material adverse effect on our ability to alleviate capacity constraints in our network. See  We have experienced and continue to experience capacity constraints in the United States on our ATG network and may in the future experience additional capacity demands on that network and our United States and international satellite networks. If we fail to meet capacity demands, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We may be unsuccessful in generating or increasing revenue from Gogo Vision, our in-flight platform, Gogo TV, CAS and other services that we may offer in the future. The future growth prospects for our CA business depend, in part, on airlines or passengers paying for Gogo Vision on-demand video services, Gogo TV, CAS and new products and services that we develop in response to airline and passenger needs. Our ability to generate revenue from such services depends on: our ability to offer our services on new airlines and more aircraft and increase passenger adoption; our ability to obtain content (including digital rights to such content) from third parties for Gogo TV, Gogo Vision and new entertainment services; our ability to customize and improve services in response to trends and customer interests; our ability to develop new services; our ability to monetize existing and new services; the extent to which and pace at which airlines and other companies in the aviation industry adopt and utilize operational applications; and our ability to partner with third parties to develop and implement operational applications that are compatible with our networks. If we are unsuccessful in generating or increasing revenue from these services and our in-flight platform, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. A future act or threat of terrorism, cyber-attack or other event could result in reduced demand for our products and services or result in a prohibition on the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft. A future act of terrorism or cyber-attack on an aircraft, the threat of such acts or unrelated airline accidents could have an adverse effect on the airline industry. In such event, our industry may experience significantly reduced passenger demand. The U.S. federal government or foreign governments could respond to such events by prohibiting the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft, which would eliminate demand for our products and services. In addition, any association or perceived association between our equipment or service and the threat of terrorism, cyber-attacks or accidents involving aircraft on which our systems operate would likely have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services. Such reduced demand for our products and services may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Air traffic congestion at airports, air traffic control inefficiencies, weather conditions, such as hurricanes or blizzards, increased security measures, new travel-related taxes, the outbreak of disease or any other similar event could harm the airline industry. Airlines are subject to cancellations or delays due to weather conditions or natural disasters, air traffic control problems, including work stoppages or reduced government funding (including as a result of a 27 government shutdown), breaches in security, outbreaks of communicable diseases or other factors. Such cancellations or delays could reduce the number of passengers on commercial flights, reduce demand for our products and services and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our BA Business Equipment sales to OEMs and after-market dealers account for a substantial portion of our revenue and earnings in the BA segment, and the loss of an OEM or dealer customer could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability. Revenue from equipment sales on contracts with OEMs and after-market dealers accounted for approximately 28%, 32% and 28%, respectively, of the revenue generated by our BA segment for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Almost all of BAs contracts with OEM and dealer customers are terminable at will by either party. If a key OEM or dealer terminates its relationship with us for any reason or our contract expires and is not renewed, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Our OEM customers may be materially adversely impacted by economic downturns and market disruptions. In anticipation of changing economic conditions, our customers may be more conservative in their production, which may reduce our market opportunities. Further, unfavorable market conditions could cause one or more of our OEM customers to file for bankruptcy, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and could harm our results of operations. Our BA equipment and service are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand pricing pressures and the effects of periodic economic downturns or may offer a broader product line to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if our competitors: develop equipment or service that is superior to our equipment and service; develop equipment or service that is priced more competitively than our equipment and service; develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing equipment and services; or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We believe that the principal points of competition in our BA segment are technological capabilities, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer. In addition, competition may subject us to downward pricing pressures. Pricing at too high a level could adversely affect our ability to gain new customers and retain current customers, while increased competition could force us to lower our prices or lose market position and could adversely affect growth prospects and profitability. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to respond to established and new competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. A competitor is developing a North American air-to-ground 4G network that may become available as early as 2020 using unlicensed spectrum, and other competitors could enter this business using the same or other spectrum. 28 We generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our equipment. Further, we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers, so we take the risk for cost overruns. Many of our OEM customers may terminate their contracts with us on short notice and, in many cases, our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our equipment. In addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon non-binding production schedules provided by OEMs, the historical purchasing patterns of customers, and informal discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements. Cancellations, reductions or delays by customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, pursuant to many of our contracts with our OEM customers, we have agreed to deliver equipment and/or services, including equipment and services not yet in production, for a fixed price and, accordingly, take the risk of any cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Many of the risks that could harm our CA business could also adversely affect our BA business. In our BA segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, sales of ATG equipment accounted for more than 60% of equipment revenue, and subscriptions for our Gogo Biz in-flight broadband Internet service accounted for more than 85% of service revenue. Accordingly, many of the risks described above relating to our CA business may also have a material adverse effect on our BA business, including expected capacity constraints on our network in the near-term and our ability to manage those constraints, our ability to successfully develop and implement Gogo 5G and any next generation technology, our ability to successfully implement technology enhancements to our network and our ability to successfully develop and deploy new products and services and generate revenue and profits from the sale of such products and services. Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property and Regulation We may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying our next generation ATG technology. In May 2019, we announced that we are developing a next generation ATG network using 5G technology and unlicensed spectrum which we expect to become available in 2021. Gogo 5G will be capable of working with different spectrums and supporting different next generation technologies. There can be no assurance that we will launch Gogo 5G or any next generation technology in sufficient time to meet capacity demands and to effectively compete in ATG markets, due to, among other things, risks associated with: (i) our failure to design and develop a technology that provides the features and performance we require; (ii) integrating the solution with our existing ATG network; (iii) the availability of adequate spectrum; (iv) the failure of spectrum to perform as expected; (v) the failure of equipment and software to perform as expected; (vi) problems arising in the manufacturing process; (vii) our ability to negotiate contracts with suppliers on acceptable commercial and other terms; (viii) our reliance on single-source suppliers for the development and manufacturing of the core elements of the network and on other suppliers to provide certain components and services; and (ix) delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. If Gogo 5G or any next generation ATG technology fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines we establish, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our failure to timely deliver Gogo 5G or any next generation ATG technology could have a material adverse effect on our ability to alleviate capacity constraints in our network. See also Risks Related to our CA Business We have experienced and continue to experience capacity constraints in the United States on our ATG network and may in the future experience additional capacity demands on that network and our United States and international satellite networks. If we fail to meet capacity demands, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.  Our CA-NA and BA businesses are dependent on the availability of spectrum. In June 2006, we purchased at FCC auction an exclusive ten-year, 3 MHz license for ATG spectrum, and in April 2013, as part of our acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC, we acquired an additional 1MHz ATG spectrum 29 license. In 2017, our applications to renew our licenses were granted for additional ten-year terms without further payment. Any breach of the terms of our FCC licenses or FCC regulations including foreign ownership restrictions, permitted uses of the spectrum and compliance with FAA regulations could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of our licenses or a refusal by the FCC to renew the licenses upon expiration. Further, in connection with an application to renew our licenses upon expiration, a competitor could file a petition opposing such renewal on anti-competitive or other grounds. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is currently not clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. While we do not currently use this license, changes in technology may enable its use in our network in the future. An ambiguous renewal requirement could impair our flexibility to use or otherwise realize the value of such spectrum beyond 2026. Our ability to offer in-flight broadband Internet access through our ATG service currently depends on our ability to maintain rights to use the 3 MHz ATG spectrum in the U.S. and our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to meet increasing capacity demands and expand our service offerings in the United States will depend in part upon our ability to successfully roll-out our plans to employ unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band for concurrent use with the licensed 3 MHz spectrum and to launch Gogo 5G. While we are the exclusive licensee of the only United States spectrum dedicated to ATG connectivity, additional ATG spectrum, whether licensed or unlicensed, is or may become available in the United States or internationally in the future. While we have exclusive rights to the only spectrum licensed by the FCC for ATG use and are currently the only provider of ATG service in the United States, the FCC may in the future decide to auction additional spectrum for ATG use that is not currently designated for that purpose, or a competitor could develop technology or a business plan that allows it to cost effectively use spectrum not specifically reserved for ATG, but on which ATG use is not prohibited, to provide broadband connectivity. The availability of additional spectrum in the marketplace that is available for ATG use may increase the possibility that we may face competition from one or more other ATG service providers in the future. For example, a competitor has announced that it is developing a North American 4G ATG network using the same unlicensed spectrum that we intend to use in our Gogo 5G network. Additionally, one competitor in CA-ROW has built a European hybrid satellite and air-to-ground network to provide aviation customers connectivity service in Europe that became operational in 2019. Discussions occur in other regions from time to time regarding the use of spectrum for ATG service, and as a result, we may face competition from ATG providers in such regions. If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license. Under the Communications Act and applicable FCC regulations, we are effectively restricted from having more than 25% of our capital stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons, including individuals and entities organized outside the United States or controlled by non-U.S. persons. We have established procedures to ascertain the nature and extent of our foreign ownership, and we believe that the indirect ownership of our equity by foreign persons or entities is below the 25% cap. However, as a publicly traded company we may not be able to determine with certainty the exact amount of our stock that is held by foreign persons or entities at any given time. A failure to comply with applicable restrictions on ownership 30 by non-U.S. persons could result in an order to divest the offending ownership, fines, denial of license renewal and/or spectrum license revocation proceedings, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected if we suffer service interruptions or delays, technology failures, damage to our equipment or system disruptions or failures arising from, among other things, force majeure events, cyber-attacks or other malicious activities, or satellite failures. Our brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depend upon the reliable performance of our in-flight portal, network infrastructure, content delivery processes and payment systems. We have experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures that temporarily slowed down our portals performance and users access to the Internet, or made our portal inaccessible, and we may experience service interruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures in the future, which may be due to factors beyond our control. In the past, failures resulting in users not being able to access the service have often been remedied by bypassing the payment processing step for users and directly connecting such users to the Internet, leading to a loss of revenue for those sessions. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation, brand and customer retention could be harmed, we may lose revenue to the extent that we have to bypass the payment processing step in order to maintain users connectivity to the Internet, and such failures could be material breaches of airline contracts resulting in termination rights, penalties or airline claims for damages. Our operations and services depend upon the extent to which our equipment and the equipment of our third-party network providers is protected against damage or interruption from fire, floods, earthquakes, tornados, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events. The capacity, reliability and security of our network infrastructure are important to the operation of our business, which may suffer in the event of system disruptions or failures, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities. Our networks and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to these attacks and unauthorized access. In addition, the satellites upon which we rely for current services and will rely for future services are and will be subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions or outages, which have occurred and may occur in the future as a result of various factors, such as satellite design and manufacturing defects, improper maintenance, problems with the power or control systems of the satellites, collisions with space debris and general failures resulting from certain weather conditions or other network impacting issues that may arise when satellites operate in the harsh environment of space. Certain satellites on which we rely or will rely have limited or no operating history. Our satellite network currently includes high throughput satellites, which were first launched in 2017, and may include LEOs and MEOs in the future. Damage to our or third parties networks could cause interruptions in the services that we provide. Such interruptions in our services could have a material adverse effect on service revenue, our reputation and our ability to attract or retain customers. Assertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. We have faced, are currently facing and may in the future face claims that we or a supplier or customer have violated patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Many companies, including our competitors, are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could potentially cover many aspects of our business. In addition, there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet. We have not exhaustively searched patents relevant to our technologies and business and therefore it is possible that we may be unknowingly infringing the patents of others. 31 Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious and whether or not they result in litigation, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our merchandizing or marketing and advertising activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Pursuant to our contracts with our airline partners and certain BA customers, we have agreed to indemnify our airline partners and such customers against such claims, and our indemnification obligations generally include defending or paying for the defense of the action and paying any judgments or other costs assessed against the aviation partner in the event of an adverse outcome. In most cases, our contracts do not cap our indemnification obligations. In addition, certain of our suppliers do not indemnify us for third party infringement or misappropriation claims arising from our use of supplier technology, and we may be liable in the event of such claims. Our inability to meet our indemnification obligations and our airline partners terminating or failing to renew their contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We or our technology suppliers may be unable to continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to consumers, airlines and other aircraft operators. The market for our services is characterized by evolving technology, changes in aviation partner and passenger needs and frequent new service and product introductions. Our success will depend, in part, on our and our suppliers ability to continue to enhance existing technology and services or develop new technology and services for both passenger and aircraft operational use on a timely and cost-effective basis. If we or our suppliers fail to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, aviation partner and passenger requirements and/or regulatory requirements, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We expect to have to invest significant capital to keep pace with innovation and changing technology, and if the amount of such investment exceeds our plans or the amount of investment permitted under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the ABL Credit Agreement, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, the proliferation of new mobile devices and new operating platforms poses challenges for our research and development efforts. If we are unable to create, or obtain rights to, cost effective solutions for a particular device or operating platform, we will be unable to effectively attract users of these devices or operating platforms and our business may be materially adversely affected. As is common in industries like ours, changing technology may result in obsolescence as we implement new technologies and products and retire old technologies and products. As we encounter such obsolescence, we need to ensure that we have a sufficient supply of parts, products and equipment compatible with our existing technology, as well as access to maintenance, repair and other critical support services, until the transition is completed. Certain suppliers may determine to stop manufacturing and supplying end-of-life parts, products and equipment, or may stop providing related services, prior to completion of our transition. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient inventory from existing suppliers we would be required to engage new suppliers who have access to the intellectual property required to manufacture and support components that meet our specifications, and we may not be able to contract with such suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We have implemented policies and procedures intended to ensure that we timely anticipate technology and product transitions and have access to sufficient inventory and services, but if such policies prove ineffective and we are unable to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business to effect a transition, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, following our retirement of end-of-life technologies and products, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand and might have to write off unusable inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 32 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, airline partners, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought and obtained patent protection for certain of our technologies in the United States and certain other countries. Many of the trademarks that we use (including marks we have applied to register) contain words or terms having a somewhat common usage, such as Gogo and Gogo Vision and, as a result, we may have difficulty registering them in certain jurisdictions. We do not own, for example, the domain www.gogo.com and we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we do business or may do business in the future, including China and India. If other companies have registered or have been using in commerce similar trademarks for services similar to ours in foreign jurisdictions, we may have difficulty in registering, or enforcing an exclusive right to use, our marks in those foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be effective, that any patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not obtain intellectual property rights to similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Furthermore, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries in which our service is or may in the future be offered may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our ability to exploit our proprietary technology or our brand image may be harmed, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our use of open source software could limit our ability to commercialize our technology. Open source software is software made widely and freely available to the public in human-readable source code form, usually with liberal rights to modify and improve such software. Some open source licenses require as a condition of use that proprietary software that is combined with licensed open source software and distributed must be released to the public in source code form and under the terms of the open source license. Accordingly, depending on the manner in which such licenses were interpreted and applied, we could face restrictions on our ability to commercialize certain of our products and we could be required to: (i) release the source code of certain of our proprietary software to the public, including competitors, if the open source software was linked to in a manner that would require such release of our proprietary software source code; (ii) seek licenses from third parties for replacement software; and/or (iii) re-engineer our software in order to continue offering our products. Such consequences may materially adversely affect our business. The failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation, result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages, and impair our ability to sell our service. Our products contain complex systems, components and software that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology or when new software is first introduced or new versions or enhancements are released. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. In addition, such events could result in significant expenses and diversion of development and other resources, a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our products and services, loss of existing customers, terminations of, failures to renew, penalties or damage claims under aviation partner contracts, harm to our reputation and brand image and increased insurance costs. If our in-flight system has a malfunction resulting from an error or defect or a problem with installation or maintenance and such malfunction causes physical damage to an aircraft or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could 33 expose us to substantial personal injury claims, product liability claims or costly repair obligations. The aircraft operated by our aviation partners may be very costly to repair and the damages in any product liability claims could be material. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we indemnify most of our airline partners for losses due to third-party claims and in certain cases the causes of such losses may include failure of our products. Should we be required by the FAA or otherwise to cease providing the Gogo service, even on a temporary basis, as a result of a product malfunction or defect, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be materially adversely affected. Regulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. We are subject to various regulations, including those regulations promulgated by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies and comparable agencies outside the United States where we may do business. The two U.S. government agencies that have primary regulatory authority over our operations are the FCC and the FAA. The FCC regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us and the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale and interconnection of wireless telecommunications systems. Any breach of the terms of our ATG spectrum licenses or other licenses and authorizations obtained by us from time to time, or any violation of the Communications Act or the FCCs rules, could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of a license or the imposition of fines. From time to time, the FCC may monitor or audit compliance with the Communications Act and the FCCs rules or with our licenses, including if a third party were to bring a claim of breach or noncompliance. In addition, the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, may be amended in the future in a manner that could be adverse to us. The commercial and private aviation industries, including civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries, are highly regulated in the United States by the FAA. FAA certification is required for all equipment we install on commercial aircraft and type certificated business aircraft, and certain of our operating activities require that we obtain FAA certification as a parts manufacturer. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled BusinessLicenses and RegulationFederal Aviation Administration, FAA approvals required to operate our business include STCs and Parts Manufacturing Authority (PMA). Obtaining STCs and PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. Prior to installation of our equipment, any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining (including as a result of a government shutdown or funding shortages), or change in, needed FAA certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our installation commitments, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business. Following installation of our equipment, if we were to discover that our equipment or components of our equipment were not in compliance with specifications on which the STC authorizing installation was based, or if the FAAs requirements changed, our non-compliance could result in our incurring material costs to inspect and in some circumstances modify or replace such equipment, and could in rare circumstances result in our system being turned off or installed aircraft being grounded. Our failure to comply with FAA regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The FAA closely regulates many of our operations. If we fail to comply with the FAAs many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the FAA certifications, authorizations, or other approvals on which our manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alteration capabilities are based. In addition, from time to time, the FAA or comparable foreign agencies adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. The FAA could also change its policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies, which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, our compliance costs would likely increase. 34 We are required to contribute a percentage of all revenue generated from interstate or international telecommunications services or interconnected VoIP services, which we offer in the BA segment, to the federal Universal Service Fund, which subsidizes telecommunications services in areas that are expensive to serve. Broadband Internet access services are currently exempt from these USF contribution requirements. As a broadband Internet provider, we must comply with CALEA, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Currently, our CALEA solution is fully deployed in our network. However, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC or law enforcement agencies for any delays in complying or failure to comply with, CALEA, or similar obligations. Such enforcement actions could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties, all of which may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, to the extent the FCC adopts additional capability requirements applicable to broadband Internet providers, its decision may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations. We are also subject to regulation by foreign laws and regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which our international airline partners are registered, as well as foreign government agencies that choose to assert jurisdiction over us as a result of the service we provide on aircraft that fly international routes, including Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (formerly Industry Canada), which issued our exclusive Canadian ATG subordinate spectrum license and regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us. Many non-U.S. jurisdictions require us to assist law enforcement by allowing access to our network for surveillance purposes in a manner similar to CALEA. Adverse decisions or regulations of these U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could delay the deployment of our services and have other adverse consequences for us. Our ability to obtain certain regulatory approvals to offer the Gogo service internationally may also be the responsibility of our aviation partners or third parties, and therefore may be out of our control. We are unable to predict the impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business. If government regulation of the Internet changes, including with respect to e-commerce or online video distribution, we may need to change the way we conduct our business to a manner that incurs greater operating expenses, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The current legal environment for Internet communications, products and services is uncertain and subject to statutory, regulatory or interpretive change. We cannot be certain that we, our vendors and media partners or our aviation customers are currently in compliance with applicable regulatory or other legal requirements in the countries in which our service is used. Regulators may disagree with our interpretations of laws or regulations or the applicability of laws or regulations to our business, and existing laws, regulations and interpretations may change in unexpected ways. Our failure, or the failure of our vendors and media partners, customers and others with whom we transact business to comply with existing or future legal or regulatory requirements may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If our efforts to retain and attract passenger users are not successful, our revenue will be adversely affected. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Gogo service we provide on commercial aircraft generated approximately 53%, 49% and 64% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We must continue to retain existing users and attract new users. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 35 Unreliable service levels, lack of sufficient capacity, the scope and nature of our service offerings, uncompetitive pricing, difficulty or delay in accessing our portal, lack of availability and cybersecurity and privacy risks are some of the factors that may adversely impact our ability to retain existing users and attract new and repeat users. If passengers are able to satisfy their in-flight entertainment needs through activities other than broadband Internet access, at no or lower cost, they may not perceive value in our products and services. If our efforts to satisfy and retain our existing users are not successful, we may not be able to continue to attract new users through word-of-mouth referrals. Any of these factors could slow the growth of our service revenue, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our contract with one airline partner from which we derived a significant portion but less than a majority of our 2019 consolidated revenue allows for termination rights if the percentage of passengers using connectivity aboard the airlines Gogo-equipped flights falls below certain thresholds. The demand for in-flight broadband Internet access service may decrease or develop more slowly than we expect. We cannot predict with certainty the development of the U.S. or international in-flight broadband internet access market or the market acceptance for our products and services. Our future success depends upon growing demand for in-flight broadband Internet access services, which is inherently uncertain. We have invested significant resources in the deployment of new systems and service offerings, which represent a substantial part of our growth strategy. We face the risk that the U.S. and international demand for in-flight broadband Internet access services may decrease or develop more slowly or differently than we currently expect, or that our services, including our new offerings, may not achieve widespread market acceptance. We may be unable to market and sell our services successfully and cost-effectively to a sufficiently large number aviation partners. Our business depends on the continued proliferation of Wi-Fi as a standard feature in mobile devices. The growth in demand for in-flight broadband Internet access services also depends in part on the continued and increased use of laptops, smartphones, tablet computers, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices and the rate of evolution of data-intensive applications on the mobile Internet. If Wi-Fi ceases to be a standard feature in mobile devices, if the rate of integration of Wi-Fi on mobile devices decreases or is slower than expected, or if the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices or development of related applications decreases or grows more slowly than anticipated, the market for our services may be substantially diminished. Our business requires substantial investment and there can be no assurance that such investment will result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Our business requires substantial investment and there can be no assurance that such investment will result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Since our initial public offering (IPO), we have obtained debt financing through our entry into our previous credit facility, issuances of convertible notes and issuances of senior secured notes. Excluding the impact of such financing activities, we have not generated positive cash flows on a consolidated basis, and our ability to do so will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenue and manage costs in each of our three business segments. See the disclosure elsewhere in this Risk Factors section under the heading  We may need additional financing to execute our business plan or new initiatives, which we may not be able to secure on acceptable terms, or at all. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on the continued roll-out of our technology roadmap and international expansion. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to numerous variables and such initiatives may require funding beyond the funding we currently expect and/or the funding we can secure. Such variables include, for our technology roadmap, the availability of and costs associated with development and deployment of Gogo 5G, our next generation ATG solution, the timely and successful installation of our equipment, and the timing of the deployment of other technologies in the future, as well as costs incurred to develop and implement changes to ground and airborne software and hardware, costs associated with subsidizing our airline partners equipment purchases, including upgrades to ATG-4, 2Ku or other contractually obligated upgrades to our connectivity services and, with respect to satellite technologies, the cost of obtaining satellite capacity. With respect to our 36 international expansion, additional variables may include costs incurred to modify our portal for international deployment, costs related to sales and marketing activities and administrative support functions, additional legal and regulatory expenses associated with operating in the international commercial aviation market, costs incurred to set up branch offices, subsidiaries or other entities required to do business in certain countries, costs incurred to set up physical foreign offices and employment related costs for individuals located in those countries. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and promote our brand internationally. These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue and overall business, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may need additional financing to execute our business plan or new initiatives and we expect that we will need additional financing to refinance or repay our existing indebtedness at maturity; we may not be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all. As of December 31, 2019, our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $170 million. However, to date, excluding the impact of financing activities, we have not generated positive cash flows on a consolidated basis. As a result, we may require additional financing at some point in the future to fully execute our business plan, including our technology roadmap, international or domestic expansion plans or other changes. Our success may depend on our ability to raise such additional financing on reasonable terms and on a timely basis. The amount and timing of our capital needs will depend in part on the resources required to develop our next generation ATG solution, the extent of deployment of 2Ku and our next generation ATG service, the rate of customer penetration, the adoption of our service by airline partners and other factors set forth above that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may actively consider from time to time other significant technological, strategic and operational initiatives. In order to execute on any of these initiatives, we may require additional financing. Furthermore, we expect that we will require additional financing to refinance, or repay at maturity, our indebtedness, including $237.8 million of 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) that mature on May 15, 2022. Conditions in the economy and the financial markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary additional capital or financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is also limited by the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, as amended, and the ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries would have been able to incur approximately $40 million of additional indebtedness, in the form of capital leases and borrowing under the ABL Credit Agreement. See  Risks Related to our IndebtednessWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all . If we cannot secure sufficient additional financing, we will be forced to forego strategic opportunities or delay, scale back or eliminate additional service deployment, operations and investments or employ unplanned internal cost savings measures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Increased costs and other demands associated with our growth could impact our ability to achieve profitability and could strain our personnel, technology and infrastructure resources. Our costs could increase in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results. We continue to experience growth in our operations, which has placed significant demands on our management, administrative, technological, operational and financial infrastructure. Such growth, as well as anticipated future growth, including growth related to the broadening of our service offerings, the wide deployment of 2Ku, the development and implementation of Gogo 5G and other components of the technology roadmap, and continued investment in CA-ROW, have required and will require the outlay of significant operating and capital expenditures and will continue to place strains on our personnel, technology and infrastructure. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to contain these costs and other costs associated with growth opportunities. To successfully manage the expected growth of our operations on a timely and 37 cost-effective basis we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, technological and management processes and controls and our reporting systems and procedures. In addition, as we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate new employees and develop and motivate all employees, and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Adverse economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business. Macro-economic challenges are capable of creating volatile and unpredictable environments for doing business. We cannot predict the nature, extent, timing or likelihood of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of any economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States or in the airline industry. For many travelers, air travel and spending on in-flight Internet access are discretionary purchases that they can eliminate in difficult economic times. Additionally, a weaker business environment could lead to a decrease in overall business travel, which has historically been an important contributor to our service revenue, or cause BA owners and operators of business aircraft to cut costs by reducing their purchases or use of private aircraft. Should an economic slowdown occur in the U.S. or globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our operating results may fluctuate unpredictably and may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors, adversely affecting our stock price. We operate in a dynamic industry and our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to many factors, many of which are not within our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Further, it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenue, margin and operating results, and if we fail to match our expected results or the results expected by financial analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected. In addition, due to generally lower demand for business travel during the summer months and holiday periods, and leisure and other travel at other times during the year, our quarterly results may not be indicative of results for the full year. Due to these and other factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as accurate indicators of our future performance. We may be unsuccessful at evaluating or pursuing strategic opportunities, which could adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition Our Board and management continuously assess whether shareholder value would be increased by engaging in strategic and/or financial relationships, transactions or other opportunities, including those that are suggested to us by third parties. There can be no assurance that we will pursue any strategic or financial relationship, transaction or other opportunity, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Further, the process of evaluating and pursuing any such relationship, transaction or other opportunity will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks relating to assessing and undertaking strategic opportunities, it may disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, operating results and financial condition. Our possession and use of personal information and the use of credit cards by users of our services present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation. In the ordinary course of our business, we or our third-party providers collect, process and store sensitive data, including personal information of aircraft passengers and our employees and credit card information. The 38 secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information (and other sensitive data such as our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers) is critical to our operations and business strategy. We depend on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party providers of telecommunications, cloud computing, customer support and payment processing services, and other vendors. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, hardware or software defects or other disruptions. Further, our in-cabin network operates as an open, unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, and non-encrypted transmissions users send over this network may be vulnerable to access by other users on the same plane. Unauthorized use of our, or our third-party service providers, networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including personal information and credit card information of passengers using our service. Data security threats are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that any security measures we, or third parties, take will be effective in preventing these activities, given the constantly changing nature of the threats. Any such security incidents, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under our contracts with airline partners, which generally require us to indemnify the airline for passenger and other third-party claims arising from data security breaches. In addition, such incidents may disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to protect confidential user data or to provide users with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to investigations and regulatory penalties imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies, non-U.S. regulatory agencies or courts. For example, the FTC could assert jurisdiction to impose penalties if it found our privacy policies or security measures to be inadequate under existing federal law. We could also be subject to certain state laws, including so-called mini-FTC Acts, that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these rules or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also must comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our voice services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. Our failure to comply with these requirements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other countries in which we may operate or from which our services may be offered, including those in the European Union (EU), also have certain privacy and data security requirements that may apply to our business, either now or in the future. These countries laws may in some cases be more stringent than the requirements in the United States. For example, European Union member countries have specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions, including to the United States. In addition, some countries have stricter consumer notice and/or consent requirements relating to personal information collection, use or sharing. Moreover, international privacy and data security regulations have become more complex. In May 2018, the GDPR took effect, which has imposed even more restrictive privacy-related requirements. Despite the substantial preparation and related expenditures that we undertook to be in compliance with the GDPR as of its effective date, there can be no assurance that we are or will continue to be in compliance. The regulation of data privacy and security in the EU and in other jurisdictions continues to evolve, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate effect of evolving regulation and implementation over time. EU member states also have some flexibility to supplement the GDPR with their own laws and regulations and may apply stricter requirements for certain data processing activities. Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, in September 2018, the governor of California signed into law an amended version of the CCPA. The CCPA 39 provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt-out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA will also impose compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including notice, consent, and data retention requirements, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The CCPA was recently amended to, among other things, delay certain of the notice, deletion, and opt-out requirements with respect to employees and contractors, and to data collected in certain business-to-business communications, until January 1, 2021. The California Office of the Attorney General has proposed regulations to implement portions of the CCPA. The California Legislature may consider amendments to the CCPA during this years legislative session. Additionally, an initiative proposing a California Privacy Rights Act, which would amend the CCPA, may be on the November 2020 ballot in California. Depending on the final text of the regulations, any legislative amendments, and the passage of the ballot initiative, the measures we are required to take to comply with the CCPA may be significantly impacted. Our failure to comply with GDPR, CCPA or other privacy or data security-related laws, rules or regulations imposed by U.S. federal or state governments or agencies or foreign governments or agencies could result in material penalties imposed by regulators or cause us to be in material breach under our airline agreements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, substantially all connectivity customers use credit cards to purchase our products and services. Problems with our or our vendors billing software could adversely affect our customer satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment services. If our billing software fails to work properly and, as a result, we do not automatically charge our subscribers credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by major credit card companies, to comply with their data security standards to protect payment card information. New and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs. We cannot be sure that a regulator would deem our security measures to be appropriate given the lack of prescriptive measures in certain data protection laws. Without more specific guidance, we cannot know whether our chosen security safeguards are adequate according to each applicable data protection law. Given the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, we cannot be sure that our chosen security safeguards will protect against security threats to our business. Even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our or our partners information technology systems and the data contained in those systems. Moreover, interpretations or changes to new or existing data protection laws may impose on us responsibility for our employees and third parties that assist with aspects of our data processing. As a result, our employees or third parties intentional, unintentional, or inadvertent actions may increase our vulnerability or expose us to security threats, such as phishing attacks, and we may remain responsible for a successful phishing attack despite the quality and otherwise legal sufficiency of our security measures. We depend upon third parties, many of which are single-source providers, to manufacture equipment components, provide services for our network and install and maintain our equipment. We rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components and services that we use to provide our ATG and satellite services. Many suppliers of critical components of our equipment are single-source providers. Components for which we rely on single-source suppliers include, among others, the antennas and modems for all systems, the radomes for our satellite systems and the equipment used at our ATG cell site base stations. If we are required for any reason (including expiration of the contract, termination by one party for material breach or other termination events) to find one or more alternative suppliers, we estimate that the replacement process 40 could take up to two years depending upon the component, and we may not be able to contract with such alternative suppliers on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Finding and contracting with suppliers of some components may be delayed or made more difficult by current suppliers ownership of key intellectual property that requires alternative suppliers to either obtain rights to such intellectual property or develop new designs that do not infringe on such intellectual property. In addition, many of our components, such as the equipment used in our base stations, are highly integrated with other system components, which may further lengthen the time required for an alternative supplier to deliver a component that meets our system requirements. We also rely on a third party to provide the links between our data centers and our ground network. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In our CA business, installation and maintenance of our airborne ATG and satellite equipment is performed by employees of third-party service providers with whom we contract, and in some cases, by our airline partners, third-party service providers with whom the airline partners contract, or OEMs. In our BA segment, installation of our equipment is performed by the OEMs or dealers who purchase our equipment. Having third parties or our customers install or maintain our equipment reduces our control over the processes, including timeliness and quality. If there is an equipment failure, including due to problems with the installation or maintenance processes, our reputation and our relationships with our customers could be harmed. The passenger jets operated by our airline partners are very costly to repair and therefore damages for claims related to faulty installation or maintenance could be material. Additionally, we may be forced to pay significant remediation costs and/or penalties to airlines to cover equipment failure due to installation or maintenance problems and we may not be able to be indemnified for these costs. The supply of third party components and services could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers or a significant decline in their financial condition. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our agreements with our equipment and service providers may contain terms, such as those related to termination, pricing and service levels and related penalties, that are not consistent with our obligations under our agreements with customers that rely on such equipment for connectivity. Should we breach such customers agreements, we may be unable to seek indemnification for such losses from our providers. Further, if our suppliers were to increase their prices and we could not pass these increased costs on to our customers, it would increase our cost of service, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We depend upon ZTE to provide support services for our existing ATG network. ZTE USA, Inc. (ZTE USA) has historically developed, supplied and supported the base stations and associated core network elements used in our current ATG network, and we continue to rely on it for support services. In April 2018, the U.S. Commerce Departments Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) found that China-based affiliates of ZTE USA (together with ZTE USA, ZTE) had violated a settlement agreement related to sanctions against Iran and North Korea. As a result of that finding, BIS issued a denial order prohibiting ZTE for seven years from participating in any transaction involving certain technology exported from the United States. The prohibited transactions precluded us from, among other things, obtaining support services from ZTE. In July 2018, BIS lifted the denial order. On May 15, 2019, the President signed an Executive Order declaring a national emergency with respect to certain enumerated national security threats, including with respect to technology created or disseminated by 41 foreign adversaries. The Executive Order prohibits any acquisition, importation, transfer, installation, dealing in, or use of any information and communications technology or service (transaction) by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States for certain covered transactions, such as those that pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons. In addition, in November 2019, the FCC adopted a rule that prospectively prohibits the use of universal service fund support to purchase or obtain any equipment or services produced or provided by a covered company posing a national security threat to the integrity of communications networks or the communications supply chain. The FCC initially designated ZTE as a covered company for purposes of this rule. If these or other government actions (including penalties that could be imposed if ZTE again violates the settlement agreement) limit or prohibit ZTEs performance of its obligations under our existing contract, we may be required to contract with a new supplier or suppliers for the services previously provided by ZTE for our existing ATG network. If we are unable to timely identify one or more alternate suppliers adequate to meet our needs and to negotiate commercially reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute our growth strategy. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business. Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries such as ours is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our ATG and satellite networks and related technology and develop and successfully deploy our technology roadmap and new wireless telecommunications products and technology. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. In particular, we have had and may continue to have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly skilled personnel during periods of poor operating performance. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel, including Oakleigh Thorne, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Gogo and its operations. As a result, if any of our key personnel were to leave Gogo, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key employees. In addition, much of our key technology and systems is custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, could disrupt our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Businesses or technologies we acquire could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our ongoing business, dilute stockholder value or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. As part of our business strategy, we may engage in acquisitions of businesses or technologies to augment our organic or internal growth. We do not have any meaningful experience with integrating and managing acquired businesses or assets. Acquisitions involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. Moreover, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities on terms that are acceptable to us. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets or may fail. Any future acquisition could involve numerous risks, including: potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; difficulty integrating the operations and products of the acquired business; 42 use of cash to fund the acquisition or for unanticipated expenses; limited market experience in new businesses; exposure to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies we acquire; additional costs due to differences in culture, geographical locations and duplication of key talent; delays associated with or resources being devoted to regulatory review and approval; acquisition-related accounting charges affecting our balance sheet and operations; difficulty integrating the financial results of the acquired business in our consolidated financial statements; controls in the acquired business; potential impairment of goodwill; dilution to our current stockholders from the issuance of equity securities; and potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company. In the event we enter into any acquisition agreements, closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including antitrust review, or other conditions. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any attempted acquisitions, and we could assume the economic risks of such failed or unsuccessful acquisitions. Difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could have a material effect on our results of operations. The provision of equipment to our airline partners results in significant accounts receivable. In 2019, a significant portion of the service revenue in CA was generated from passenger credit card transactions resulting in credit card accounts receivable, which are typically settled within one to three business days following the charge. Going forward, we expect an increasing portion of our CA services revenue to be billed directly to airline partners operating under the airline-directed model and to third-party distributors of our service. Service and equipment revenues in our BA segment are directly billed to customers. We may not be able to collect our receivables on a timely basis. Difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, as well as longer payment cycles, could lead to material fluctuations in our cash flows, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Expenses or liabilities resulting from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We and several of our airline partners are currently defendants in a patent infringement lawsuit. In addition, we and certain of our current and former executives are defendants in a securities class action lawsuit, and we are a nominal defendant, and members of our board of directors and certain current and former executives are defendants, in a related stockholder derivative lawsuit. We are required to indemnify our airline partner co-defendants in the infringement lawsuits and the directors and current and former officers who are defendants in the class action and derivative lawsuits for their defense costs and any judgments resulting from such suits. In the future, we may be subject to additional securities class action or derivative litigation. From time to time, we may also be subject to other claims or litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including for example, claims related to employment matters. Our operations are characterized by the use of new technologies and services across multiple jurisdictions that implicate various statutes and a range of rules and regulations that may be subject to broad or creative interpretation. This may result in litigation, including class action lawsuits, the outcome of which may be difficult to assess or quantify due to the potential ambiguity inherent in these regulatory schemes and/or the nascence of our technologies and services. Plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain 43 unknown for substantial periods of time. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products and services, or require us to pay significant monetary damages, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce our existing contracts and, even if successful, may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation by or against any airline partner, customer or supplier could have the effect of negatively impacting our reputation and goodwill with existing and potential airline partners, customers and suppliers. Governmental action related to trade with China or other foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The U.S. government has indicated its intent to alter its approach to international trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements and treaties with foreign countries. In addition, the U.S. government has initiated or is considering imposing tariffs on certain foreign goods, and related to this action, certain foreign governments, including China, have instituted or are considering imposing tariffs on certain U.S. goods. It remains unclear what the U.S. government or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact our supply chain and foreign demand for our products and services and, thus, to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We and our subsidiaries have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment. As of December 31, 2019, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $1.2 billion, including $925.0 million outstanding of our 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the 2024 Senior Secured Notes), $237.8 million outstanding of our 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes) and $2.5 million outstanding of our 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Convertible Notes). Subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, as amended, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future, including up to $30.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability (and including letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities) under our asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility) pursuant to the credit agreement, dated as of August 26, 2019 (the ABL Credit Agreement), which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to: a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited, and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness may be impaired in the future; we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and which, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase; our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future; 44 it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness; we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business units. We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all. We have from time to time evaluated, and we continue to evaluate, our potential capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, limitations on bandwidth capacity and generally evolving technology in our industry. We may utilize one or more types of capital raising in order to fund any initiative in this regard, including the issuance of new equity securities and new debt securities, including debt securities convertible into our common stock. Since our IPO, we have obtained debt financing through our entry into our previous credit facility, issuances of convertible notes and issuances of senior secured notes. Excluding the impact of such financing activities, we have not generated positive cash flows on a consolidated basis, and our ability to do so will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenue and manage costs in each of our three business segments. In addition, our ability to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and the timing of certain capital and other necessary expenditures are subject to numerous variables, such as costs related to international expansion and execution of our current technology roadmap, including continuing development of our 2Ku and ATG systems, and other potential future technologies. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes, the ABL Credit Agreement and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited by the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, the remaining permitted indebtedness for Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and its subsidiaries was approximately $40 million in the form of capital leases and borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement. In the future, if our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and in the ABL Credit Agreement, our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. Neither the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes nor the ABL Credit Agreement prohibits Gogo Inc. from incurring additional indebtedness under any circumstances, but they do limit the amount of cash that our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to us to pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes or to pay interest on other indebtedness incurred by us, including indebtedness or preferred stock incurred to refinance, replace, renew or refund the 2022 Convertible Notes. The terms of any additional financing may further limit our financial and operating flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use the proceeds from any such financing to repay a portion of our outstanding debt. 45 If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and we may grant holders of such securities rights with respect to the governance and operations of our business. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on desirable terms or at all, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could result in a default on existing indebtedness or future indebtedness. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements and instruments governing our debt. In addition, we do not currently have a revolving credit facility under which we can borrow to make payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance any indebtedness. In the absence of such sources of capital, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement restrict our ability to dispose of assets and how we use the proceeds from any such dispositions. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to consummate those dispositions or, if we do, what the timing of the dispositions will be or whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet our debt service obligations when due. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, us to: incur additional debt; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make certain investments; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate with other companies; and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement may be affected by economic, financial and industry 46 conditions beyond our control. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such agreements and instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, may limit our ability in the future to satisfy currently outstanding obligations and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Additionally, any indebtedness under our ABL Credit Agreement will bear interest at variable rates that use the London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the FCA Announcement). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis may not be assured after 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark. Recent proposals for LIBOR reforms may result in the establishment of new methods of calculating LIBOR or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates. The expected phase out of LIBOR could cause market volatility or disruption and may adversely affect our access to the capital markets and cost of funding. Furthermore, while the ABL Credit Agreement contains provisions providing for use of alternative rate calculations in the event LIBOR is unavailable, these provisions may not adequately address the actual changes to LIBOR or successor rates. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes, and any indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility, are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our secured indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes, and any indebtedness under the ABL Credit Facility, are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, if an event of default were to occur under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement, the holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent amounts were outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility, the lenders party to the ABL Credit Agreement would have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations under the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility. We may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes, to repay the 2022 Convertible Notes at maturity or to purchase the 2022 Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement may limit our ability to pay interest, or dividends, on indebtedness, or preferred stock, issued to refinance the 2022 Convertible Notes. Holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their 2022 Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. In addition, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2022 47 Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the 2022 Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2022 Convertible Notes being converted, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share). Moreover, we will be required to repay the 2022 Convertible Notes in cash on May 15, 2022, their maturity date, unless earlier converted or repurchased. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of 2022 Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or repay the 2022 Convertible Notes at maturity or upon 2022 Convertible Notes being converted. The indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement also does not allow our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us for the payment of the principal of the 2022 Convertible Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement limits the amount of cash our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes or to pay any interest on other indebtedness incurred by us, including indebtedness or preferred stock incurred to refinance, replace, renew or refund the 2022 Convertible Notes, which may limit our ability to issue debt or other securities in an amount necessary to refinance the outstanding 2022 Convertible Notes or at rates that such distributions could support. While we have reserved a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes to fund a portion of future interest payments on the 2022 Convertible Notes, the amount of such funds, together with funds up-streamed from subsidiaries and from other potential sources of liquidity (if any) may not be adequate to fund any future liquidity shortfall. See  We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all . Our failure to purchase 2022 Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes or to pay cash payable upon future conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes as required by the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes. A default under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the agreements and instruments governing our other indebtedness and the acceleration of amounts outstanding thereunder, including the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the 2022 Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. A default under the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. The change of control repurchase feature of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes, as well as certain restrictions contained in the ABL Credit Agreement, may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company. The terms of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the 2022 Convertible Notes, respectively, in the event of a change of control. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2022 Convertible Notes to require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the 2022 Convertible Notes, respectively. In addition, under the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, a takeover of our company would allow the administrative agent and/or the lenders to terminate their commitments under the ABL Credit Agreement and declare any and all outstanding amounts to be due and payable. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us, our subsidiaries or our indebtedness, if any, could cause our cost of capital to increase. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes have been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any 48 given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agencys judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline. The trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our IPO, which occurred on June 21, 2013 and in which shares of common stock were sold at a price of $17.00 per share. From the IPO date through March 1, 2020, the price of our common stock has ranged from a closing low of $2.93 per share to a closing high of $34.34 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include: airline industry or general market conditions, including those related to the impact of COVID-19 on restrictions on and demand for air travel, as well as disruptions to supply chains and installations; domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; changes in technology or customer usage of Wi-Fi and Internet broadband services; any inability to timely and efficiently roll out Gogo 5G or any next generation ATG technology or other components of our technology roadmap; any inability to sufficiently execute our international growth strategy; uncertainties and consequences arising from the United Kingdoms departure from the European Union, including any financial, trade, tax and legal implications any inability to obtain satellite service on commercially reasonable terms or at all, currently and in the future; new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and any inability to generate positive cash flows on a consolidated basis in the future or to obtain additional financing; changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance; changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts; action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales; short-selling or other transactions involving derivatives of our securities; speculation in the press or investment community; investor perception of us and our industry; changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies; announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, contract amendments, acquisitions or strategic partnerships; developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including increases or decreases in litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants; failure to complete significant sales; 49 any future sales of our common stock or other securities; renewal of our FCC license and our ability to obtain additional spectrum; and additions or departures of key personnel. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many such companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adjustments by holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes of their hedging positions in our common stock and the forward stock purchase transactions, or any modifications of the forward stock purchase transactions, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Any buying or selling of shares of our common stock by holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes to establish or adjust hedged positions with respect to our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2022 Convertible Notes may also encourage short selling by market participants because any conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes could depress our common stock price. The price of our common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the 2022 Convertible Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation, and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity, which we expect to occur involving our common stock. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated privately negotiated prepaid forward stock purchase transaction (the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the Forward Counterparty), which replaced the prepaid forward stock purchase transaction entered into with the Forward Counterparty in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The Amended and Restated Forward Transaction is generally expected to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions, including swaps, between the Forward Counterparty and investors in the 2022 Convertible Notes relating to shares of our common stock by which investors in the 2022 Convertible Notes will establish short positions relating to shares of our common stock and otherwise hedge their investments in the 2022 Convertible Notes. The maturity date of such Amended and Restated Forward Transaction is on or around May 15, 2022, the maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. Such investors may enter into other transactions in connection with or in addition to such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of shares of our common stock. As a result of the existence of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction, such derivative transactions and any related market activity could cause more purchases or sales of shares of our common stock over the term of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction than there otherwise would have been had we not entered into the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. Such purchases or sales, including sales made in connection with any refinancing or repurchase of our 2022 Convertible Notes, could potentially increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. In addition, in connection with any repurchase of our 2022 Convertible Notes, the Forward Counterparty may elect to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction early in accordance with its terms, which would result in a delivery of shares of our common stock to us earlier than the maturity date described above. In addition, we may request that the Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include 50 block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ), sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request for the Forward Counterparty to effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the Forward Counterparty on such terms as we may agree with the Forward Counterparty at the time. Additionally, the Forward Counterparty (or its affiliates) is likely to modify its hedge positions in respect of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock and/or by purchasing the shares of common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction (and are likely to do so during the final valuation period under the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction and on or around any election by the Forward Counterparty to settle all of a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction early). The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock. The Forward Counterparty is a financial institution, and we will be subject to the risk that it might default under the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Forward Counterparty is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the Forward Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the Forward Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by the Forward Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. Conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of the 2022 Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the 2022 Convertible Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2022 Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Future stock issuances could cause substantial dilution and a decline in our stock price. We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangement, as consideration to third party service or equipment providers or otherwise. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and other equity incentives and the conversion of 2022 Convertible Notes. We may reserve additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or other similar forms of equity incentives. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. 51 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If securities or industry analysts covering Gogo downgrade our stock or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Our President and CEO is a significant stockholder and could exert influence over our company, and if the ownership of our common stock continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. As of December 31, 2019, Oakleigh Thorne, our President and CEO and a member of our Board of Directors, and the entities affiliated with Mr. Thorne (the Thorne Entities) beneficially owned nearly 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Thorne is able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including approval of significant corporate transactions and the election of directors. Such ability to influence may reduce the market price of our common stock. As our President and CEO, Mr. Thorne has control over our day-to-day management and the implementation of major strategic initiatives and investments by our company, subject to authorization and oversight by our Board of Directors. As a member of our Board of Directors, Mr. Thorne owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Thorne is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interest, which may not always be in the interests of stockholders generally. Our corporate governance guidelines address potential conflicts between a directors interests and our interests, and our code of business conduct, among other things, requires our employees and directors to avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with their job responsibilities or our interests and to disclose their outside activities, financial interests or relationships that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict to management or corporate counsel. These corporate governance guidelines and code of business ethics do not, by themselves, prohibit transactions with the Thorne Entities. Fulfilling our obligations associated with being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley), is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price. As a public company, Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as NASDAQ rules, require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public company obligations requires us to devote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. Our business is complex and the accounting treatment for airline equipment and services transactions may vary depending on the business model that an airline selects. Ensuring that our business processes and systems evolve with the changing needs of the business creates challenges which may increase the risks we encounter in meeting our financial reporting obligations. We have hired additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company reporting experience and technical accounting knowledge. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increased auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. 52 We are required under Sarbanes-Oxley to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation or the implementation of our financial system upgrade, may materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ, or other regulatory authorities. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, and certain provisions in our existing and any future credit facility could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include: Authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt; Establishment of a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which our board will be divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting; A requirement that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote; A provision that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; A limitation on who may call special meetings of stockholders; A prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and A requirement of supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. These provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and growth of our business, and we do not expect to declare and pay any 53 dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, to the extent that we determine to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Furthermore, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership by non-U.S. citizens, including the power of our Board of Directors to redeem shares of our common stock from non-U.S. citizens. The Communications Act and FCC regulations impose restrictions on foreign ownership of FCC licensees, as described in the above risk factor,  Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property and RegulationIf we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license . Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions that permit our Board of Directors to take certain actions in order to comply with FCC regulations regarding foreign ownership, including but not limited to, a right to redeem shares of common stock from non-U.S. citizens at prices at or below fair market value. Non-U.S. citizens should consider carefully the redemption provisions in our certificate of incorporation prior to investing in our common stock. These restrictions may also decrease the liquidity and value of our stock by reducing the pool of potential investors in our company and making the acquisition of control of us by third parties more difficult. In addition, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to attract equity financing or consummate an acquisition of a foreign entity using shares of our capital stock. Regulations related to conflict minerals force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex. We are subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which requires us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of certain of the materials used in the manufacture of components in our products and equipment. In addition, we have and will continue to incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Properties Currently, we lease approximately 260,000 square feet for our CA business and corporate headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, under a lease agreement that expires in 2030, which was recently amended to reduce the square footage of the leased property to approximately 150,000 square feet beginning in 2021. We also lease approximately 26,000 square feet for our CA manufacturing facility in Bensenville, Illinois under a lease agreement that expires in 2021. Additionally, our lease for our BA business in Broomfield, Colorado is for approximately 120,000 square feet and expires in 2029. We believe our facilities will be adequate for the foreseeable future. 54 Legal Proceedings Linksmart Litigation On April 20, 2018, Linksmart Wireless Technology, LLC filed suit against us and eight of our airline partners in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that our redirection server and login portal infringe a patent owned by the plaintiff. The suits seek an unspecified amount of damages. We are required under our contracts with these airlines to indemnify them for defense costs and any liabilities resulting from the suit. The Court has stayed the suits against our airline customers pending resolution of the suit against Gogo. Linksmart has also filed suit against other defendants asserting the same patent. Following the filing by one of those defendants of a petition to commence an inter partes review against the asserted patent in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Court stayed the litigation against such other defendant and Gogo, but such stay was lifted in July 2019 when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the petitioner had not met the standard of proof required to commence the inter partes review. We believe that the plaintiffs claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. The outcome of this litigation is inherently uncertain. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Securities Litigation On June 27, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division styled Pierrelouis v. Gogo Inc., naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation as defendants purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our securities from February 27, 2017 through May 4, 2018. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, alleging misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to our 2Ku antennas reliability and installation and remediation costs. The plaintiffs seek to recover from us and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages. In December 2018 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and in February 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss such amended complaint. In October 2019 the judge granted the motion to dismiss on two independent grounds, finding that plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that defendants made materially false or misleading statements and that plaintiffs failed to plead with particularity that defendants acted with scienter. The amended complaint was dismissed without prejudice, and in December 2019, defendants filed a second amended complaint. In February 2020 we filed a motion to dismiss such second amended complaint and that motion is pending. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. In accordance with Delaware law, we will indemnify the individual named defendants for their defense costs and any damages they incur in connection with the suit. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors and Officers insurance policy with respect to this suit. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Derivative Litigation On September 25, 2018 and September 26, 2018, two purported stockholders of the Company filed substantively identical derivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, styled Nanduri v. Gogo Inc. and Hutsenpiller v. Gogo Inc., respectively. Both lawsuits were purportedly brought derivatively on behalf of us and name us as a nominal defendant and name as defendants each member of the Companys Board of Directors, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and allege misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to our 2Ku antennas reliability and installation and remediation costs, as well as allegedly excessive bonuses, stock options, and other compensation paid to current Officers and Directors and excessive severance paid to former Officers. The two lawsuits were consolidated and are stayed until a final disposition of the motion to dismiss in the class action suit. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously if the litigation resumes. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on our behalf, an unspecified amount of damages from the individual defendants. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors and Officers insurance policy with respect to these suits. No amounts have been accrued for any 55 potential costs under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential costs. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material adverse impact on our company due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted, which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as damages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 56 Part II Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information for Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol GOGO since June 21, 2013. Holders of Record As of March 9, 2020, there were 49 stockholders of record of our common stock, and the closing price of our common stock was $2.83 per share as reported on the NASDAQ. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. Repurchases of Equity Securities None. Recent Sale of Unregistered Securities None. Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities None. Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans See Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters for information regarding securities authorized for issuance. Performance This performance graph shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Gogo Inc. under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or the Exchange Act. 57 The following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total return for our common stock, the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index (S&P 500) and the Nasdaq Composite Index (NASDAQ Composite) for the period from December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2019, the last trading day of 2019. The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the market close on December 31, 2014 in our common stock, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite and assumes reinvestments of dividends, if any. The comparisons in the graph below are based upon historical data and are not indicative of, nor intended to forecast, future performance of our common stock. 58 Selected Financial Data The following tables present selected historical financial data as of and for the periods indicated. You should read this information together with Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data and other financial data for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data and other financial data for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of our results to be expected in any future period. Consolidated Statement of Operations Data: Revenue: Service revenue Equipment revenue (1) Total revenue Total operating expenses (1) (2) Operating income (loss) (2) Other (income) expense: Interest expense (3) Extinguishment of debt Adjustment of deferred financing costs Interest income and other Total other expense Loss before income taxes Income tax provision (benefit) Net loss attributable to common stock Net loss per share attributable to common stockbasic and diluted (4) Weighted average shares used in computing net loss attributable to common stockbasic and diluted (4) 59 Consolidated Balance Sheet Data: Cash and cash equivalents Short-term investments Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments Working capital (5) Total assets (6) Indebtedness and long-term finance leases, net of current portion (7) Total liabilities (6) Total stockholders equity (deficit) 2018 reflects the impact of adoption of ASC 606. The historical financial statements have not been restated and are reported under the revenue accounting standard in effect for those periods. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, for further information. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the post-adoption impact of ASC 606 on equipment shipments, which are now fully recognized upon customer acceptance for airline-directed equipment transactions, and the accounting impact of one of our airline partners transitioning to the airline-directed model. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, for further information. Includes depreciation and amortization expense of $118.8 million, $133.6 million, $145.5 million, $105.6 million and $87.0 million, respectively, for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for further information. The calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 excludes approximately 7.2 million shares that were to be repurchased as a result of the Forward Transactions (as defined below) as of such dates. Between March 5-6, 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us pursuant to the Forward Transactions. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. We define working capital as total current assets less total current liabilities. The increase as of December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increases in inventory. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for further information. 2019 reflects the impact from adoption of ASC 842. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, for further information. Includes deferred financing costs of $24.3 million, $17.1 million, $16.2 million, $16.3 million and $14.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 60 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Our fiscal year ends December 31 and, unless otherwise noted, references to years or fiscal are for fiscal years ended December 31. See Results of Operations. Company Overview Gogo (we, us, our) is the global leader in providing broadband connectivity solutions and wireless in-flight entertainment to the aviation industry. We operate through the following three segments: Commercial Aviation North America, or CA-NA, Commercial Aviation Rest of World, or CA-ROW, and Business Aviation, or BA. Services provided by our CA-NA and CA-ROW businesses include Passenger Connectivity, which allows passengers to connect to the Internet from their personal Wi-Fi-enabled devices; Passenger Entertainment, which offers passengers the opportunity to enjoy a broad selection of in-flight entertainment options on their personal Wi-Fi enabled devices; and Connected Aircraft Services (CAS), which offers airlines connectivity for various operations and currently include, among others, real-time credit card transaction processing, electronic flight bags and real-time weather information. Services are provided by CA-NA on commercial aircraft flying routes that generally begin and end within North America, which for this purpose includes the United States, Canada and Mexico. CA-ROW provides service on commercial aircraft operated by foreign-based commercial airlines and flights outside of North America for North American-based commercial airlines. The routes included in our CA-ROW segment are those that begin and/or end outside of North America (as defined above) on which our international service is provided. BA provides in-flight Internet connectivity and other voice and data communications products and services and sells equipment for in-flight telecommunications to the business aviation market. BA services include Gogo Biz, our in-flight broadband service, Gogo Vision, our in-flight entertainment service, and satellite-based voice and data services through our strategic alliances with satellite companies. Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations We believe that our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that affect the commercial airline and business aviation industries, including trends affecting the travel industry and trends affecting the customer bases that we target, as well as factors that affect wireless Internet service providers and general macroeconomic factors. Key factors that may affect our future performance include: costs associated with the implementation of, and our ability to implement on a timely basis our technology roadmap, upgrades and installation of our ATG-4 and 2Ku technologies, Gogo 5G, any technology to which our ATG or satellite networks evolve and other new technologies (including technological issues and related remediation efforts and failures or delays on the part of antenna and other equipment developers and providers, some of which are single source, or delays in obtaining STCs including as a result of any government shutdown), the potential licensing of additional spectrum, and the improvements to our network and operations as technology changes and we experience increased demand and network capacity constraints, including as a result of airline partners deciding to provide free service to passengers; 61 costs associated with, and our ability to execute, our continued international expansion, including our ability to obtain and comply with foreign telecommunications, aviation and other licenses and approvals necessary for our international operations; our ability to obtain sufficient satellite capacity, including for heavily-trafficked areas, in the United States and internationally; costs of satellite capacity in the United States and internationally, to which we may have to commit well in advance; the pace and extent of adoption of our service for use on domestic and international commercial aircraft by our current and new airline partners and customers; the number of aircraft in service in our markets, including consolidation of the airline industry or changes in fleet size by one or more of our commercial airline partners or BA large-fleet customers; the economic environment and other trends that affect both business and leisure aviation travel, including the impact of COVID-19 on restrictions on and demand for air travel, as well as disruptions to supply chains and installations; the extent of passengers and aviation partners adoption of our products and services, which is affected by, among other things, willingness to pay for the services that we provide, the quality and reliability of our products and services, changes in technology and competition from current competitors and new market entrants; our ability to enter into and maintain long-term connectivity arrangements with airline partners and customers, which depends on numerous factors including the real or perceived availability, quality and price of our services and product offerings as compared to those offered by our competitors; the impact of a change in business models and contract terms on the profitability of our connectivity agreements with airline partners, including as a result of changes in accounting standards; the results of our ongoing discussions with Delta with respect to its transition to free service, which may involve seeking to pursue supplier diversification for Deltas domestic mainline fleet, and our ability to offset the impact of any deinstalled aircraft through increased demand and revenue; our ability to engage suppliers of equipment components and network services on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms; continued demand for connectivity and proliferation of Wi-Fi enabled devices, including smartphones, tablets and laptops; changes in domestic or foreign laws, regulations or policies that affect our business or the business of our customers and suppliers; changes in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting telecommunications services, including those affecting our ability to maintain our licenses for ATG spectrum in the United States, obtain sufficient rights to use additional ATG spectrum and/or other sources of broadband connectivity to deliver our services, expand our service offerings and manage our network; and changes in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting aviation, including, in particular, changes that impact the design of our equipment and our ability to obtain required certifications for our equipment. Recent Developments On March 1, 2020, the 2020 Convertible Notes (defined below) matured in accordance with their terms. Upon maturity, we repaid the remaining $2.5 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in order to satisfy our obligations, and the 2020 Convertible Notes were no longer outstanding as of such date. 62 Between March 5-6, 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of our common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. The approximately 2.1 million shares remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction (as defined below) are expected to be delivered to us in May 2022. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China which has resulted in global travel restrictions and the suspension of certain commercial flights by some of our airline partners, which has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our CA business. In recent weeks, we have seen significantly reduced demand on aircraft operated in the Asia Pacific region as compared to demand levels in January 2020 before COVID-19 affected travel. More recently, demand for both business and leisure airline travel on a global basis has declined significantly due to COVID-19, and airlines are responding by cancelling additional flights, including domestic U.S. flights. All of our U.S. airline partners have announced international and domestic capacity reductions, and in the week in which this report is being filed, we are seeing for the first time reduced demand on domestic U.S. flights as a result of COVID-19. In addition, on March 11, 2020 the President of the United States announced a 30-day suspension of travel from 26 European countries to the U.S. and similar or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions could further materially impact business and leisure airline travel. We expect COVID-19 to continue to have a significant negative impact on CA revenue and are unable to predict how long that impact will continue. To date, we have not seen any impact of COVID-19 on our BA business. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the CA and BA businesses and our financial and operational performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If our airline partners continue to experience significantly reduced demand for passenger traffic for an extended period, our 2020 consolidated results of operations and our liquidity and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. The extent to which the outbreak affects our earnings and liquidity will depend in part on our ability to implement various measures intended to reduce expenses and/or conserve cash. Earnings in CA-ROW may be particularly affected if reduced demand for travel continues, as we provide service in that segment solely via satellite-based systems and satellite capacity and certain other costs are largely fixed. Further, travel and other restrictions adopted in response to COVID-19 may impact our ability to complete installations on certain aircraft and successfully operate our services on aircraft that operate in regions affected by the coronavirus, particularly where travel is restricted. Additionally, our suppliers or other third parties we rely upon to install and maintain our services may experience delays or shortages, which could have an adverse effect on our business prospects and results of operations. Key Business Metrics Our management regularly reviews financial and operating metrics, including the following key operating metrics for the CA-NA, CA-ROW and BA reportable segments, to evaluate the performance of our business and our success in executing our business plan, make decisions regarding resource allocation and corporate strategies, and evaluate forward-looking projections. Commercial Aviation North America Aircraft online (at period end) Satellite ATG Total aircraft equivalents (average during the period) Net annualized average monthly service revenue per aircraft equivalent (net annualized ARPA) (in thousands) 63 Commercial Aviation Rest of World Aircraft online (at period end) Total aircraft equivalents (average during the period) Net annualized ARPA (in thousands) Aircraft online. We define aircraft online as the total number of commercial aircraft on which our equipment is installed and service has been made commercially available as of the last day of each period presented. We assign aircraft to CA-NA or CA-ROW at the time of contract signing as follows: (i) all aircraft operated by North American airlines and under contract for ATG or ATG-4 service are assigned to CA-NA, (ii) all aircraft operated by North American airlines and under a contract for satellite service are assigned to CA-NA or CA-ROW based on whether the routes flown by such aircraft under the contract are anticipated to be predominantly within or outside of North America at the time the contract is signed, and (iii) all aircraft operated by non-North American airlines and under a contract are assigned to CA-ROW. The decline in CA-NAs aircraft online is due to the deinstallation of our equipment from certain American Airlines aircraft during 2018 and the first half of 2019. Aircraft equivalents . We define aircraft equivalents for a segment as the number of commercial aircraft online (as defined above) multiplied by the percentage of flights flown by such aircraft within the scope of that segment, rounded to the nearest whole aircraft and expressed as an average of the month-end figures for each month in the period. This methodology takes into account the fact that during a particular period certain aircraft may fly routes outside the scope of the segment to which they are assigned for purposes of the calculation of aircraft online. The decline in CA-NAs aircraft equivalents is due to the deinstallation of our equipment from certain American Airlines aircraft during 2018 and the first half of 2019. Net annualized average monthly service revenue per aircraft equivalent (ARPA). We define net annualized ARPA as the aggregate service revenue plus monthly service fees, some of which are reported as a reduction to cost of service revenue for that segment for the period, less revenue share expense and other transactional expenses which are included in cost of service revenue for that segment, divided by the number of months in the period, and further divided by the number of aircraft equivalents (as defined above) for that segment during the period, which is then annualized and rounded to the nearest thousand. Business Aviation Aircraft online (at period end) Satellite ATG Average monthly service revenue per aircraft online Satellite ATG Units sold Satellite ATG Average equipment revenue per unit sold (in thousands) Satellite ATG 64 Satellite aircraft online . We define satellite aircraft online as the total number of business aircraft for which we provide satellite services as of the last day of each period presented. ATG aircraft online. We define ATG aircraft online as the total number of business aircraft for which we provide ATG services as of the last day of each period presented. Average monthly service revenue per satellite aircraft online . We define average monthly service revenue per satellite aircraft online as the aggregate satellite service revenue for the period divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the number of satellite aircraft online during the period (expressed as an average of the month end figures for each month in such period). Average monthly service revenue per ATG aircraft online. We define average monthly service revenue per ATG aircraft online as the aggregate ATG service revenue for the period divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the number of ATG aircraft online during the period (expressed as an average of the month end figures for each month in such period). Units sold . We define units sold as the number of satellite or ATG units for which we recognized revenue during the period. Average equipment revenue per satellite unit sold . We define average equipment revenue per satellite unit sold as the aggregate equipment revenue earned from all satellite units sold during the period, divided by the number of satellite units sold. Average equipment revenue per ATG unit sold. We define average equipment revenue per ATG unit sold as the aggregate equipment revenue from all ATG units sold during the period, divided by the number of ATG units sold. Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations The following briefly describes certain key components of revenue and expenses for the CA-NA, BA and CA-ROW segments, as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Revenue: We generate two types of revenue through each of our operating segments: service revenue and equipment revenue. For CA-NA and CA-ROW, pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we place our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines in order to deliver our service to passengers on the aircraft. We currently have two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. Under the airline-directed model, we have transferred control of the equipment to the airline and therefore the airline is our customer in these transactions. Under the turnkey model, while our airline partner generally has legal title to our equipment, we do not transfer control of our equipment to our airline partner and, as a result, the airline passenger is deemed to be our customer. Transactions with our airline partners under the turnkey model are accounted for as an operating lease of space on an aircraft. CA-NA and CA-ROW Service Revenue: CA-NA and CA-ROW revenue consists of service revenue primarily derived from connectivity services and, to a lesser extent, from entertainment services and CAS. Connectivity is provided to our customers using both our ATG and satellite technologies. 65 Airline-directed connectivity revenue : As noted above, under the airline-directed model, the airline is our customer and we earn service revenue as connectivity services are consumed directly by the airline or indirectly by passengers. Turnkey connectivity revenue (passenger connectivity) : Under the turnkey model, passenger connectivity revenue is generated by services paid for by passengers, airlines and third parties. Passenger paid revenue represents point-of-sale sessions (which may be flight-based, time-based, multiple individual session packages (multi-pack) or subscriptions). Flight-based, time-based and multi-pack revenue is recognized when the sessions are used. Subscription revenue is recognized evenly throughout the subscription period, regardless of the number of times the customer uses the network. Third party and airline-paid revenue is generated by sales of connectivity services to airlines or third parties in sponsorship, wholesale, enterprise and roaming arrangements. Sponsorship revenue is recognized over the sponsorship term. Revenue from wholesale, enterprise and roaming arrangements is recognized as sessions are used by the passenger. Entertainment revenue: Entertainment revenue consists of entertainment services we provide to the airline for use by its passengers. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the airline. CAS revenue: CAS revenue includes, among other things, real-time credit card transaction processing, electronic flight bags and real-time weather information. Revenue is recognized as the service is provided. BA Service Revenue: BA service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Equipment Revenue: Equipment revenue primarily consists of the sale of ATG and satellite connectivity equipment and the sale of entertainment equipment. CA-NA and CA-ROW recognize equipment revenue upon acceptance by our airline customers. BA primarily recognizes equipment revenue when the equipment is shipped to OEMs and dealers. Equipment revenue also includes revenue generated by our installation of the connectivity or entertainment equipment on commercial aircraft, which is recognized when the installation is complete. Cost of Service Revenue: Commercial Aviation North America and Rest of World: Cost of service revenue for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments includes network related expenses (ATG and satellite network expenses, including costs for transponder capacity and backhaul, as well as data centers, network operations center and network technical support), aircraft operations, component assembly, portal maintenance, revenue share and transactional costs. 66 Revenue share for CA-NA and CA-ROW consists of payments made to our airline partners under our connectivity agreements. Under the turnkey model, our airline partners make an upfront payment for our equipment and take legal title to such equipment. These upfront payments are accounted for as deferred airborne lease incentives and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of cost of service revenue over the term of the agreement. Additionally, monthly service fees we receive from our airline partners under the turnkey model are accounted for as a reduction to our cost of service revenue. CA-NA and CA-ROW transactional costs include billing costs and transaction fees incurred internally and charged by third-party service providers. Business Aviation: Cost of service revenue for the BA segment consists of satellite provider service costs, transaction costs and costs related to network operations. Beginning in January 2019, the BA segment assumed responsibility for operating and maintaining our ATG network and was allocated the majority of the 2019 ATG network costs. In 2020, we adopted a new allocation methodology for the ATG network costs utilizing aircraft online, pricing and usage for each of CA-NA and BA. Under this new methodology, we expect that BA will continue to be allocated the majority of the ATG network costs. Cost of Equipment Revenue: Our cost of equipment revenue primarily consists of the purchase costs for component parts used in the manufacture of our equipment and the production, installation, technical support and quality assurance costs associated with the equipment sales. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses include the costs to design and develop next generation technologies and to obtain and maintain FAA and other regulatory certifications. This includes the development of ground and airborne systems, including customization of network and airborne equipment, along with the design of airborne system installation processes. Engineering, design and development expenses also include costs associated with the enhancement of existing products. Upon adoption of the revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, certification and other regulatory costs directly attributable to our new airline-directed customers are capitalized and amortized over the life of the contract. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Commercial Aviation North America and Rest of World: Sales and marketing expenses for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments consist primarily of costs associated with cultivating our relationships with our airline customers and airline partners and attracting additional passengers as our customers. Sales and marketing activities related to the airlines include contracting with new airlines to offer our service on their aircraft, contracting to add additional aircraft operated by our existing airline partners to the installed fleet, joint marketing of our service with our airline partners and airline customers, program management related service launches and trade shows. Sales and marketing activities related to passengers include advertising and marketing campaigns and promotions as well as customer service related activities and product management. 67 Business Aviation: Sales and marketing expenses for the BA segment consist of costs associated with activities related to customer sales (including sales commissions), digital marketing and lead generation, advertising and promotions, product management, trade shows and customer service support related activities to end users. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses include staff and related operating costs of the business support functions, including finance and accounting, legal, human resources, administrative, information technology, facilities and executive groups. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation expense for both the CA-NA and BA segments includes depreciation expense associated with our office equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements. Additionally, depreciation expense for the CA-NA segment includes depreciation of our airborne equipment for the turnkey model and ground network-related equipment. Depreciation expense for CA-ROW primarily includes depreciation of our airborne equipment for the turnkey model and satellite network-related equipment. We depreciate these assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives that range from three to 25 years, depending on the assets being depreciated. Amortization expense includes the amortization of our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives that range from three to ten years, depending on the assets being amortized. Reportable Segment Profit (Loss) We measure our reportable segments performance on the basis of reportable segment profit (loss), which is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to common stock before unallocated corporate costs, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain non-cash charges (including amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives, stock compensation expense, amortization of STC costs, loss on extinguishment of debt and the accounting impact of the transition to the airline-directed model) and other income (expense). During the fourth quarter of 2019, we revised the presentation of our reportable segments operating results in order to exclude the impact of certain corporate costs from the calculation of total reportable segment profit (loss). All amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. This change is intended to provide better visibility to the profitability of our reportable segments by excluding the costs of broad corporate functions that are not directly attributable to the reportable segments (including executive, legal, finance and human resources). Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related exposures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In some instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances results could differ significantly from our estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. 68 We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies to which many of these critical estimates relate, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, long-lived assets and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Revenue Recognition: We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Our CA-NA and CA-ROW airline-directed contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which primarily include the sale of equipment, installation services, connectivity services and entertainment services. For these contracts, we account for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocate the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which is based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer, if available. To the extent a good or service is not sold separately, we use our best estimate of the standalone selling price and maximize the use of observable inputs. The primary method we use to estimate the standalone selling price is the expected cost-plus margin approach. The contractual consideration used for allocation purposes includes connectivity and entertainment services, which may be based on a fixed monthly fee per aircraft or a variable fee based on the volume of connectivity activity, or a combination of both. Examples of variable consideration within our contracts include megabyte overages and pay-per-use sessions. We constrain our estimates to reduce the probability of a significant revenue reversal in future periods, allocate variable consideration to the identified performance obligations and recognize revenue in the period the services are provided. Our estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated future performance, market conditions and our best judgment at the time. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect our estimated contract value. For example, estimates of variable revenue within certain contracts require estimation of the number of sessions or megabytes that will be purchased over the contract term and the average revenue per connectivity session, which varies based on the connectivity options available to passengers on each airline. Estimated revenue under these contracts anticipates increases in take rates over time and assumes an average revenue per session consistent with our historical experience. Our estimated contract revenue may differ significantly from our initial estimates to the extent actual take rates and average revenue per session differ from our historical experience. We regularly review and update our estimates and recognize adjustments under the cumulative catch-up method. Any adjustments under this method are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period identified and revenue for future periods is recognized using the new adjusted estimate. See Note 4, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. Long-Lived Assets: Our long-lived assets (other than goodwill and indefinite-lived assets which are separately tested for impairment) are evaluated for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Within the Commercial Aviation segment, certain certification and installation programs 69 under some of our turnkey airline contracts are still in progress. Accordingly, we evaluate whether an indication of impairment exists for turnkey airline contracts based on our projected future cash flows associated with such contracts. When an indication of impairment exists, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets with the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. If the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, we then calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss is calculated by comparing the long-lived assets carrying value with its estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future discounted cash flows. We would recognize an impairment loss by the amount the long-lived assets carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted balance becomes the new cost basis and is depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of the asset. We also periodically reassess the useful lives of our long-lived assets due to advances and changes in our technologies. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and long-lived asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the long-lived assets and selecting discount rates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the nature of the estimates or assumptions used to evaluate whether an indication of impairment of long-lived assets exists. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions used, we could experience an impairment triggering event and be exposed to losses that could be material. Stock-Based Compensation Expense: We account for stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award. We recognize this cost as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of stock options. Critical inputs into the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include: the annualized volatility of our common stock; the expected term of the option in years; the grant date fair value of our common stock; the option exercise price; the risk-free interest rate; and the annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock, which are estimated as follows: Volatility. We have not been a public company long enough to calculate volatility based exclusively on our own common stock. Therefore, the expected volatility is calculated as of each grant date based on a weighting of our own common stock and reported data for a peer group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. While we are not aware of any news or disclosure by our peers that may impact their respective volatilities, there is a risk that peer group volatility may increase, thereby increasing the future compensation expense resulting from future option grants. Beginning in 2020, we will calculate volatility based exclusively on our own common stock. Expected Term. The expected term of the stock options is determined based upon the simplified approach, allowed under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, which assumes that the stock options will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. As we obtain data associated with future exercises, the expected term of future grants will be adjusted accordingly. Fair Value of Our Common Stock. The fair value of our common stock underlying the stock options and other stock-based awards was valued by reference to the publicly traded closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Option Exercise Price. The option exercise price was determined based on the publicly traded closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. 70 Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards previously granted. The inputs that create the most sensitivity in our option valuation are the volatility and expected term. See Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our consolidated statements of operations. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Consolidated Statements of Operations Data (in thousands) Revenue: Service revenue Equipment revenue Total revenue Operating expenses: Cost of service revenue (exclusive of items shown below) Cost of equipment revenue (exclusive of items shown below) Engineering, design and development Sales and marketing General and administrative Depreciation and amortization Total operating expenses Operating income (loss) Other (income) expense: Interest income Interest expense Loss on extinguishment of debt Other (income) expense Total other expense Loss before incomes taxes Income tax provision (benefit) Net loss 71 Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 Revenue: Revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Service Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Service Revenue Equipment Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Equipment Revenue Total Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Revenue Commercial Aviation North America: CA-NA revenue decreased to $378.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $469.2 million for the prior year, due to decreases in both equipment and service revenue. Equipment revenue decreased to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $101.8 million for the prior year, due to fewer 2Ku installations, a shift in mix from airline-directed to turnkey installations and the transition to the airline-directed model by one airline in January 2018, which increased equipment revenue by approximately $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. A summary of the components of CA-NAs service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Passenger Connectivity revenue (1) Passenger Entertainment and CAS revenue Total service revenue Includes non-session related revenue of $12.6 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 72 CA-NA service revenue decreased to $354.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $367.4 million for the prior year, due to a decrease in Connectivity revenue, offset in part by an increase in Entertainment and CAS revenue. CA-NA Connectivity revenue decreased to $322.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $339.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to the deinstallation of Gogo equipment from certain American Airlines aircraft during 2018 and the first half of 2019 and the full impact of American Airlines switching to the airline-directed model, offset in part by an increase in passenger-paid and airline-paid revenue from non-American Airlines aircraft. The decrease was also partially offset by the one-time impact of a contract renewal with one of our airline customers. CA-NA Entertainment and CAS revenue increased to $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $27.6 million for the prior year, primarily due to the recognition of product development-related revenue from one of our airline partners offset in part by the deinstallation of Gogo equipment from certain American Airlines aircraft during 2018 and the first half of 2019. Net annualized ARPA increased to $122 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $111 thousand for the prior year, primarily due to the one-time impact of a contract renewal with one of our airline customers and the product development-related revenue mentioned above, offset in part by the full impact of American Airlines switching to the airline-directed model. The connectivity take rate, which is the number of sessions expressed as a percentage of passengers, increased to 13.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with 11.6% for the prior year, reflecting increased passenger adoption including the impact of third party-paid and airline-paid offerings, primarily under the airline-directed model. We expect service revenue for CA-NA to decrease in the near-term, primarily due to the decommissioning of certain American Airlines aircraft in 2018 and 2019 and the full impact of American Airlines switching to the airline-directed model as well as the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. We expect service revenue for CA-NA to increase in the long-term as the connectivity take rate and net annualized ARPA continue to grow. As the recognition of CA-NA equipment revenue is a function of equipment installation schedules, equipment revenue will be driven by our ability to execute and add additional aircraft to our existing airline partner contracts and enter into new contracts. Business Aviation: BA revenue increased to $309.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $290.2 million for the prior year, due to an increase in service revenue offset in part by a decrease in equipment revenue. BA service revenue increased to $221.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $196.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to more customers subscribing to our Gogo Biz (ATG) service. The number of ATG aircraft online increased 8.5% to 5,669 as of December 31, 2019, as compared with 5,224 as of December 31, 2018. BA equipment revenue decreased to $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $93.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in sales of ATG equipment. We expect service revenue for BA to increase in the future, primarily due to additional ATG aircraft online. Commercial Aviation Rest of World: CA-ROW revenue increased to $148.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $134.4 million for the prior year, due to an increase in service revenue, offset in part by a decrease in equipment revenue. 73 CA-ROW service revenue increased to $88.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $66.4 million for the prior year, due to an increase in aircraft equivalents. Net annualized ARPA for CA-ROW decreased to $130 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $149 thousand for the prior year, due to an increase in aircraft online from new airline partners. CA-ROW equipment revenue decreased to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $68.0 million for the prior year, due to fewer installations under the airline-directed model. We expect service revenue for CA-ROW to decrease in the near term due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. We expect service revenue for CA-ROW to increase in the future, primarily due to an increase in aircraft equivalents. As the recognition of CA-ROW equipment revenue is a function of equipment installation schedules, equipment revenue will be driven by our ability to execute and add additional aircraft to our existing airline partner contracts and enter into new contracts. Cost of Service Revenue: Cost of service revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total CA-NA cost of service revenue decreased to $162.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $174.7 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreases in ATG service revenue, allocated ATG network costs, de-icing-related costs and revenue share, offset in part by increased satellite service fees. BA cost of service revenue increased to $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $42.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in ATG service revenue and allocated ATG network costs. CA-ROW cost of service revenue increased to $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $74.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in satellite service and network fees. We expect cost of service revenue for CA-NA to decline as a percentage of service revenue over time, primarily due to reduced satellite bandwidth unit costs and operating costs, partially offset by increased satellite service fees for additional aircraft operating on our satellite network. We expect cost of service revenue for BA to increase over time, primarily due to increasing ATG network costs associated with Gogo 5G and the change in allocation methodology, as mentioned above. As we expand our CA-ROW business, we expect to incur additional cost of service revenue reflecting increased satellite usage and network related expenses. However, we expect to see increased utilization of our network as we install additional aircraft. 74 Cost of Equipment Revenue: Cost of equipment revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Cost of equipment revenue decreased to $134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $222.2 million for the prior year. The decrease in CA-NA for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the prior year was due to fewer installations under the airline-directed model during 2019 and the impact of the transition to the airline-directed model by one airline in January 2018, which included cost of equipment revenue of approximately $23.8 million, while we had no such activity in 2019; see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. The decrease in BA was due to a decrease in equipment revenue and changes in product mix. The decrease in CA-ROW was due to a decrease in installations under the airline-directed model. We expect that our cost of equipment revenue will vary with changes in equipment revenue. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses decreased to $108.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $120.1 million for the prior year, due to decreased program and personnel-related expenses in CA-ROW and CA-NA, offset in part by increased Gogo 5G development costs at BA. We expect consolidated engineering, design and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of consolidated service revenue over time. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $58.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreased personnel-related expenses in all three segments. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total consolidated service revenue was 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with 9.3% for the prior year. We expect consolidated sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively flat as a percentage of consolidated service revenue. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses decreased to $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $94.3 million for the prior year, primarily due to decreases in legal and personnel-related 75 expenses within unallocated corporate costs and, to a lesser extent, decreases in CA-NA and CA-ROW, offset in part by an increase in BA. Consolidated general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total consolidated service revenue was 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with 15.0% for the prior year. We expect consolidated general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of consolidated service revenue over time. Segment Profit (Loss): CA-NAs reportable segment profit increased to $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $62.3 million for the prior year, primarily due to the changes discussed above. BAs reportable segment profit increased to $144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $140.2 million for the prior year, primarily due to the changes discussed above. CA-ROWs reportable segment loss decreased to $62.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $90.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to the changes discussed above. Unallocated corporate costs decreased to $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $46.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to legal and personnel-related expenses. Unallocated corporate costs are primarily included within general and administrative expenses. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $118.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $133.6 million for the prior year, due to decreased amortization of capitalized software and accelerated depreciation expense for certain upgrades and decommission programs that were completed in the first half of 2018. We expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will vary in the future depending on the number of installations under the turnkey model. Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Interest income Interest expense Loss on extinguishment of debt Other (income) expense Total Total other expense was $181.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared with $138.4 million for the prior year, due to a larger loss on extinguishment of debt and increased interest expense due to higher average debt levels outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the prior year. In 2019, interest costs charged to expense, excluding items such as amortization of deferred financing costs and debt premiums, was $110.6 million as compared with $100.3 million in 2018. See Note 7, Long Term Debt and Other Liabilities, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the loss 76 on extinguishment of debt. See Note 8, Interest Costs, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our interest expense. We expect our interest expense to decrease in the near-term due to the reduction in interest expense related to the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, which were redeemed in full in May 2019, and the partial repurchase of the 2020 Convertible Notes, the remaining outstanding amount of which matured on March 1, 2020. These decreases will be partially offset by higher average debt outstanding because of the issuances of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes in April and May 2019 and the 2022 Convertible Notes in November 2018 and the associated accretion expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for such issuances. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was (0.7%), as compared with 2.0% for the prior year. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was not significant primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. An income tax benefit was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulting from a reduction in our valuation allowance of approximately $4.0 million due to the application of provisions of H.R. 1, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform), to our evaluation of our deferred tax assets. See Note 14, Income Tax, for further details. We expect our income tax provision to increase in future periods to the extent we become profitable. Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 Revenue: Revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Service Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Service Revenue Equipment Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Equipment Revenue Total Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Revenue 77 Commercial Aviation North America: CA-NA revenue increased to $469.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $400.6 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in equipment revenue offset in part by a decrease in service revenue. Equipment revenue increased to $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $7.1 million for the prior year, due to the post-adoption impact of ASC 606 for equipment during 2018, which is now fully recognized upon customer acceptance. Additionally, the transition to the airline-directed model by one airline in January 2018 increased equipment revenue by approximately $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the prior year; see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. A summary of the components of CA-NAs service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Passenger Connectivity revenue (1) Passenger Entertainment and CAS revenue Total service revenue Includes non-session related revenue of $6.9 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. CA-NA service revenue decreased to $367.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $393.5 million for the prior year, due to a decrease in connectivity revenue offset in part by an increase in Entertainment and CAS revenue. CA-NA Connectivity revenue decreased to $339.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $368.9 million for the prior, year due to a decrease in passenger-paid revenue offset in part by an increase in airline-paid revenue, which was primarily due to the transition of one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model from the turnkey model and, to a lesser extent, an increase in third party-paid revenue. Service revenue also decreased due to the economic impact of the same airline partners transition to the airline-directed model. Additionally, CA-NA Connectivity revenue decreased due to the decommissioning of certain American Airlines aircraft during the year ended December 31, 2018. Net annualized ARPA decreased to $111 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $114 thousand for the prior year. The connectivity take rate, which is the number of sessions expressed as a percentage of passengers, increased to 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with 8.3% for the prior year, reflecting increased passenger adoption including the impact of third party-paid and airline-paid offerings, primarily under the airline-directed model. Average revenue per session decreased to $6.97 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $10.33 for the prior year, due to shifts in product mix, third party-paid and airline-paid offerings primarily under the airline-directed model, as well as the economic impact of one of our airline partners transition to the airline-directed model, as discussed above. The increase in Entertainment and CAS revenue to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $24.6 million for the prior year, was due to increased usage of Entertainment services under business-to-business arrangements with our airline partners. 78 Business Aviation: BA revenue increased to $290.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $240.6 million for the prior year, due to an increase in service and equipment revenue. BA service revenue increased to $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $170.9 million for the prior year, primarily due to more customers subscribing to our Gogo Biz (ATG) service. The number of ATG aircraft online increased 11.7% to 5,224 as of December 31, 2018, as compared with 4,678 as of December 31, 2017. BA equipment revenue increased to $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $69.7 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in ATG equipment revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we shipped 34 AVANCE units and recognized $4.9 million of previously deferred equipment revenue as part of a sales program that started in 2016 and for which we have now fully recognized all related deferred revenue under this program. Commercial Aviation Rest of World: CA-ROW revenue increased to $134.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $57.9 million for the prior year, due to an increase in both service revenue and equipment revenue. CA-ROW service revenue increased to $66.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $53.5 million for the prior year, due to an increase in aircraft equivalents. Net annualized ARPA for the CA-ROW segment decreased to $149 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $192 thousand for the prior year due to new airline partners aircraft coming online during the year ended December 31, 2018. CA-ROW equipment revenue increased to $68.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $4.3 million for the prior year, primarily due to the post-adoption impact of ASC 606 for equipment during the year ended December 31, 2018, which is fully recognized upon customer acceptance. Cost of Service Revenue: Cost of service revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total CA-NA cost of service revenue increased to $174.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $149.7 million for the prior year, due to increases in satellite service fees, aircraft operations expenses, costs to remediate quality issues associated with our 2Ku technology and a decrease in the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives offset in part by a decrease in revenue share expense. The changes in amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives and revenue share was primarily due to the transition of one of our airline partners from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model. See Note 15, Leases, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred airborne 79 lease incentives. Cost of service revenue was also impacted by a portion of our supply chain and production activities now being included as part of cost of equipment revenue due to an increase in airline-directed activity. BA cost of service revenue increased to $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $40.8 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased ATG units online and, to a lesser extent, an increase in satellite service fees. CA-ROW cost of service revenue decreased to $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $77.8 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in airline launch costs and network operations expenses. Cost of Equipment Revenue: Cost of equipment revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Cost of equipment revenue increased to $222.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $58.6 million for the prior year. The increase in CA-NA for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with the prior year, was due to an increase in equipment revenue, supply chain and production activities, which, prior to 2018, were included in cost of service revenue, and an increase in warranty reserves due to additional activity under airline-directed models. Additionally, the transition to the airline-directed model by one airline in January 2018 increased cost of equipment revenue by approximately $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the prior year; see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. The increase in BA was due to an increase in equipment revenue and changes in product mix. The increase in CA-ROW was due to the increase in equipment revenue and an increase in warranty reserves due to additional activity under airline-directed models. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses decreased to $120.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $133.3 million for the prior year, due to decreases in all three segments. Engineering, design and development expenses for the CA-NA segment included the recognition of approximately $17 million of expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, related to the development of our next generation ATG solution, primarily due to the achievement of a major milestone whereas we recognized approximately $2 million of similar expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, certification and other regulatory costs directly attributable to our airline-directed customers are capitalized and amortized as part of engineering, design and development costs over the life of the contract. 80 Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $64.0 million for the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in CA-ROW and CA-NA, due to the shift from the turnkey model (business-to-customer) to the airline-directed model (business-to-business) offset in part by an increase in BA. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue was 6.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with 9.2% for the prior year. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses increased slightly to $94.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $93.7 million for the prior year. Consolidated general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue was 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with 13.4% for the prior year. Segment Profit (Loss): CA-NAs reportable segment profit decreased to $62.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $100.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to the changes discussed above. BAs reportable segment profit increased to $140.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $99.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to the changes discussed above. CA-ROWs reportable segment loss decreased to $90.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $102.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to the changes discussed above. Unallocated corporate costs increased to $46.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $45.9 million for the prior year. Unallocated corporate costs are primarily included within general and administrative expenses. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $133.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $145.5 million for the prior year, due to accelerated depreciation expense for certain upgrades and decommission programs that started in the second half of 2017 and were completed in early 2018 and the transition of one of our airline partners from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model. Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Interest income Interest expense Loss on extinguishment of debt Other expense Total 81 Total other expense was $138.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $109.7 million for the prior year. Interest expense increased due to higher average debt levels outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with the prior year. See Note 8, Interest Costs, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our interest expense. The year ended December 31, 2018 also included the loss on extinguishment of debt related to the 2020 Convertible Notes, while the prior year had no such activity. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 2.0%, as compared with 1.1% for the prior year. An income tax benefit was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulting from a reduction in our valuation allowance of approximately $4.0 million due to the application of provisions of U.S. Tax Reform, to our evaluation of our deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred an income tax benefit of $2.0 million, primarily due to the change in the U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of U.S. Tax Reform enacted in December 2017. See Note 14, Income Tax, for further details. Non-GAAP Measures In our discussion below, we discuss certain non-GAAP financial measurements, including Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow as defined below. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow for business planning purposes, including managing our business against internally projected results of operations and measuring our performance and liquidity. These supplemental performance measures also provide another basis for comparing period-to-period results by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. These supplemental performance measurements may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP; when analyzing our performance with Adjusted EBITDA or liquidity with Free Cash Flow or Unlevered Free Cash Flow, as applicable, investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure, and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments, (ii) use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative to, net loss attributable to common stock as a measure of operating results, and (iii) use Free Cash Flow or Unlevered Free Cash Flow in addition to, and not as an alternative to, consolidated net cash provided by (used in) operating activities when evaluating our liquidity. Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA represents net loss attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives, (iii) amortization of STC costs, (iv) the accounting impact of the transition to the airline-directed model, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt and (vi) proceeds from litigation settlement. Our management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that, management believes, have less bearing on our operating performance, thereby highlighting trends in our core business which may not otherwise be apparent. It also provides an assessment of controllable expenses, which are indicators management uses to determine whether current spending decisions need to be adjusted in order to meet financial goals and achieve optimal financial performance. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense from Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate given the significant variation in expense that can result from using the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of such compensation. The fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model and varies based on fluctuations in the assumptions used in this model, including inputs that are not necessarily 82 directly related to the performance of our business, such as the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options. Therefore, we believe that the exclusion of this cost provides a clearer view of the operating performance of our business. Further, stock option grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. While we believe that investors should have information about any dilutive effect of outstanding options and the cost of that compensation, we also believe that stockholders should have the ability to consider our performance using a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these costs and that management uses to evaluate our business. We believe that the exclusion of the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives and amortization of STC costs from Adjusted EBITDA is useful as it allows an investor to view operating performance across time periods in a manner consistent with how management measures reportable segment profit and loss (see Note 11, Business Segments and Major Customers, for a description of reportable segment profit (loss) in our consolidated financial statements). Management evaluates reportable segment profit and loss in this manner, excluding the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives and amortization of STC costs, because such presentation reflects operating decisions and activities from the current period, without regard to the prior period decisions or the business model applicable to various connectivity agreements. We believe that it is useful to an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the accounting impact of the transition by one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model and the loss on extinguishment of debt from Adjusted EBITDA because of the non-recurring nature of these activities. We believe that the exclusion of litigation proceeds from Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as this is non-recurring in nature and represents an infrequent financial benefit to our operating performance. We also present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides investors, securities analysts and other users of our financial statements with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management. Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment and the acquisition of intangible assets. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides meaningful information regarding the Companys liquidity. Unlevered Free Cash Flow represents Free Cash Flow adjusted for cash interest payments and interest income. We believe that Unlevered Free Cash Flow provides an additional view of the Companys liquidity, excluding the impact of our capital structure. 83 Gogo Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (in thousands, except per share amounts) (unaudited) Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss attributable to common stock (GAAP) Interest expense Interest income Income tax provision (benefit) Depreciation and amortization EBITDA Stock-based compensation expense Amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives Amortization of STC costs Transition to airline-directed model Loss on extinguishment of debt Proceeds from litigation settlement Adjusted EBITDA Unlevered Free Cash Flow: Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (GAAP) (1) Consolidated capital expenditures (1) Free cash flow Cash paid for interest (1) Interest income (2) Unlevered free cash flow See consolidated statements of cash flows. See consolidated statements of operations. Material limitations of Non-GAAP measures Although EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are measurements frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow each have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest income or expense; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for our income taxes; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect depreciation and amortization, which are significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of capital expenditures needed to maintain our business; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash components of employee compensation; Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow do not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period; and 84 since other companies in our or related industries may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, their usefulness as comparative measures may be limited. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period Supplemental information: Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period Less: current restricted cash Less: non-current restricted cash Cash and cash equivalents at end of period Short-term investments We have historically financed our growth and cash needs primarily through the issuance of common stock, non-convertible debt, senior convertible preferred stock, convertible debt, term facilities and cash from operating activities. We continually evaluate our ongoing capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, capacity requirements, evolving technologies in our industry and related strategic, operational and technological opportunities. We actively consider opportunities to raise additional capital in the public and private markets utilizing one or more of the types of capital raising transactions through which we have historically financed our growth and cash needs, as well as other means of capital raising not previously used by us. 2024 Senior Secured Notes: On April 25, 2019 (the Issue Date), Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (GIH) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (Gogo Finance and, together with GIH, the Issuers) issued $905 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the Initial Notes) under an indenture (the Base Indenture), dated as of April 25, 2019, among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the Initial 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors and, together with us, the Initial 2024 Guarantors), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee) and collateral agent (the Collateral Agent). On May 3, 2019, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (together with the Base Indenture and the second supplemental indenture, dated as of March 6, 2020, between the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors, Gogo Air International GmbH (an indirect subsidiary of GIH) (Gogo International and, together with the Initial 2024 Guarantors, the 2024 Guarantors) and the Trustee to add Gogo International as a guarantor, the 2024 Indenture) to increase the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred under Credit Facilities (as defined in the 2024 Indenture) by GIH or its subsidiaries that are 2024 Guarantors by $20 million in aggregate principal 85 amount. On May 7, 2019, the Issuers issued an additional $20 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the Additional Notes). We refer to the Initial Notes and the Additional Notes collectively as the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. The Initial Notes were issued at a price equal to 99.512% of their face value, and the Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 100.5% of their face value, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $920.7 million. Additionally, we received approximately $0.1 million for interest that accrued from April 25, 2019 through May 7, 2019 with respect to the Additional Notes that was included in our interest payment on November 1, 2019. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Gogo Inc. and all of GIHs existing and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Gogo Finance), subject to certain exceptions. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees are secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined below) and by first-priority liens on the Cash Flow Priority Collateral (as defined below), including pledged equity interests of the Issuers and all of GIHs existing and future restricted subsidiaries guaranteeing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, except for certain excluded assets and subject to permitted liens. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $925 million, the unaccreted debt discount was $3.9 million and the net carrying amount was $921.1 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to fund the redemption of all the outstanding 2022 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and to repurchase $159 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined below). We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes will mature on May 1, 2024. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2019. We paid approximately $22.0 million of origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs. The deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet are being amortized over the contractual term of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $19.7 million and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are the senior secured indebtedness of the Issuers and are: effectively senior to (i) all of the Issuers existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) the Issuers indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility (as defined below) to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral; effectively equal in right of payment with the Issuers existing and future (i) unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes; structurally senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, including our 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes (each as defined below); senior in right of payment to any and all of the Issuers future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes; 86 structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantors (other than the Issuers); and effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness secured on a senior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of ABL Priority Collateral. Each guarantee is a senior secured obligation of such 2024 Guarantor and is: effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future (i) senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the guarantee, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral; effectively equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing such guarantee; effectively subordinated to the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility of each 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such 2024 Guarantor; effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness, if any, of such 2024 Guarantor; and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantor subsidiary of such 2024 Guarantor (excluding, in the case of our guarantee, the Issuers). The security interests in certain collateral may be released without the consent of holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes if such collateral is disposed of in a transaction that complies with the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements, and if any grantor of such security interests is released from its obligations with respect to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements. Under certain circumstances, GIH and the 2024 Guarantors have the right to transfer certain intellectual property assets that on the Issue Date constitute collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the guarantees to a restricted subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland, resulting in the release of such collateral. In addition, the 2024 Indenture permits indebtedness incurred under the ABL Credit Facility to be secured on a first-priority basis by certain of the same collateral that secures the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. The Issuers may redeem the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus the make-whole premium set forth in the 2024 Indenture as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption date. On or after May 1, 2021, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes will be redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record date on or prior to the redemption date to receive interest due on an interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period commencing on May 1 of the following years: 2021 2022 2023 and thereafter 87 In addition, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 109.875% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of redemption; provided, however, that 2024 Senior Secured Notes representing at least 50% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption. In addition, if GIH receives cash proceeds in connection with the entry into or continuation of a strategic relationship, or equity from us in connection with the sale of stock to a complimentary business (in each case, a strategic investment) at any time prior to May 1, 2020, the Issuers may redeem up to $150 million of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes at 103% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date with the proceeds from such strategic investment. The 2024 Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers and the 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors and, in certain circumstances, our ability, to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of GIHs restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers or make other intercompany transfers; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain transactions with the Issuers affiliates. Most of these covenants will cease to apply if, and for as long as, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes have investment grade ratings from both Moodys Investment Services, Inc. and Standard & Poors. If we or the Issuers undergo specific types of change of control accompanied by a downgrade in the rating of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes prior to May 1, 2024, GIH is required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. The 2024 Indenture provides for events of default, which, if any of them occur, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes issued under the 2024 Indenture to be due and payable immediately. As of December 31, 2019, no event of default had occurred. ABL Credit Facility: On August 26, 2019, Gogo Inc., GIH and Gogo Finance (together GIH and Gogo Finance are referred to as the Borrowers) entered into a credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement) among the Borrowers, the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent), and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent, which provides for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility) of up to $30 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. Borrowing availability under the ABL Credit Facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base collateral calculation that is based on specified percentages of the value of eligible accounts receivable (including eligible unbilled accounts receivable) and eligible credit card receivables, less certain reserves and subject to certain other adjustments as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Availability is reduced by issuance of letters of credit as well as any borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, no revolving loans were outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility. The final maturity of the ABL Credit Facility is August 26, 2022, unless the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) has not, on or prior to December 15, 2021, been repaid in full or refinanced with a new maturity date no earlier than February 26, 2023, in which case the final maturity date shall instead be December 16, 2021. Loans outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at the Borrowers option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate plus an applicable margin ranging 88 from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio. Unused commitments under the ABL Credit Facility are subject to a per annum fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% depending on the average quarterly usage of the revolving commitments. The obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Gogo Inc. and all of its existing and future subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the ABL Guarantors), and such obligations and the obligations of the ABL Guarantors are secured on a (i) senior basis by a perfected security interest in all present and after-acquired inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, securities accounts, and any cash or other assets in such accounts and other related assets owned by each ABL Guarantor and the proceeds of the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions (the ABL Priority Collateral) and (ii) junior basis by a perfected security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets owned by each ABL Guarantor (the Cash Flow Priority Collateral). The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things: the incurrence of additional indebtedness; the incurrence of additional liens; dividends or other distributions on equity; the purchase, redemption or retirement of capital stock; the payment or redemption of certain indebtedness; loans, guarantees and other investments; entering into other agreements that create restrictions on the ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on equity, make or repay certain loans, create or incur certain liens or guarantee certain indebtedness; asset sales; sale-leaseback transactions; swap agreements; consolidations or mergers; amendment of certain material documents; certain regulatory matters; Canadian pension plans; and affiliate transactions. The negative covenants are subject to customary exceptions and also permit dividends and other distributions on equity, investments, permitted acquisitions and payments or redemptions of indebtedness upon satisfaction of the payment conditions. The payment conditions are deemed satisfied upon Specified Availability (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) on the date of the designated action and Specified Availability for the prior 30-day period exceeding agreed-upon thresholds, the absence of the occurrence and continuance of any default and, in certain cases, pro forma compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.10 to 1.00. The ABL Credit Agreement includes a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of no less than 1.00 to 1.00, which is tested only when Specified Availability is less than the greater of (A) $4.5 million and (B) 15.0% of the then effective commitments under the ABL Credit Facility, and continuing until the first day immediately succeeding the last day of the calendar month which includes the thirtieth (30th) consecutive day on which Specified Availability is in excess of such threshold so long as no default has occurred and is continuing and certain other conditions are met. As of December 31, 2019, Specified Availability had not fallen below the amount specified and therefore the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test was not applicable. Full availability under the ABL Credit Facility may be limited by our ability to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio in future periods. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the ABL Credit Facility to be terminated. On August 26, 2019, the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors entered into an ABL collateral agreement (the ABL Collateral Agreement), in favor of the Administrative Agent, whereby the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors granted a security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of each Borrower and each ABL Guarantor, to secure all obligations of the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors under the ABL Credit Agreement, and U.S. Bank National Association, as cash flow collateral representative, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as ABL agent, entered into a crossing lien intercreditor agreement (the Intercreditor Agreement) to 89 govern the relative priority of liens on the collateral that secures the ABL Credit Agreement and the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and certain other rights, priorities and interests. 2022 Senior Secured Notes: On June 14, 2016, the Issuers issued $525 million aggregate principal amount of 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes) under an Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2016 (the Original Indenture), among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the 2022 Subsidiary Guarantors and, together with us, the 2022 Guarantors), and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee and as Collateral Agent. On January 3, 2017, the Issuers issued $65 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the January 2017 Additional Notes). The January 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 108% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $70.2 million. On September 20, 2017, the Issuers, the 2022 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the Supplemental Indenture and, together with the Original Indenture, the Indenture) to modify certain covenants, as discussed below. On September 25, 2017, the Issuers issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the September 2017 Additional Notes). The September 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 113% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $113.0 million. Additionally, we received approximately $2.9 million for interest that accrued from July 1, 2017 through September 24, 2017, which was paid in our January 2018 interest payment. We refer to the Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes, the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes collectively as the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. On April 15, 2019, the Issuers elected to call for redemption in full all $690 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The redemption was conditioned, among other things, upon the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or from one or more other sources, in an amount satisfactory to the Issuers which condition was satisfied by the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. On April 25, 2019, the Issuers irrevocably deposited, or caused to be irrevocably deposited, with the Trustee funds solely for the benefit of the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, cash in an amount sufficient to pay principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the 2022 Senior Secured Notes to, but not including, the date of redemption and all other sums payable under the Indenture. The Trustee executed and delivered an acknowledgement of satisfaction, discharge and release, dated as of April 25, 2019, among other documents, with respect to the satisfaction and discharge of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. On May 15, 2019, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes were fully redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and the amount deposited with the Trustee on April 25, 2019 was paid to the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $51.4 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $9.1 million and the remaining debt premium of $11.7 million relating to the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in connection with the redemption thereof, which together are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. We paid approximately $15.9 million of aggregate origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes which were accounted for as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we paid approximately $1.4 million of consent fees in connection with the Supplemental Indenture, which partially offset the net carrying value of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. Total amortization expense was $0.9 million, $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs were written off as of May 15, 2019. 2022 Convertible Notes: On November 21, 2018, we issued $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including 90 pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances described below. Upon maturity, we have the option to settle our obligation through cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2019. The $237.8 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $188.7 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $49.1 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, we must settle the 2022 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2022 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 13.6%. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding principal on the 2022 Convertible Notes was $237.8 million, the unaccreted debt discount was $35.9 million and $47.7 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $201.9 million and $190.1 million, respectively. We incurred approximately $8.1 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, of which $6.4 million and $1.7 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The $6.4 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $1.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2022 Convertible Notes was $4.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.00 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we currently expect to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes then outstanding. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, we currently expect to deliver shares of our common stock. We may elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Holders may convert the 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time prior to January 15, 2022, but only in the following circumstances: during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) 91 during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day; during the five-business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2022 Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2022 Convertible Notes on each such trading day; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of the above events allowing for conversion prior to January 15, 2022 occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2022 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after January 15, 2022 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2022. In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2022 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. 2020 Convertible Notes: On March 3, 2015, we issued $340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Convertible Notes) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $21.9 million was subsequently exercised during March 2015, resulting in a total issuance of $361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes. We paid interest on the 2020 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest payments began on September 1, 2015. In November 2018, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we repurchased $199.9 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes at par value. As a result of the repurchase, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $17.9 million to face value and included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. On April 18, 2019, we commenced a cash tender offer (the Tender Offer) to purchase any and all of the outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for an amount equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date on the 2020 Convertible Notes to, but not including, the date of payment for the 2020 Convertible Notes accepted in the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer expired on May 15, 2019, resulting in the purchase of $159.0 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. As a result of the Tender Offer, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $8.5 million to face value and unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.6 million were expensed. These two items are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. During September 2019, we purchased an additional $0.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes matured on March 1, 2020. The $361.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $261.9 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $100.0 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes. If we or the 92 holders of 2020 Convertible Notes elected not to settle the debt through conversion, we were required to settle the 2020 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component was accreted up to the face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes, which resulted in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2020 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 11.5%. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding principal on the 2020 Convertible Notes was $2.5 million and $162.0 million, respectively, the unamortized debt discount was zero and $12.8 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $2.5 million and $149.2 million, respectively. We incurred approximately $10.4 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, of which $7.5 million and $2.9 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The $7.5 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2020 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was $0.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2020 Convertible Notes was zero and $0.9 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2020 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 41.9274 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.85 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion and prior to maturity, we expected to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes then outstanding. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, we expected to deliver shares of our common stock. We had the option to elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Forward Transactions: In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we paid approximately $140 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the Forward Transactions) with certain financial institutions (the Forward Counterparties), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to one of the Forward Transactions (the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction) to extend the expected settlement date with respect to approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock held by one of the Forward Counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the 2022 Forward Counterparty), to correspond with the May 15, 2022 maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. In the future, we may request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the 2022 Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the 2022 Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing 93 at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The 2022 Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the 2022 Forward Counterparty on such terms as may be mutually agreed upon at the time. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders equity within our consolidated balance sheet was reduced by approximately $140 million. Between March 5-6, 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. The approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transactions are treated as retired shares for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding. Restricted Cash: Our restricted cash balances were $7.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and primarily consist of letters of credit and cash restricted to repurchase or repay the remaining balance of the 2020 Convertible Notes. Certain of the letters of credit require us to maintain restricted cash accounts in a similar amount, and are issued for the benefit of the landlords at our current office locations in Chicago, IL, Bensenville, IL and Broomfield, CO. Liquidity: Excluding the impact of our initial public offering, our prior credit facility, the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2020 Convertible Notes, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, to date we have not generated positive cash flows on a consolidated basis. However, based on our current plans, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operating activities and access to the ABL Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our near- and long-term operating obligations, including our capital expenditure requirements. As detailed in Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, in April 2019 and May 2019, we entered into financing transactions that extended the maturity of our senior secured indebtedness to 2024 and generated funds sufficient to repay, repurchase or retire our 2020 Convertible Notes (of which we repurchased $159.0 million aggregate principal amount in May 2019 and an additional $0.5 million in September 2019, leaving $2.5 million aggregate principal amount outstanding). In August 2019, we entered into the ABL Credit Facility, which provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. The ABL Credit Agreement provides that the revolving line of credit may be increased by up to an additional $30.0 million under certain circumstances. Our intent is to continue to access the capital markets to refinance our future debt obligations on an as-needed basis. As disclosed elsewhere in this report, the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the CA and BA businesses and our financial and operational performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If our airline partners continue to experience significantly reduced demand for passenger traffic for an extended period, our near term liquidity and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. The extent to which the outbreak affects our liquidity and financial condition will depend in part on our ability to implement various measures intended to reduce expenses and/or conserve cash. See Risk Factors Our business is highly dependent on the airline industry, which is itself affected by factors beyond the airlines control, including the novel strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The airline industry is highly competitive and sensitive to changing economic conditions . The 2024 Indenture and the ABL Credit Agreement contain covenants that limit the ability of GIH and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Further, market conditions and/or our financial performance may limit our access to additional sources of equity or debt financing, or our ability to pursue potential strategic alternatives. As a result, we may be unable to finance growth of our business to the extent that our cash, cash 94 equivalents and short-term investments and cash generated through operating activities prove insufficient or we are unable to raise additional financing through the issuance of additional equity, permitted incurrences of debt by us or by GIH and its subsidiaries, or the pursuit of potential strategic alternatives. For additional information on the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the ABL Credit Facility, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes, see Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements. Cash flows provided by (used in) Operating Activities: The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating activities for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : Net loss Non-cash charges and credits Changes in operating assets and liabilities Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $64.1 million, as compared with cash used in operating activities of $82.3 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the change in operating cash flows were: A $62.6 million change in net loss and non-cash charges and credits, primarily due to increases in CA-NA and BA reportable segment profit and a decrease in CA-ROW reportable segment loss, as noted above under Results of Operations. A $83.8 million increase in cash flows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from: The increase in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities due to the following: Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of collections; Changes in all three segments inventories. CA-NAs and CA-ROWs inventories decreased due to a decrease in airborne equipment purchases and a smaller portion of our uninstalled airborne equipment was allocated to inventory due to the transition of two airline partners from the airline-directed model to the turnkey model in 2019. BAs inventory decreased due to decreased equipment purchases and an increase in equipment revenue during the second half of 2019 as compared with 2018. Partial offsets to the above due to decreases in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities due to the following: Changes in accrued interest due to changes in the timing of payments as compared to the prior year; Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments as compared to the prior year; and Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs warranty reserves, due to more activity under our airline-directed model during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with the prior-year. 95 For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $82.3 million, as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $60.3 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the decrease in operating cash flows were: A $139.2 million decrease in cash flows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from: The decrease in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities due to the following: Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs inventories as we now allocate a portion of our uninstalled airborne equipment to inventory and also an increase in BAs inventory due to builds during the year. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for additional information regarding inventory. Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs contract assets due to activity under airline-directed models during the year ended December 31, 2018 (see Note 4, Revenue Recognition, for additional information); Changes in all three segments deferred revenue as deferred revenue decreased during 2018 but increased in 2017; Changes in all three segments accounts payable, accrued liabilities and prepaid and other expenses, primarily due to the timing of payments; Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs deferred airborne lease incentives due to more installations under the turnkey model in 2017 as compared with 2018, as airlines are transitioning to the airline-directed model and as new airlines are also being signed under the airline-directed model; and Changes in CA-ROWs accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of collections. Partial offsets to the above due to increases in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities due to the following: Changes in CA-NAs and BAs accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of collections; and Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs warranty reserves, due to more activity under our airline-directed model during the year ended December 31, 2018 (see Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for additional information). Cash flows provided by (used in) Investing Activities: Cash used in investing activities was $73.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities was $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and cash used in investing activities was $157.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Investing activities are comprised of capital expenditures related to airborne equipment for the turnkey model, software development, data center upgrades, cell site construction and build-out of our office locations. Cash flows from investing activities were impacted by our allocation of a portion of our equipment purchases to inventory. See Capital Expenditures below. Additionally, cash used in investing activities includes net changes in our short-term investments consisting of a cash inflow of $39.3 million, $173.5 million and $125.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Cash flows provided by Financing Activities: Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.5 million, primarily due to the redemption of all of our outstanding 2022 Senior Secured Notes (including the make-whole premium payable under the indenture governing the 2022 Senior Secured Notes) for a redemption price totaling $741.4 million, the 96 repurchase of $159.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes and the payment of $23.0 million of deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, offset in part by $920.7 million of gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $27.3 million primarily due to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes with gross proceeds of $237.8 million, offset in part by $200.4 million of payments to repurchase 2020 Convertible Notes (comprised of $199.9 million of outstanding principal and $0.5 million of fees), $8.1 million of debt issuance costs and finance lease payments of $2.3 million. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $174.9 million, primarily due to $181.8 million of gross proceeds from the issuances of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in January and September 2017 (the 2022 Additional Senior Secured Notes), offset in part by the payment of debt issuance costs for the 2022 Additional Senior Secured Notes of $3.6 million and finance lease payments of $3.0 million. Capital Expenditures Our operations continue to require significant capital expenditures, primarily for technology development, equipment and capacity expansion. Capital expenditures for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments include the purchase of airborne equipment for the turnkey model, which correlates to the roll out and/or upgrade of service to our airline partners fleets. Capital spending is also associated with the expansion of our ATG and satellite networks and data centers. We capitalize software development costs related to network technology solutions, the Gogo platform and new product/service offerings. We also capitalized costs related to the build out of our office locations. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $115.5 million and $131.7 million, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2019 as compared with 2018 was primarily due to decreases in airborne equipment purchases as well as a decrease in capitalized software. We expect that our airborne-related capital expenditures will vary in the future depending upon the number of installations under the turnkey model and that network-related capital expenditures will increase over time as we build out Gogo 5G. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $131.7 million and $280.2 million, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to a decrease in airborne equipment purchases as a portion of our equipment purchases are now allocated to inventory (see Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts) and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in capitalized software. 97 Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations (including those that require us to make future cash payments) as of December 31, 2019. The future contractual requirements include payments required for our operating leases and contractual purchase agreements (in thousands) . Contractual Obligations: Financing lease obligations Operating lease obligations Purchase obligations (1) 2022 Convertible Notes (2) Interest on 2022 Convertible Notes 2020 Convertible Notes (2) Interest on 2020 Convertible Notes 2024 Senior Secured Notes (2) Interest on 2024 Senior Secured Notes Satellite transponder and teleport services Deferred revenue arrangements (3) Deferred airborne lease incentives (4) Other long-term obligations (5) Total As of December 31, 2019, our outstanding purchase obligations represented obligations to vendors to meet operational requirements as part of the normal course of business and related primarily to information technology, research and development, sales and marketing and production related activities. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for more information. Amounts represent obligations to provide services for which we have already received cash from our customers. Amounts represent the upfront payments made by our airline partners for our airborne equipment and payments for STCs. Upfront payments made pursuant to these agreements are accounted for as deferred airborne lease incentives which are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of cost of service revenue over the term of the agreement. Other long-term obligations consist of estimated payments (undiscounted) for our asset retirement obligations, network transmission services, obligations to certain airline partners, and Canadian ATG Spectrum License related payments related to the monthly C$0.1 million payment over the estimated 25-year term of the agreement, using the December 31, 2019 exchange rate. Other long-term obligations do not include $2.3 million related to our deferred tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of their timing. Contractual Commitments: We have agreements with vendors to provide us with transponder and teleport satellite services. These agreements vary in length and amount and, as of December 31, 2019, commit us to purchase transponder and teleport satellite services totaling approximately $141.3 million in 2020, $129.7 million in 2021, $109.8 million in 2022, $90.6 million in 2023, $85.4 million in 2024 and $289.0 million thereafter. We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase satellite-based systems, certifications and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the equipment or certifications, or as development services are provided. Leases and Cell Site Contracts: We have lease agreements relating to certain facilities and equipment, which are considered operating leases. See Note 15, Leases, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 98 The revenue share paid to our airline partners represents operating lease payments and is deemed to be contingent rental payments, as the payments due to each airline are based on a percentage of our CA-NA and CA-ROW service revenue generated from that airlines passengers, which is unknown until realized. As such, we cannot estimate the lease payments due to an airline at the commencement of our contract with such airline. Rental expense related to the arrangements with commercial airlines included in cost of service revenue is primarily comprised of these revenue share payments offset by the amortization of the deferred airborne lease incentive discussed above. See Note 15, Leases, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Indemnifications and Guarantees : In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors and Officers insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements, including our agreements with commercial airlines, pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our results of operations. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and our debt. We have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments through a variety of securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, and money market funds. Our cash and cash equivalents as of both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 primarily included amounts in bank deposit accounts and money market funds. We believe that a change in average interest rates would not affect our interest income and results of operations by a material amount. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ. Interest: Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest income generated from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents as of both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 included amounts in bank deposit accounts 99 and money market funds; and as of December 31, 2018 our short-term investments consisted of U.S. Treasury bills. We believe we have minimal interest rate risk as a 10% decrease in the average interest rate on our portfolio would have reduced interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 by immaterial amounts. Inflation: We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. Seasonality: Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for any other interim period for the entire year because the demand for air travel, including business travel, is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect overall passenger opportunity to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year due to an increase in leisure travel offset in part by a decrease in business travel during the summer months and holidays. We expect seasonality of the air transportation business to continue, which may affect our results of operations in any one period. 100 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Gogo Inc.

Background Gogo (we, us, our) is the global leader in providing broadband connectivity solutions and wireless in-flight entertainment to the aviation industry. We operate through the following three segments: Commercial Aviation North America, or CA-NA, Commercial Aviation Rest of World, or CA-ROW, and Business Aviation, or BA. Services provided by our CA-NA and CA-ROW businesses include Passenger Connectivity, which allows passengers to connect to the Internet from their personal Wi-Fi-enabled devices; Passenger Entertainment, which offers passengers the opportunity to enjoy a broad selection of in-flight entertainment options on their personal Wi-Fi enabled devices; and Connected Aircraft Services (CAS), which offers airlines connectivity for various operations and currently include, among other services, real-time credit card transaction processing, electronic flight bags and real-time weather information. Services are provided by CA-NA on commercial aircraft flying routes that generally begin and end within North America, which for this purpose includes the United States, Canada and Mexico. CA-ROW provides service on commercial aircraft operated by foreign-based commercial airlines and flights outside of North America for North American-based commercial airlines. The routes included in our CA-ROW segment are those that begin and/or end outside of North America (as defined above) on which our international service is provided. BA provides in-flight Internet connectivity and other voice and data communications products and services and sells equipment for in-flight telecommunications to the business aviation market. BA services include Gogo Biz, our in-flight broadband service, Passenger Entertainment, our in-flight entertainment service, and satellite-based voice and data services through our strategic alliances with satellite companies. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the significant estimates and bases such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Reclassifications To conform with the current year presentation, $652 thousand of the current portion of capital lease liabilities has been combined with accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. Significant Risks and Uncertainties Our operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those associated with continuing losses, fluctuations in operating results, funding of business expansion, strategic alliances, capacity constraints, managing rapid growth and expansion, relationships with customers, suppliers and distributors, financing arrangement terms that may restrict operations, regulatory issues, competition, the economy, technology trends and evolving industry standards. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments We consider cash and cash equivalents to be short-term, highly liquid investments that have the following characteristics: readily convertible to known amounts of cash, so near their maturities that there is insignificant risk of changes in value due to any changes in market interest rates, and having maturities of three months or less when purchased. We continually monitor positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which we invest. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets. We consider short-term investments to be investments with maturities of twelve months or less (but greater than three months). 108 Certain cash amounts are restricted as to use and are classified outside of cash and cash equivalents. See Note 7, Long-term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further details. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. All cash and cash equivalents are invested with creditworthy financial institutions. We perform ongoing credit evaluations and generally do not require collateral to support receivables. See Note 11, Business Segments and Major Customers, for further details. Income Tax We use an asset- and liability-based approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets which are not likely to be realized. On a regular basis, management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance. We also consider the existence of any uncertain tax positions and, as necessary, provide a reserve for any uncertain tax positions at each reporting date. See Note 14, Income Tax, for further details. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of telecommunications systems and parts, and are recorded at the lower of average cost or market. We evaluate the need for write-downs associated with obsolete, slow-moving and nonsalable inventory by reviewing net realizable inventory values on a periodic basis. Historically, inventories were solely related to the BA segment. Starting in 2018, the airborne equipment within our CA-NA and CA-ROW segments became increasingly deployed under airline-directed model agreements (see Revenue Recognition below for additional details), and we currently allocate uninstalled airborne equipment between property and equipment, net, and inventories, based on our forecasts of estimated future installations by contract type. Prior to this allocation, uninstalled airborne equipment for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments was classified as property and equipment, net, as the majority of installations were performed under our turnkey model agreements. See Arrangements with Commercial Airlines, below for additional information on the turnkey model treatment. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for further details. Property and Equipment and Depreciation Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Network asset inventory and construction in progress, which include materials, transmission and related equipment, interest and other costs relating to the construction and development of our network, are not depreciated until they are put into service. Network equipment consists of switching equipment, antennas, base transceiver stations, site preparation costs, and other related equipment used in the operation of our network. Airborne equipment consists of routers, modems, radomes, antennas and related equipment, and accessories installed or to be installed on aircraft under the turnkey model. Depreciation expense totaled $99.2 million, $107.1 million and $120.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for owned assets, which are as follows: Office equipment, furniture, fixtures and other Leasehold improvements Airborne equipment Network equipment 109 See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for further details. Improvements to leased property are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease. We reassess the useful lives of leasehold improvements when there are changes to the terms of the underlying lease. Such reassessment has resulted in the useful life of specific assets being adjusted to a shorter period than originally estimated, resulting in an increase in annual depreciation expense for those assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Due to advances in technology and changes in agreements with our airline partners, with respect to upgrading equipment, we periodically reassess the useful lives of our property and equipment. Such reassessment has resulted in the useful life of specific assets being adjusted to a shorter period than originally estimated, resulting in an increase in annual depreciation expense for those assets. Software Development Costs We capitalize costs for network and non-network software developed or obtained for internal use during the application development stage. These costs include purchased software and direct costs associated with the development and configuration of internal use software that supports the operation of our service offerings. These costs are included in goodwill and intangible assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheets and, when the software is placed in service, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Costs incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. With respect to software sold as part of our equipment sales, we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility has been established. Such capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis, based on the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Our FCC Licenses (as defined in Note 6, Intangible Assets) are our only indefinite-lived intangible assets. We perform our annual impairment tests of goodwill and our FCC Licenses during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of impairment. Our qualitative analysis includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environment, industry and market conditions, financial performance versus budget and any other events or circumstances specific to goodwill and the FCC Licenses. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill and the FCC Licenses is greater than the carrying value, no further testing is required. Otherwise, we will apply the quantitative impairment test method. Our quantitative impairment testing of the FCC Licenses uses the Greenfield method, an income-based approach. When performing this quantitative impairment testing, we estimate the fair value of the goodwill and FCC Licenses asset balances based primarily on projected future operating results, discounted cash flows, and other assumptions. Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, projected operating results and cash flows may not always be achieved. The failure to achieve one or more of our assumptions regarding projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term could reduce the estimated fair value below carrying value and result in the recognition of an impairment charge. The results of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments for 2019, 2018 and 2017 indicated no impairment. 110 Intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are amortized over their useful lives as follows: Software OEM and dealer relationships Service customer relationships Other intangible assets See Note 6, Intangible Assets, for further details. Long-Lived Assets We review our long-lived assets to determine potential impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We do this by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. If we determine an impairment exists, the asset is written down to estimated fair value. There were no impairments of long-lived assets in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Arrangements with Commercial Airlines Pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we place our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines for the purpose of delivering our service to passengers on the aircraft. There are currently two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. See Revenue Recognition, below for additional information on the airline-directed model. Under the turnkey model, we account for equipment transactions as operating leases of space for our equipment on the aircraft. We may be responsible for the costs of installing and/or deinstalling the equipment. Under the turnkey model, the equipment transactions involve the transfer of legal title but do not meet sales recognition for accounting purposes because the risks and rewards of ownership are not fully transferred due to our continuing involvement with the equipment, the length of the term of our agreements with the airlines, and restrictions in the agreements regarding the airlines use of the equipment. Under this model, we refer to the airline as a partner. Under the turnkey model, the assets are recorded as airborne equipment on our consolidated balance sheets, as noted in Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts. Any upfront equipment payments are accounted for as lease incentives and recorded as deferred airborne lease incentives on our consolidated balance sheets and are recognized as a reduction of the cost of service revenue on the straight-line basis over the term of the agreement with the airline. See Note 15, Leases, for further details. Transition Between Commercial Airline Agreements For CA-NA and CA-ROW, pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we place our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines in order to deliver our service to passengers on the aircraft. We currently have two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. Under the airline-directed model, we have transferred control of the equipment to the airline and therefore the airline is our customer in these transactions. Under the turnkey model, while our airline partner generally has legal title to our equipment, we do not transfer control of our equipment to our airline partner and, as a result, the airline passenger is deemed to be our customer. Transactions with our airline partners under the turnkey model are accounted for as an operating lease of space on an aircraft. See Arrangements with Commercial Airlines, above for additional information on the turnkey model. Transition to Turnkey Model : As of January 1, 2019, one airline transitioned from the airline-directed model to the turnkey model. This transition did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations. However, as a result of such transition, $46.8 million of inventory was reclassified to property and equipment, net, as of January 1, 2019. See Inventories above for information regarding the allocation of airborne equipment between Inventories and 111 Property and equipment, net. In September 2019, an additional airline transitioned from the airline-directed model to the turnkey model. This transition did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and resulted in the reclassification of amounts primarily between other non-current assets and operating lease right-of-use assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Transition to Airline-Directed Model : The accounting treatment for one of our airline agreements transitioned from our turnkey model to our airline-directed model in January 2018 due to specific provisions elected by the airline that resulted in the transfer of control of the previously installed connectivity equipment. Upon transition to the airline-directed model, the net book value of all previously delivered equipment classified within property and equipment was reclassified to cost of equipment revenue. Additionally, the unamortized proceeds previously received for equipment and classified within current and non-current deferred airborne lease incentives were eliminated and included as part of estimated contract value, which was then allocated amongst the various performance obligations under the agreement. The value allocated to previously delivered equipment was immediately recognized as equipment revenue in our consolidated financial statements; see Revenue Recognition below for additional disclosures relating to the allocation of consideration among identified performance obligations. For amounts recognized in equipment revenue that were in excess of the amounts billed, we recorded current and non-current contract assets included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other non-current assets, respectively; see Revenue Recognition below for additional details. In connection with the transition of this airline agreement to the airline-directed model, we also established warranty reserves related to previously sold equipment that are still under a warranty period, which is included within accrued liabilities. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts for additional information. This transition from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model occurred on January 4, 2018 and the total financial statement effect on our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations was as follows ( in thousands ): Consolidated balance sheet Prepaid expense and other current assets Property and equipment, net Other non-current assets Accrued liabilities Current deferred airborne lease incentive Non-current deferred airborne lease incentive Consolidated statement of operations Equipment revenue Cost of equipment revenue Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily earned from providing connectivity and entertainment services and through sales of equipment. Additionally, to a lesser extent, we earn revenue from providing ancillary services, including installation and CAS. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; Determination of the transaction price; Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and Recognition of revenue as we satisfy the performance obligations. 112 CA-NA and CA-ROW Service Revenue : CA-NA and CA-ROW revenue consists of service revenue primarily derived from connectivity services and, to a lesser extent, from Entertainment services and CAS. Connectivity is provided to our customers using both our ATG and satellite technologies. Airline-directed connectivity revenue: As noted above, under the airline-directed model, the airline is our customer and we earn service revenue as connectivity services are consumed directly by the airline or indirectly by passengers. Turnkey connectivity revenue (passenger connectivity): Under the turnkey model, passenger connectivity revenue is generated by services paid for by passengers, airlines and third parties. Passenger paid revenue represents point-of-sale sessions (which may be flight-based, time-based, multiple individual session packages (multi-pack) or subscriptions). Flight-based, time-based and multi-pack revenue is recognized when the sessions are used. Subscription revenue is recognized evenly throughout the subscription period, regardless of the number of times the customer uses the network. Third party and airline-paid revenue is generated by sales of connectivity services to airlines or third parties in sponsorship, wholesale, enterprise and roaming arrangements. Sponsorship revenue is recognized over the sponsorship term. Revenue from wholesale, enterprise and roaming arrangements is recognized as sessions are used by the passenger. Entertainment revenue: Entertainment revenue consists of entertainment services we provide to the airline for use by its passengers. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the airline. CAS revenue: CAS revenue includes, among other things, real-time credit card transaction processing, electronic flight bags and real-time weather information. Revenue is recognized as the service is provided. BA Service Revenue : BA service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Equipment Revenue : Equipment revenue primarily consists of the sale of ATG and satellite connectivity equipment and the sale of entertainment equipment. CA-NA and CA-ROW recognize equipment revenue upon acceptance by our airline customers. BA primarily recognizes equipment revenue when the equipment is shipped to OEMs and dealers. Equipment revenue also includes revenue generated by the installation of the connectivity or entertainment equipment on commercial aircraft, which is recognized when the installation is complete. 113 Contract price and allocation considerations : Our CA-NA and CA-ROW airline-directed contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which primarily include the sale of equipment, installation services, connectivity services and entertainment services. For these contracts, we account for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocate the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which is based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer, if available. To the extent a good or service is not sold separately, we use our best estimate of the standalone selling price and maximize the use of observable inputs. The primary method we use to estimate the standalone selling price is the expected cost-plus margin approach. The contractual consideration used for allocation purposes includes connectivity and entertainment services, which may be based on a fixed monthly fee per aircraft or a variable fee based on the volume of connectivity activity, or a combination of both. Examples of variable consideration within our contracts include megabyte overages and pay-per-use sessions. We constrain our estimates to reduce the probability of a significant revenue reversal in future periods, allocate such variable consideration to the identified performance obligations and recognize revenue in the period the services are provided. Our estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated future performance, market conditions and our best judgment at the time. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect our estimated contract value, and we regularly review and update our estimates and recognize adjustments under the cumulative catch-up method. Any adjustment under this method is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period identified and revenue for future periods is recognized using the new adjusted estimate. Research and Development Costs Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and totaled $71.5 million, $72.7 million and $78.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Research and development costs are reported as a component of engineering, design and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Warranty We provide warranties on parts and labor related to our products. Our warranty terms range from two to ten years. Warranty reserves are established for costs that are estimated to be incurred after the sale, delivery and installation of the products under warranty. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence, and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for the details of the changes in our warranty reserve. Asset Retirement Obligations We have certain asset retirement obligations related to contractual commitments to remove our network equipment and other assets from leased cell sites upon termination of the site lease and to remove equipment from aircraft when the service contracts terminate. The asset retirement obligations are classified as a noncurrent liability in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for the details of the changes in our asset retirement obligations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We group financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value into three levels of hierarchy based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. See Note 10, Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities, for further information. 114 Derivatives In March 2015, we entered into the Forward Transactions (as defined and described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities) in which we purchased 7.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $140 million, with an expected settlement date on or around March 13, 2020, and in December 2019, we amended a portion of the Forward Transactions to extend the expected settlement date for approximately 2.1 million of those shares to on or around May 15, 2022. Because the Forward Transactions are indexed to our own stock and classified within stockholders equity, we do not account for the Forward Transactions as derivative instruments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging . See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, Note 9, Common Stock and Preferred Stock, and Note 10, Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities, for further information. Convertible Notes  Proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities) are initially allocated between a liability component (long-term debt) and an equity component (additional paid-in capital), within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component is measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. Net Loss Per Share We calculate basic and diluted net loss per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. See Note 3, Net Loss Per Share, for further information. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Compensation cost is measured and recognized at fair value for all stock-based payments, including stock options. For time-based vesting stock options, we estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends. Restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. For awards with a market condition (which we have used on a limited basis), we estimated fair value using the Monte Carlo Simulation model, which requires assumptions, such as volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life and dividends. Our stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the applicable vesting period, and is included in the same operating expense line items in the consolidated statements of operations as the base cash compensation paid to the underlying employees. See Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation, for further information. Leases In addition to arrangements with commercial airlines which we account for as operating leases as noted above, we have operating lease agreements for which we have recorded lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for leases primarily related to cell sites, office buildings, warehouses and computer and office equipment. We determine whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception and calculate the lease liability and right-of-use asset using our incremental borrowing rate. Our cell site leases generally range in terms of five to ten years, with renewal options for an additional five to 25 years. For certain cell sites, the renewal options are deemed to be reasonably certain to be exercised. Our building leases generally range from one to ten years, with renewal options for an additional one to five years. We recognize operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have finance leases for computer and office equipment. Covenants within the 2024 Senior Secured Notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to enter into new finance lease arrangements. See Note 15, Leases, for further information. 115 Advertising Costs Costs for advertising are expensed as incurred. Debt Issuance Costs We defer loan origination fees and financing costs related to our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we defer fees paid directly to the lenders related to amendments with our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. We amortize these costs over the term of the underlying debt obligation using the effective interest method, and include them in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The fees incurred but not paid directly to the lenders in connection with amendments are expensed as incurred to interest expense. Deferred financing costs associated with future debt issuances are written off in the period during which we determine that the debt will no longer be issued. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities for further information. Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is net loss plus unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Accounting standards adopted: On January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842), using the modified retrospective approach. As a result, we recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 842 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2019. Our historical financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the lease accounting standard in effect for those periods. We elected the practical expedients regarding use of hindsight to evaluate lease terms as well as maintaining lease classifications established under the prior lease accounting standard. Through this practical expedient, we did not reevaluate contracts to determine if they contained a lease. We did not elect the practical expedients regarding short-term leases or the separation of lease and non-lease components. Adoption of ASC 842 had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet through recognition of right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. Adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or our consolidated statements of cash flows and did not result in the recognition of incremental financing leases, formerly referred to as capital leases. The discount rate used to calculate the adjustment to the opening balance was our incremental borrowing rate as of the adoption date, January 1, 2019. The cumulative effect of the adoption of ASC 842 to our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019 was as follows ( in thousands) : Assets Operating lease right-of-use assets Liabilities Accrued liabilities Non-current operating lease liabilities Other non-current liabilities Equity Accumulated deficit See Note 15, Leases, for additional information. 116 On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2018-02), which permits entities to reclassify tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of tax reform to retained earnings. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2018-07), which expands the scope of ASC 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation , to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods or services from nonemployees. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606), using the modified retrospective method. As a result, we recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. Our historical financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the revenue accounting standard in effect for those periods. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, equipment revenue (and related cost) under some of our CA-NA and CA-ROW segment contracts was deferred and recognized over the life of the contract as the equipment and connectivity services did not meet the requirements to be treated as separate units of accounting. Under ASC 606, these same equipment transactions qualify as standalone performance obligations and, therefore, equipment revenue (and related cost) is recognized upon acceptance by our airline customers. Adoption of the new standard did not materially affect the amount or timing of equipment revenue recognized from our BA segment. Our service revenue across all segments continues to be recognized as the services are provided to customers. In conjunction with the adoption of ASC 606, we also adopted Accounting Standard Codification Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs  Contracts with Customers (ASC 340-40), which requires the capitalization of costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. Prior to the adoption of ASC 340-40, we expensed all fulfillment and other costs associated with airline-directed contracts, which were comprised predominantly of costs incurred to obtain supplemental type certificates (STCs); these costs are now required to be capitalized and amortized to expense over the life of the contract (and are included within engineering, design and development in our consolidated financial statements). Costs associated with our turnkey contracts are not eligible for capitalization under ASC 340-40 and will continue to be expensed as incurred. The cumulative effect of the adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 to our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018 was as follows ( in thousands) : Assets Inventories Prepaid expenses and other current assets Property and equipment, net Other non-current assets Liabilities Current deferred revenue Other non-current liabilities Equity Accumulated deficit During the fourth quarter 2018, we identified an additional $0.9 million of property and equipment, net, that should have been included in the transition adjustments as of January 1, 2018. The schedule above reflects the additional adjustment. 117 All other new pronouncements: In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12  Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The amendments in ASU 2019-12 eliminate certain exceptions to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation and interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed projected losses. ASU 2019-12 also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. We will adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2021. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have upon our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. We will adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2020 with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. We are currently evaluating new credit loss models and assessing our processes and controls in preparation for the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Based on the current composition of our investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures is not expected to be material. In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-15, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other  Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (ASU 2018-15), which requires an entity in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. We will adopt this guidance prospectively on January 1, 2020. Adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework  Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (ASU 2018-13). ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements related to recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements. We will adopt this guidance prospectively on January 1, 2020. These changes are expected to only impact how fair value measurements are disclosed, without impacting the measurements themselves. 3. Net Loss Per Share Basic and diluted net loss per share have been calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The shares of common stock effectively repurchased in connection with the Forward Transactions are considered participating securities requiring the two-class method to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share. Net earnings in future periods will be allocated between common shares and participating securities. In periods of a net loss, the shares associated with the Forward Transactions will not receive an allocation of losses, as the counterparties to the Forward Transactions are not required to fund losses. Additionally, the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 excludes the approximately 7.2 million shares associated with the Forward Transactions. As a result of the net loss for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 for the periods where such shares or securities were outstanding, all of the outstanding shares of common stock underlying stock 118 options, deferred stock units and restricted stock units were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding because they were anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017; however, because of the undistributed losses, the shares associated with the Forward Transactions are excluded from the computation of basic earnings per share as undistributed losses are not allocated to these shares ( in thousands, except per share amounts ): Net loss Less: Participation rights of the Forward Transactions Undistributed losses Weighted-average common shares outstanding-basic and diluted Net loss attributable to common stock per share-basic and diluted 4. Revenue Recognition Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of the transaction price in our contracts allocated to the remaining unsatisfied performance obligations is approximately $529 million, most of which relates to our commercial aviation contracts. Approximately $98 million represents future equipment revenue that is expected to be recognized within the next one to three years. The remaining $431 million primarily represents connectivity and entertainment service revenues which are recognized as services are provided, which is expected to occur through the remaining term of the contract (approximately 5-10 years). We have excluded from this amount: all variable consideration derived from our connectivity or entertainment services that is allocated entirely to our performance of obligations related to such services; consideration from contracts that have an original duration of one year or less; and revenue from passenger service on airlines operating under the turnkey model. 119 Disaggregation of revenue The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by category (in thousands) : Service revenue Connectivity Entertainment, CAS and other Total service revenue Equipment revenue ATG Satellite Other Total equipment revenue Customer type Airline passenger and aircraft owner/operator Airline, OEM and aftermarket dealer Third party Total revenue Service revenue Connectivity Entertainment, CAS and other Total service revenue Equipment revenue ATG (1) Satellite (1) Other Total equipment revenue Customer type Airline passenger and aircraft owner/operator Airline, OEM and aftermarket dealer (2) Third party Total revenue ATG and satellite equipment revenue for the CA-NA segment includes $45.4 million related to the accounting impact of the transition of one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model. Approximately $43.4 million was included in ATG equipment revenue and approximately $2.0 million was included in satellite equipment revenue. Airline, OEM and aftermarket dealer revenue includes all equipment revenue for our three segments, including the $45.4 million accounting impact of the transition of one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model. 120 Contract balances Our current and non-current deferred revenue balances totaled $56.7 million and $60.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Deferred revenue includes, among other things, equipment, multi-pack and subscription connectivity products, sponsorship activities and airline-directed equipment and connectivity and entertainment service. Our current and non-current contract asset balances totaled $64.2 million and $59.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Contract assets represent the aggregate amount of revenue recognized in excess of billings for our airline-directed contracts. Capitalized STC balances for our airline-directed contracts were $17.5 million and $16.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The capitalized STC costs are amortized over the life of the associated airline-directed contracts as part of our engineering, design and development costs in our consolidated statements of operations. Total amortization expense was $2.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. 5. Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts Inventories as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows ( in thousands ): Work-in-process component parts Finished goods (1) Total inventory The change between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 includes the $46.8 million accounting impact of one of our airline partner agreements transitioning to the turnkey model in January 2019 (see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information).

Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are comprised of indefinite- and finite-lived intangible assets. We own the rights to both 3MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800 MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (the 3 MHz FCC License), which is used in the operation of our ATG network, and the license for 1 MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (1 MHz FCC License) acquired as part of our acquisition of LiveTV Airfone, LLC. Together we refer to the 3 MHz FCC License and the 1 MHz FCC License as the FCC Licenses. While the FCC Licenses were issued with 10-year terms, such licenses are subject to renewal by the FCC, and renewals of licenses held by others have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that limit the useful life of the FCC Licenses. As a result, the FCC Licenses are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets which we do not amortize. We reevaluate the useful life of the FCC Licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Our annual impairment assessment of the FCC Licenses for 2019, 2018, and 2017 indicated no impairment. Our software relates to the development of internal use software which is used to run our network and support our service offerings.

Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (Gogo Finance and, together with GIH, the Issuers) issued $905 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the Initial Notes) under an indenture (the Base Indenture), dated as of April 25, 2019, among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the Initial 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors and, together with us, the Initial 2024 Guarantors), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee) and collateral agent (the Collateral Agent). On May 3, 2019, the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (together with the Base Indenture and the second supplemental indenture, dated as of March 6, 2020, between the Issuers, the Initial 2024 Guarantors, Gogo Air International GmbH (an indirect subsidiary of GIH) (Gogo International and, together with the Initial 2024 Guarantors, the 2024 Guarantors) and the Trustee to add Gogo International as a guarantor, the 2024 Indenture) to increase the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred under Credit Facilities (as defined in the 2024 Indenture) by GIH or its subsidiaries that are 2024 Guarantors by $20 million in aggregate principal amount. On May 7, 2019, the Issuers issued an additional $20 million aggregate principal amount of 9.875% senior secured notes due 2024 (the Additional Notes). We refer to the Initial Notes and the Additional Notes collectively as the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. The Initial Notes were issued at a price equal to 99.512% of their face value, and the Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 100.5% of their face value, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $920.7 million. Additionally, we received approximately $0.1 million for interest that accrued from April 25, 2019 through May 7, 2019 with respect to the Additional Notes that was included in our interest payment on November 1, 2019. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Gogo Inc. and all of GIHs existing and future restricted subsidiaries (other than Gogo Finance), subject to certain exceptions. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes and the related 125 guarantees are secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Priority Collateral (as defined below) and by first-priority liens on the Cash Flow Priority Collateral (as defined below), including pledged equity interests of the Issuers and all of GIHs existing and future restricted subsidiaries guaranteeing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, except for certain excluded assets and subject to permitted liens. As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $925 million, the unaccreted debt discount was $3.9 million and the net carrying amount was $921.1 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to fund the redemption of all the outstanding 2022 Senior Secured Notes (as defined below) and to repurchase $159 million aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined below). We intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes will mature on May 1, 2024. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 9.875% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2019. We paid approximately $22.0 million of origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs. The deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet are being amortized over the contractual term of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes was $19.7 million and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2024 Senior Secured Notes are the senior secured indebtedness of the Issuers and are: effectively senior to (i) all of the Issuers existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) the Issuers indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility (as defined below) to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral; effectively equal in right of payment with the Issuers existing and future (i) unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes; structurally senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, including our 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes (each as defined below); senior in right of payment to any and all of the Issuers future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes; structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantors (other than the Issuers); and effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness secured on a senior priority basis by the same collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such collateral, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of ABL Priority Collateral. 126 Each guarantee is a senior secured obligation of such 2024 Guarantor and is: effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future (i) senior unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the guarantee, including the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the Cash Flow Priority Collateral; effectively equal in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the guarantee owned by such 2024 Guarantor, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing such guarantee; effectively subordinated to the obligations under the ABL Credit Facility of each 2024 Guarantor to the extent of the value of the ABL Priority Collateral owned by such 2024 Guarantor; effectively senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness, if any, of such 2024 Guarantor; and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-2024 Guarantor subsidiary of such 2024 Guarantor (excluding, in the case of our guarantee, the Issuers). The security interests in certain collateral may be released without the consent of holders of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes if such collateral is disposed of in a transaction that complies with the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements, and if any grantor of such security interests is released from its obligations with respect to the 2024 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 2024 Indenture and related security agreements. Under certain circumstances, GIH and the 2024 Guarantors have the right to transfer certain intellectual property assets that on the Issue Date constitute collateral securing the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or the guarantees to a restricted subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland, resulting in the release of such collateral. In addition, the 2024 Indenture permits indebtedness incurred under the ABL Credit Facility to be secured on a first-priority basis by certain of the same collateral that secures the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. The Issuers may redeem the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus the make-whole premium set forth in the 2024 Indenture as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption date. On or after May 1, 2021, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes will be redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record date on or prior to the redemption date to receive interest due on an interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period commencing on May 1 of the following years: 2021 2022 2023 and thereafter In addition, at any time prior to May 1, 2021, the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 109.875% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of redemption; provided, however, that 2024 Senior Secured Notes representing at least 50% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption. 127 In addition, if GIH receives cash proceeds in connection with the entry into or continuation of a strategic relationship, or equity from us in connection with the sale of stock to a complimentary business (in each case, a strategic investment) at any time prior to May 1, 2020, the Issuers may redeem up to $150 million of the aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes at 103% of the principal amount of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date with the proceeds from such strategic investment. The 2024 Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers and the 2024 Subsidiary Guarantors and, in certain circumstances, our ability, to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of GIHs restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers or make other intercompany transfers; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain transactions with the Issuers affiliates. Most of these covenants will cease to apply if, and for as long as, the 2024 Senior Secured Notes have investment grade ratings from both Moodys Investment Services, Inc. and Standard & Poors. If we or the Issuers undergo specific types of change of control accompanied by a downgrade in the rating of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes prior to May 1, 2024, GIH is required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. The 2024 Indenture provides for events of default, which, if any of them occur, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding 2024 Senior Secured Notes issued under the 2024 Indenture to be due and payable immediately. As of December 31, 2019, no event of default had occurred. ABL Credit Facility On August 26, 2019, Gogo Inc., GIH and Gogo Finance (together GIH and Gogo Finance are referred to as the Borrowers) entered into a credit agreement (the ABL Credit Agreement) among the Borrowers, the other loan parties party thereto, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent), and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent, which provides for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility) of up to $30 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and includes letter of credit and swingline sub-facilities. Borrowing availability under the ABL Credit Facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base collateral calculation that is based on specified percentages of the value of eligible accounts receivable (including eligible unbilled accounts receivable) and eligible credit card receivables, less certain reserves and subject to certain other adjustments as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement. Availability is reduced by issuance of letters of credit as well as any borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, no revolving loans were outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility. The final maturity of the ABL Credit Facility is August 26, 2022, unless the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) has not, on or prior to December 15, 2021, been repaid in full or refinanced with a new maturity date no earlier than February 26, 2023, in which case the final maturity date shall instead be December 16, 2021. Loans outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at the Borrowers option, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio. Unused commitments under the ABL Credit Facility are subject to a per annum fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% depending on the average quarterly usage of the revolving commitments. The obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Gogo Inc. and all of its existing and future subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the ABL Guarantors), and such obligations and 128 the obligations of the ABL Guarantors are secured on a (i) senior basis by a perfected security interest in all present and after-acquired inventory, accounts receivable, deposit accounts, securities accounts, and any cash or other assets in such accounts and other related assets owned by each ABL Guarantor and the proceeds of the foregoing, subject to certain exceptions (the ABL Priority Collateral) and (ii) junior basis by a perfected security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets owned by each ABL Guarantor (the Cash Flow Priority Collateral). The ABL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things: the incurrence of additional indebtedness; the incurrence of additional liens; dividends or other distributions on equity; the purchase, redemption or retirement of capital stock; the payment or redemption of certain indebtedness; loans, guarantees and other investments; entering into other agreements that create restrictions on the ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on equity, make or repay certain loans, create or incur certain liens or guarantee certain indebtedness; asset sales; sale-leaseback transactions; swap agreements; consolidations or mergers; amendment of certain material documents; certain regulatory matters; Canadian pension plans; and affiliate transactions. The negative covenants are subject to customary exceptions and also permit dividends and other distributions on equity, investments, permitted acquisitions and payments or redemptions of indebtedness upon satisfaction of the payment conditions. The payment conditions are deemed satisfied upon Specified Availability (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) on the date of the designated action and Specified Availability for the prior 30-day period exceeding agreed-upon thresholds, the absence of the occurrence and continuance of any default and, in certain cases, pro forma compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.10 to 1.00. The ABL Credit Agreement includes a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of no less than 1.00 to 1.00, which is tested only when Specified Availability is less than the greater of (A) $4.5 million and (B) 15.0% of the then effective commitments under the ABL Credit Facility, and continuing until the first day immediately succeeding the last day of the calendar month which includes the thirtieth (30th) consecutive day on which Specified Availability is in excess of such threshold so long as no default has occurred and is continuing and certain other conditions are met. As of December 31, 2019, Specified Availability had not fallen below the amount specified and therefore the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test was not applicable. Full availability under the ABL Credit Facility may be limited by our ability to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio in future periods. The ABL Credit Agreement provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately and the commitments under the ABL Credit Facility to be terminated. On August 26, 2019, the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors entered into an ABL collateral agreement (the ABL Collateral Agreement), in favor of the Administrative Agent, whereby the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors granted a security interest in substantially all tangible and intangible assets of each Borrower and each ABL Guarantor, to secure all obligations of the Borrowers and the ABL Guarantors under the ABL Credit Agreement, and U.S. Bank National Association, as cash flow collateral representative, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as ABL agent, entered into a crossing lien intercreditor agreement (the Intercreditor Agreement) to govern the relative priority of liens on the collateral that secures the ABL Credit Agreement and the 2024 Senior Secured Notes and certain other rights, priorities and interests. 2022 Senior Secured Notes On June 14, 2016, the Issuers issued $525 million aggregate principal amount of 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes) under an Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2016 (the Original Indenture), among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the 2022 Subsidiary Guarantors and, together with us, the 2022 Guarantors), and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee and as Collateral Agent. On January 3, 2017, the Issuers issued $65 million 129 aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the January 2017 Additional Notes). The January 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 108% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $70.2 million. On September 20, 2017, the Issuers, the 2022 Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the Supplemental Indenture and, together with the Original Indenture, the Indenture) to modify certain covenants, as discussed below. On September 25, 2017, the Issuers issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the September 2017 Additional Notes). The September 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 113% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $113.0 million. Additionally, we received approximately $2.9 million for interest that accrued from July 1, 2017 through September 24, 2017, which was paid in our January 2018 interest payment. We refer to the Original 2022 Senior Secured Notes, the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes collectively as the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. On April 15, 2019, the Issuers elected to call for redemption in full all $690 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The redemption was conditioned, among other things, upon the incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes or from one or more other sources, in an amount satisfactory to the Issuers which condition was satisfied by the issuance of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes. On April 25, 2019, the Issuers irrevocably deposited, or caused to be irrevocably deposited, with the Trustee funds solely for the benefit of the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, cash in an amount sufficient to pay principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the 2022 Senior Secured Notes to, but not including, the date of redemption and all other sums payable under the Indenture. The Trustee executed and delivered an acknowledgement of satisfaction, discharge and release, dated as of April 25, 2019, among other documents, with respect to the satisfaction and discharge of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. On May 15, 2019, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes were fully redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and the amount deposited with the Trustee on April 25, 2019 was paid to the holders of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. The make-whole premium paid in connection with the redemption was $51.4 million and we wrote off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $9.1 million and the remaining debt premium of $11.7 million relating to the 2022 Senior Secured Notes in connection with the redemption thereof, which together are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. We paid approximately $15.9 million of aggregate origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes which were accounted for as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we paid approximately $1.4 million of consent fees in connection with the Supplemental Indenture, which partially offset the net carrying value of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes. Total amortization expense was $0.9 million, $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs were written off as of May 15, 2019. Convertible Notes 2022 Convertible Notes On November 21, 2018, we issued $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances described below. Upon maturity, we have the option to settle our obligation through cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2019. 130 The $237.8 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $188.7 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $49.1 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, we must settle the 2022 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2022 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 13.6%. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding principal on the 2022 Convertible Notes was $237.8 million, the unaccreted debt discount was $35.9 million and $47.7 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $201.9 million and $190.1 million, respectively. We incurred approximately $8.1 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, of which $6.4 million and $1.7 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The $6.4 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $1.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2022 Convertible Notes was $4.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.00 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we currently expect to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes then outstanding. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, we currently expect to deliver shares of our common stock. We may elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Holders may convert the 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time prior to January 15, 2022, but only in the following circumstances: during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day; during the five-business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2022 Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2022 Convertible Notes on each such trading day; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of the above events allowing for conversion prior to January 15, 2022 occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 131 2022 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after January 15, 2022 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2022. In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2022 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. 2020 Convertible Notes On March 3, 2015, we issued $340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Convertible Notes) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $21.9 million was subsequently exercised during March 2015, resulting in a total issuance of $361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes. We paid interest on the 2020 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest payments began on September 1, 2015. In November 2018, in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we repurchased $199.9 million outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes at par value. As a result of the repurchase, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $17.9 million to face value and included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. On April 18, 2019, we commenced a cash tender offer (the Tender Offer) to purchase any and all of the outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes for an amount equal to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date on the 2020 Convertible Notes to, but not including, the date of payment for the 2020 Convertible Notes accepted in the Tender Offer. The Tender Offer expired on May 15, 2019, resulting in the purchase of $159.0 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. As a result of the Tender Offer, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes was adjusted by $8.5 million to face value and unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.6 million were expensed. These two items are included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. During September 2019, we purchased an additional $0.5 million of outstanding 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes matured on March 1, 2020. The $361.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $261.9 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $100.0 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes. If we or the holders of 2020 Convertible Notes elected not to settle the debt through conversion, we were required to settle the 2020 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component was accreted up to the face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes, which resulted in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2020 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 11.5%. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding principal on the 2020 Convertible Notes was $2.5 million and $162.0 million, respectively, the unamortized debt discount was zero and $12.8 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $2.5 million and $149.2 million, respectively. 132 We incurred approximately $10.4 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, of which $7.5 million and $2.9 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The $7.5 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2020 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was $0.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2020 Convertible Notes was zero and $0.9 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2020 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 41.9274 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.85 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion and prior to maturity, we expected to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes then outstanding. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, we expected to deliver shares of our common stock. We had the option to elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion were excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Forward Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we paid approximately $140 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the Forward Transactions) with certain financial institutions (the Forward Counterparties), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to one of the Forward Transactions (the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction) to extend the expected settlement date with respect to approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock held by one of the Forward Counterparties, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (the 2022 Forward Counterparty), to correspond with the May 15, 2022 maturity date for the 2022 Convertible Notes. In the future, we may request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of the Amended and Restated Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, the 2022 Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by the 2022 Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The 2022 Forward Counterparty is not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request that the 2022 Forward Counterparty effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the 2022 Forward Counterparty on such terms as may be mutually agreed upon at the time. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders equity within our consolidated balance sheet was reduced by approximately $140 million. Between March 5-6, 2020, approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were delivered to us in connection with the Forward Transactions. The approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock remaining under the Amended and Restated Forward Transactions are treated as retired shares for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding. Restricted Cash Our restricted cash balances were $7.7 million and $7.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and primarily consist of letters of credit and cash restricted to repurchase or repay 133 the remaining balance of the 2020 Convertible Notes. Certain of the letters of credit require us to maintain restricted cash accounts in a similar amount, and are issued for the benefit of the landlords at our current office locations in Chicago, IL, Bensenville, IL and Broomfield, CO. 8. Interest Costs The following is a summary of our interest costs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands) : Interest costs charged to expense Amortization of deferred financing costs Accretion of debt discount Amortization of debt premium Interest expense Interest costs capitalized to property and equipment Interest costs capitalized to software Total interest costs We capitalize a portion of our interest on funds borrowed during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and amortized over the useful lives of the assets. 9. Common Stock and Preferred Stock Common Stock We have one class of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our common stock is junior to our preferred stock, if and when issued. Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes a total of 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 100,000,000 shares of new preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. No shares of this new preferred stock have been issued. The preferred stock may be issued, from time to time, in one or more series as authorized by the Board of Directors, which has the authority to designate the terms of any series of preferred stock issued, including, without limitation, the number of shares to be included in such series of preferred stock, any dividend, redemption, conversion rights or voting powers and the designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights. 10. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2 defined as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and 134 Level 3 defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. Long-Term Debt: Our financial assets and liabilities that are disclosed but not measured at fair value include the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2020 Convertible Notes, and, while outstanding, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes, which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet at cost. The fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since they are based on quoted market prices of our instruments in markets that are not active. We estimated the fair value of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2020 Convertible Notes, and, while outstanding, the 2022 Senior Secured Notes by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume these obligations. The upfront cash payments used in the calculations of fair value on our December 31, 2019 consolidated balance sheet, excluding any issuance costs, are the amount that a market participant would be willing to lend at December 31, 2019 to an entity with a credit rating similar to ours and that would allow such an entity to achieve sufficient cash inflows to cover the scheduled cash outflows under the 2024 Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes. The calculated fair value of the 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes is correlated to our stock price and as a result, significant changes to our stock price could have a significant impact on their calculated fair values. The fair value and carrying value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (in thousands) : 2024 Senior Secured Notes 2022 Senior Secured Notes 2022 Convertible Notes 2020 Convertible Notes Fair value amounts are rounded to the nearest million, except for the 2020 Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2019. Carrying value of the 2024 Senior Secured Notes reflects the unaccreted debt discount of $3.9 million as of December 31, 2019. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. Carrying value of the 2022 Senior Secured Notes reflects the unamortized debt premium and consent fees of $12.7 million as of December 31, 2018. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. Carrying value of the 2022 Convertible Notes reflects the unaccreted debt discount of $35.9 million and $47.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. Carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes reflects the unaccreted debt discount of $12.8 million as of December 31, 2018. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. We have held-to-maturity financial instruments where carrying value approximated fair value. There were no fair value adjustments to these financial instruments during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. 11. Business Segments and Major Customers During the fourth quarter of 2019, we revised the presentation of our reportable segments operating results in order to exclude the impact of certain corporate costs from the calculation of total reportable segment profit (loss). All amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. 135 We operate our business through three operating segments: Commercial Aviation North America, or CA-NA, Commercial Aviation Rest of World, or CA-ROW and Business Aviation, or BA. CA-NA Segment: Our CA-NA segment provides in-flight connectivity and wireless digital entertainment solutions to commercial airline passengers flying routes that generally begin and end within North America, which for this purpose includes the United States, Canada and Mexico. CA-ROW Segment: Our CA-ROW business provides in-flight connectivity and wireless digital entertainment solutions to passengers flying on foreign-based commercial airlines and flights outside of North America for North American-based commercial airlines. The routes included in our CA-ROW segment are those that begin and/or end outside of North America (as defined above) for which our international service is provided. BA Segment : Our BA business provides equipment for in-flight connectivity along with voice and data services to the business aviation market. BA services include Gogo Biz, our in-flight broadband service that utilizes both our ATG network and our ATG spectrum, Passenger Entertainment, our in-flight entertainment service, and satellite-based voice and data services through strategic alliances with satellite companies. Customers include business aircraft manufacturers, owners, and operators, as well as government and military entities. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany transactions between segments are excluded as they are not included in managements performance review of the segments. Our foreign revenue accounted for less than 15% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We do not segregate assets between segments for internal reporting. Therefore, asset-related information has not been presented. We do not disclose assets outside of the United States as they totaled less than 15% of our consolidated assets as of both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. For our airborne assets, we consider only those assets installed in aircraft associated with international commercial airline partners to be owned outside of the United States. Management evaluates performance and allocates resources to each segment based on reportable segment profit (loss), which is calculated internally as net income (loss) attributable to common stock before unallocated corporate costs, interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain non-cash items (including amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives, stock-based compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of STC costs and the accounting impact of the transition to the airline-directed model) and other income (expense). Reportable segment profit (loss) is a measure of performance reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and evaluating segment performance. In addition, reportable segment profit (loss) is included herein in conformity with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting . Management believes that reportable segment profit (loss) provides useful information for analyzing and evaluating the underlying operating results of each segment. However, reportable segment profit (loss) should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common stock or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, our computation of reportable segment profit (loss) may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies. 136 Information regarding our reportable segments is as follows ( in thousands ): Service revenue Equipment revenue Total revenue Reportable segment profit (loss) Service revenue Equipment revenue (1) Total revenue Reportable segment profit (loss) Service revenue Equipment revenue Total revenue Reportable segment profit (loss) CA-NA equipment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the accounting impact of the transition of one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. 137 A reconciliation of total reportable segment profit (loss) to the relevant consolidated amounts is as follows ( in thousands ): CA-NA segment profit CA-ROW segment loss BA segment profit Total reportable segment profit Unallocated corporate costs (1) Interest income Interest expense Depreciation and amortization Transition to airline-directed model Amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives Amortization of STC costs Stock-based compensation expense Loss on extinguishment of debt Other income (expense) Loss before income taxes Represents costs that are not directly attributable to the reportable segments, comprised primarily of the costs of corporate functions, including executive, legal, finance and human resources, but excluding stock-based compensation expense for those functions of $6.1 million, $5.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively, for the years ending December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Major Customers and Airline Partnerships Revenue earned from Delta and its passengers accounted for approximately 28%, 23% and 26% of consolidated revenue, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Delta accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated accounts receivable as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018. Revenue earned from American Airlines accounted for less than 10% and approximately 22% of consolidated revenue, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Revenue earned from American Airlines for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $45.4 million of equipment revenue recognized due to the airlines transition to the airline-directed model in January 2018. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. Revenue earned from passengers on aircraft operated by American Airlines, which was under the turnkey model during the year ended December 31, 2017, accounted for approximately 21% of consolidated revenue. American Airlines accounted for less than 10% of consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019 and approximately 11% of consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018. 12. Stock-Based Compensation As of December 31, 2019, we maintained three stock-based incentive compensation plans: the Gogo Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2016 Omnibus Plan), the Gogo Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2013 Omnibus Plan), and The Aircell Holdings Inc. Stock Option Plan, collectively referred to as the Stock Plans, as well as an ESPP, as defined and discussed below. Our Stock Plans provide for the grant of both equity and cash awards, including non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards (shares and units), restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), deferred share units (DSUs) and other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents to eligible employees, directors and consultants, as determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. 138 Under the Stock Plans, 27,906,570 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. As of December 31, 2019, 5,097,835 shares remained available for grant under our Stock Plans. The contractual life of granted options is 10 years. All options that are unvested as of the date on which a recipients employment terminates, as well as vested options that are not exercised within a prescribed period following termination, are forfeited and become available for future grants. Options granted to date include options that (a) vest 20% upon grant with the remainder vesting in equal annual increments over a four-year period, (b) vest over a four-year period with 25% vesting on the anniversary of each grant date, (c) vest 25% after one year from grant date and in equal monthly increments for the following three years or (d) vest on the date of grant for options granted to non-employee members of our board of directors. Beginning in 2013, we granted RSUs that vest in equal annual increments over a four-year period. Vested RSUs will be settled, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, in shares of our common stock or in cash equal to the value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock on the vesting date. We also granted directors DSUs that were vested at grant. DSUs will be settled in shares of our common stock 90 days after the director ceases to serve as a director. Beginning in 2014, we granted restricted stock, which vests in equal annual increments over a four-year period. These shares are deemed issued as of the date of grant, but not outstanding until they vest. We intend to settle RSU, DSU and restricted stock awards in stock and we have the shares available to do so. In June 2016, the Compensation Committee approved grants of both non-market based awards and market based awards. The contractual term and time-based vesting provisions for the non-market based awards are consistent with prior grants as noted above. The market based awards vest based on achieving one or more predetermined market conditions and completion of the same time-based vesting requirements applicable to the non-market based awards. The following is a summary of our stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations for the years December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands) : Cost of service revenue Cost of equipment revenue Engineering, design and development Sales and marketing General and administrative Total stock-based compensation expense A summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 is as follows: Options outstandingJanuary 1, 2019 Granted Exercised Forfeited Expired Options outstandingDecember 31, 2019 Options exercisableDecember 31, 2019 139 As of December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options were approximately $9 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.8 years. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested in 2019, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $8 million, $9 million and $10 million, respectively. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Weighted average assumptions used and weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows: Approximate risk-free interest rate Average expected life (years) Dividend yield Volatility Weighted average grant date fair value of common stock underlying options granted Weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the term that mirrored the expected term in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of our stock options was determined based upon a simplified assumption that the stock options will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life. The dividend yield was based on expected dividends at the time of grant. We have not been a public company long enough to calculate volatility based exclusively on our own common stock. Therefore, the expected volatility is calculated as of each grant date based on a weighting of our own common stock and reported data for a peer group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. Beginning in 2020, we will calculate volatility based exclusively on our own common stock. The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs and DSUs for the year ended December 31, 2019: UnvestedJanuary 1, 2019 Granted Vested Forfeited/canceled UnvestedDecember 31, 2019 As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $13 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years. The total grant date fair value of RSUs and DSUs vested in 2019 was approximately $7 million. 140 The following table summarizes the activity for our restricted stock for the year ended December 31, 2019: UnvestedJanuary 1, 2019 Granted Vested Forfeited/canceled UnvestedDecember 31, 2019 As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee restricted stock. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.1 years. ESPP - In June 2013, the Board of Directors and stockholders approved the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which became effective on June 26, 2013, and in 2017, the ESPP was amended to increase the number of shares reserved thereunder. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of common stock during pre-specified offering periods at a discount established by the Compensation Committee not to exceed 15% of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period (whichever is lower). Under the ESPP, 1,200,000 shares were reserved for issuance and 304,831 shares of common stock were issued during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, 178,349 shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP. 13. Employee Retirement and Postretirement Benefits 401(k) Plan - Under our 401(k) plan, all employees who are eligible to participate are entitled to make tax-deferred contributions, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. We match 100% of the employees first 4% of contributions made, subject to annual limitations. Our matching contributions were $5.2 million, $5.1 million, and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 14. Income Tax For financial reporting purposes, loss before income taxes included the following components for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 ( in thousands ): United States Foreign Loss before income taxes 141 Significant components of the (benefit) provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 are as follows ( in thousands ): Current: Federal State Foreign Deferred: Federal State Total The (benefit) provision for income taxes differs from income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 as a result of the following items: Federal statutory rate Effect of: Impact of change in tax rate Change in valuation allowance State income taxes-net of federal tax benefit Other Effective tax rate 142 Components of the net deferred income tax asset as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows ( in thousands ): Deferred income tax assets: Compensation accruals Stock options Inventory Warranty reserves Deferred rent Deferred revenue Federal net operating loss (NOL) State NOL Interest carryforward UNICAP adjustment Finite-lived intangible assets Lease liability Other Total deferred income tax assets Deferred income tax liabilities: Fixed assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets Convertible Notes discount Right-of-use asset Other Total deferred income tax liabilities Total deferred income tax Valuation allowance Net deferred income tax liability We assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized through the generation of future taxable income. We generated net losses in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, which means we are in a domestic three-year cumulative loss position. As a result of this and other assessments in fiscal year 2019, we concluded that a full valuation allowance is required for all deferred tax assets and liabilities except for deferred tax liabilities associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. As of December 31, 2019, the federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforward amount was approximately $579 million and the state NOL carryforward amount was approximately $430 million. The federal NOLs begin to expire in 2031. The state NOLs expire in various tax years and began to expire in 2016. Utilization of our NOL, interest carryforward and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The interest carryforward arises from U.S. Tax Reform and limits the interest expense deduction to 30% of EBITDA for tax years 2018 to 2021 and 30% of EBIT for 2022 and subsequent years. The interest carryforward will not expire as it may be carried forward indefinitely. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three-year period. 143 We are subject to taxation in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia, China, France, Germany, the Netherlands and India. With few exceptions, as of December 31, 2019, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016. As a result of the passage of H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform) in December 2017, the tax effected amounts of the deferred tax assets and liabilities decreased. A large portion of this change in the deferred tax balances resulted in an offsetting change to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and did not affect tax expense. For the deferred tax liabilities that are not offset by changes to the valuation allowance, our net deferred tax liability was reduced by approximately $3 million. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits. We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision line item in the consolidated statement of operations. No penalties or interest related to uncertain tax positions were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not have a liability recorded for interest or potential penalties. We do not expect a change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. 15. Leases The following is a summary of our lease expense included in the consolidated statement of operations (in thousands) : Operating lease cost Financing lease cost Amortization of leased assets Interest on lease liabilities Total lease cost 144 Other information regarding our leases is as follows (in thousands, except lease terms and discount rates) : Supplemental cash flow information Cash paid for amounts included in measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows used in operating leases Operating cash flows used in financing leases Financing cash flows used in financing leases Non-cash items: Operating leases obtained Modifications to operating leases Finance leases obtained Weighted average remaining lease term Operating leases Financing leases Weighted average discount rate Operating leases Financing leases Annual future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands) : 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total future minimum lease payments Less: Amount representing interest Present value of net minimum lease payments Reported as of December 31, 2019 Accrued liabilities Non-current operating lease liabilities Other non-current liabilities Total lease liabilities As of December 31, 2019, we had one operating lease that had not yet commenced with a present value of net minimum lease payments of $6 million. Such lease will commence in 2020. Arrangements with Commercial Airlines  Pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we place our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines for the purpose of delivering our service to passengers on the aircraft. There are currently two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information on airline-directed arrangements. 145 We recognized $28.6 million, $31.7 million, and $41.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, as a reduction to cost of service revenue in our consolidated statements of operations from the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives. As of December 31, 2019, deferred airborne lease incentives of $26.6 million and $135.4 million, respectively, are included in current and non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2018, deferred airborne lease incentives of $24.1 million and $129.1 million, respectively, are included in current and non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. Under the turnkey model, the revenue share paid to our airline partners represents operating lease payments. They are deemed to be contingent rental payments, as the payments due to each airline are based on a percentage of our CA-NA and CA-ROW service revenue generated from that airlines passengers, which is unknown until realized. Therefore, we cannot estimate the lease payments due to an airline at the commencement of our contract with such airline. This rental expense is included in cost of service revenue and is partially offset by the amortization of the deferred airborne lease incentives discussed above. Such rental expenses totaled a net charge of $25.1 million, $24.5 million, and $30.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. 16. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Commitments We have agreements with vendors to provide us with transponder and teleport satellite services. These agreements vary in length and amount and as of December 31, 2019 commit us to purchase transponder and teleport satellite services totaling approximately $141.3 million in 2020, $129.7 million in 2021, $109.8 million in 2022, $90.6 million in 2023, $85.4 million in 2024 and $289.0 million thereafter. We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase satellite-based systems, certifications and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the equipment or certifications, or as development services are provided. Damages and Penalties We have entered into a number of agreements with our airline partners that require us to provide a credit or pay penalties or liquidated damages to our airline partners on a per aircraft, per day or per hour basis if we are delayed in delivering our equipment, unable to install our equipment on aircraft by specified timelines or fail to comply with service level commitments. The maximum amount of future credits or payments we could be required to make under these agreements is uncertain because the amount of future credits or payments is based on certain variable inputs. Indemnifications and Guarantees In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors and Officers insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of the performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements, including our agreements with commercial airlines, pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. 146 Linksmart Litigation On April 20, 2018, Linksmart Wireless Technology, LLC filed suit against us and eight of our airline partners in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that our redirection server and login portal infringe a patent owned by the plaintiff. The suits seek an unspecified amount of damages. We are required under our contracts with these airlines to indemnify them for defense costs and any liabilities resulting from the suit. The Court has stayed the suits against our airline customers pending resolution of the suit against Gogo. Linksmart has also filed suit against other defendants asserting the same patent. Following the filing by one of those defendants of a petition to commence an inter partes review against the asserted patent in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Court stayed the litigation against such other defendant and Gogo, but such stay was lifted in July 2019 when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office determined that the petitioner had not met the standard of proof required to commence the inter partes review. We believe that the plaintiffs claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. The outcome of this litigation is inherently uncertain. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Securities Litigation On June 27, 2018, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division styled Pierrelouis v. Gogo Inc., naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation as defendants purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our securities from February 27, 2017 through May 4, 2018. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, alleging misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to our 2Ku antennas reliability and installation and remediation costs. The plaintiffs seek to recover from us and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages. In December 2018 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and in February 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss such amended complaint. In October 2019 the judge granted the motion to dismiss on two independent grounds, finding that plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that defendants made materially false or misleading statements and that plaintiffs failed to plead with particularity that defendants acted with scienter. The amended complaint was dismissed without prejudice, and in December 2019, defendants filed a second amended complaint. In February 2020 we filed a motion to dismiss such second amended complaint and that motion is pending. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. In accordance with Delaware law, we will indemnify the individual named defendants for their defense costs and any damages they incur in connection with the suit. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors and Officers insurance policy with respect to this suit. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Derivative Litigation On September 25, 2018 and September 26, 2018, two purported stockholders of the Company filed substantively identical derivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, styled Nanduri v. Gogo Inc. and Hutsenpiller v. Gogo Inc., respectively. Both lawsuits were purportedly brought derivatively on behalf of us and name us as a nominal defendant and name as defendants each member of the Companys Board of Directors, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and allege misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to our 2Ku antennas reliability and installation and remediation costs, as well as allegedly excessive bonuses, stock options, and other compensation paid to current Officers and Directors and excessive severance paid to former Officers. The two lawsuits were consolidated and are stayed until a final disposition of the motion to dismiss in the class action suit. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously if the litigation resumes. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on our behalf, an unspecified amount of damages from the individual defendants. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors and Officers insurance policy with respect to these suits. No amounts have been accrued for any potential costs under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential costs. 147 17.

Subsequent Events In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China which has resulted in global travel restrictions and the suspension of certain commercial flights by some of our airline partners, which has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our CA business. In recent weeks, we have seen significantly reduced demand on aircraft operated in the Asia Pacific region as compared to demand levels in January 2020 before COVID-19 affected travel. More recently, demand for both business and leisure airline travel on a global basis has declined significantly due to COVID-19, and airlines are responding by cancelling additional flights, including domestic U.S. flights. All of our U.S. airline partners have announced international and domestic capacity reductions, and in the week in which this report is being filed, we are seeing for the first time reduced demand on domestic U.S. flights as a result of COVID-19. In addition, on March 11, 2020 the President of the United States announced a 30-day suspension of travel from 26 European countries to the U.S. and similar or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions could further materially impact business and leisure airline travel. We expect COVID-19 to continue to have a significant negative impact on CA revenue and are unable to predict how long that impact will continue. To date, we have not seen any impact of COVID-19 on our BA business. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the CA and BA businesses and our financial and 150 operational performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the duration and geographic scope of related travel advisories and restrictions and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on overall demand for commercial and business aviation travel, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. If our airline partners continue to experience significantly reduced demand for passenger traffic for an extended period, our 2020 consolidated results of operations and our liquidity and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. The extent to which the outbreak affects our earnings and liquidity will depend in part on our ability to implement various measures intended to reduce expenses and/or conserve cash. Earnings in CA-ROW may be particularly affected if reduced demand for travel continues, as we provide service in that segment solely via satellite-based systems and satellite capacity and certain other costs are largely fixed. Further, travel and other restrictions adopted in response to COVID-19 may impact our ability to complete installations on certain aircraft and successfully operate our services on aircraft that operate in regions affected by the coronavirus, particularly where travel is restricted. Additionally, our suppliers or other third parties we rely upon to install and maintain our services may experience delays or shortages, which could have an adverse effect on our business prospects and results of operations. 151 Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2019 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019. (b) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Gogo Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a  15(f) and 15d  15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Gogos internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The management of Gogo, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have assessed the effectiveness of Gogos internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, the Companys management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, which report is included on Page 153 of this Form 10-K under the caption entitled Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no material changes to our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Other Information None. 152 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Gogo Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Gogo Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated March 13, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph related to the Companys adoption of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , effective January 1, 2018 and the adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases , effective January 1, 2019. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Chicago, Illinois March 13, 2020 153 Part III Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.

These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding our industry, business strategy, plans, goals and expectations concerning our market position, international expansion, future technologies, future operations, margins, profitability, future efficiencies, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources and other financial and operating information. When used in this discussion, the words anticipate, assume, believe, budget, continue, could, estimate, expect, forecast, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, will, future and the negative of these or similar terms and phrases are intended to identify forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise. Business Who We Are Gogo is the in-flight Internet company. Our mission is to provide ground-like connectivity to every device on every flight around the globe, enabling superior passenger experiences and efficient flight operations. To accomplish our mission, we design, build and operate dedicated satellite and air-to-ground (ATG) networks, engineer, install and maintain in-flight systems of proprietary hardware and software, and deliver customizable connectivity and wireless entertainment services and global support capabilities to our aviation partners. We are the leading global provider of in-flight broadband connectivity and wireless entertainment services, with our equipment installed and services provided on approximately 3,100 commercial aircraft and approximately 5,200 business aircraft as of December 31, 2018. Our industry is characterized by rapid technological development, and we continually invest in research and development to maintain our leading global market share and support our aviation partners needs. Since we announced our next-generation 2Ku global satellite system (2Ku) in 2014, fourteen domestic and international airlines have selected 2Ku for installation, and as of December 31, 2018, our 2Ku system had been installed on more than 1,000 aircraft with approximately 1,000 additional 2Ku aircraft in backlog (as defined below under the heading Contracts with Airline Partners). Of the aircraft installed with 2Ku as of December 31, 2018, approximately 520 were upgrades from currently-installed Gogo systems. The 2Ku system is currently capable of delivering peak speeds of 100 Mbps to the aircraft. We also continue to innovate and improve our North American terrestrial networks. We have been working for several years on development and testing of an upgraded ATG network that employs 2.4 2 GHz of unlicensed spectrum, and this network has achieved a ten-fold increase from the speed of our current ATG-4 system (ATG-4). We have not made a decision to proceed with implementation of the 2.4 GHz solution, and due to uncertainty regarding the possible effect of U.S. government security concerns on our development partners ability to continue to serve us, we are exploring other solutions for upgrading and increasing the capacity of the current ATG network. All of the solutions we are considering would enable us to leverage our existing ATG network as well as our data centers, core system software, network operating center and network staff. Our leading global market share supports our continued investment in ongoing research and development and the global operating capabilities required to support our aviation partners needs. Our technology roadmap includes plans for continued rapid improvement in bandwidth speeds and other performance metrics of our in-flight systems.

As of such date, BA also had 4,869 aircraft online equipped with Iridium, a lower bandwidth global satellite solution. 3 Our In-flight Internet Portfolio We focus exclusively on aviation and implement our value proposition of offering the best products and services through a comprehensive portfolio consisting of our in-flight network, in-flight systems, in-flight services, and aviation partner support. In-flight Network . Our network solutions are engineered to provide industry-leading cost, capacity, coverage, reliability and aero-performance. We offer aviation partners a variety of network solutions suitable for operation on most of the worlds commercial and business aircraft. We market our global satellite network solutions to approximately 21,000 commercial aircraft. Our terrestrial network targets approximately 1,700 commercial regional jets and approximately 23,000 business aircraft. Approximately two-thirds of all business aircraft and regional commercial aircraft currently in operation are based in North America. Such aircraft generally fly over land and are well-suited for our ATG solutions given their smaller antenna, lighter weight and reduced equipment and operating costs (including fuel). Global Satellite Network : We operate a global Ku-band satellite network comprised of 28 satellites operated by SES, Intelsat and other providers and 17 teleports operated by Gogo. The capacity, speed, coverage and reliability of this network are continually improved by incorporating new satellites, including high throughput satellites (HTS), five of which we are already using. We also anticipate incorporating new satellite technologies that have yet to come online, such as low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Our 2Ku and Ku in-flight systems operate on this network. North American Terrestrial Network : We operate a terrestrial network using 3MHz of licensed spectrum in the 850 MHz band and approximately 260 terrestrial cell sites in the lower 48 states and parts of Alaska and Canada. As of December 31, 2018, this network supported 3.1 Mbps ATG service and 9.8 Mbps ATG-4 service to CA and BA aircraft. We are currently considering a number of technological solutions that would enable us to upgrade the existing network. Ground Network : We lease an extensive, predominantly fiber-optic network to connect our approximately 260 cell sites and 17 teleports to our three data centers, the Internet and cloud-based services, and our network operations center (NOC). Our data centers and cloud-based services provide redundant telecommunications connections to the Internet and contain numerous servers that enable the expansive set of features offered through the Gogo platform. The NOC monitors daily network operations, conducts network diagnostics and coordinates responses to any performance issues on the ground or in the air. We augment our ability to monitor, maintain and update our in-flight systems while aircraft are on the ground with a terrestrial modem utilizing 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi wireless service. In-flight Systems . To utilize our in-flight network and provide our in-flight services, we have developed proprietary systems of airborne equipment and software. Our in-flight systems are designed for superior performance, future adaptability and ease of certification, installation and maintenance. Each system consists of: (i) an antenna specifically designed for the network and technology being used to provide the service; (ii) a modular in-cabin Wi-Fi network that includes state-of-the art servers, modems and wireless access points; and (iii) system software designed to reliably support a variety of in-flight services provided by Gogo, our aviation partners and third parties. Our 2Ku system employs a modular, open architecture that is adaptable to current and future satellites of multiple types provided by multiple satellite providers, supports different modems and is upgradeable with minimum disruption to the flight schedules and operations of our aviation partners. In-flight Services . We provide a wide range of in-flight services for passengers, flight and cabin crews and operational use by our aviation partners. We leverage our increased bandwidth to expand our connectivity and entertainment services. Passenger Connectivity Services . Passengers connect to the Internet from their personal electronic devices, as they would on the ground, to access corporate and personal applications that include streaming services on our higher capacity networks. Our continued increases in bandwidth enable us to serve more passengers 4 per flight. In CA, passengers may select from a variety of pricing options tailored to devices, routes, available bandwidth and session durations, in addition to monthly and annual subscriptions. In BA, we offer a variety of connectivity services tailored to our various networks and technologies that are generally priced per aircraft per month. Passenger connectivity services are and will continue to be a significant source of our revenue. Passenger Entertainment Services . Through Gogo Vision, our video-on-demand product accessible from passengers personal electronic devices, commercial and business aircraft passengers can access a large library of entertainment options, which currently include on-demand movies and television shows. Through Gogo TV, we deliver live television content to passengers on satellite-equipped flights using our in-cabin network. As of December 31, 2018, Gogo Vision was available on 2,200 aircraft and Gogo TV was available on more than 700 aircraft. In addition, we and Delta Air Lines collaborated in developing Gogo Vision Touch our new wireless seatback product that enables passengers to stream entertainment and other content to a tablet mounted on the seatback. We expect that Gogo Vision Touch will begin commercial service in the first quarter of 2019. Connected Aircraft Services . Using our Connected Aircraft Services (CAS), our aviation partners can access connectivity-based, data-oriented applications designed to improve the flying experience and enhance the operational efficiency of our airline partners by leveraging the connectivity we provide to the aircraft. CAS provides value by capturing key data from aircraft sensors, databases and crew inputs and combining it with data coming from the ground to provide comprehensive and real-time visibility into operations. For example, CAS currently supports route optimization, turbulence avoidance, electronic flight bag (EFB) applications, real-time credit card processing and weather data. In October 2018, we partnered with GOL to launch our Aircraft Data Service, Wireless Quick Access Recorder and Automated Turbulence Reporting, which analyzes and integrates aircraft and EFB data to provide GOL with real-time access to turbulence and other information. Similarly, in October 2018, our BA segment introduced Gogo DASH, a mobile application that gives airborne personnel real-time visibility into their Gogo systems during flight and provides them with key information to help diagnose and resolve an issue by working with their ground operations teams and Gogo customer support. Aviation Partner Support . Account Team . Each CA airline has a dedicated Gogo account team that provides assistance during the certification and installation process and throughout the term of our partnership. BA has a customer operations team that assists our dealers with installation, troubleshooting and system activations, and its flight department is supported by field service engineering teams located at key locations across the United States and Europe. Both the dealer network and flight department have access to our technical and logistical support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Operational Support . We provide a variety of services required to install and maintain our in-flight systems. In CA, our experienced technical engineers do the engineering work necessary to certify and install our equipment on commercial aircraft of all major models and work with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and international regulators to obtain Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs) and other required approvals. Our installation technicians work with airline partners or third parties to assist in installation, which can be completed overnight for our terrestrial network systems and in less than 48 hours for our satellite systems. In our BA business, we support the certification and installation functions of our customers. Supply chain organizations in CA and BA receive, inspect, test, warehouse, kit and ship materials. Following installation, our NOC continually monitors the network, and its usage and performance. We operate a 24/7 maintenance coordination and scheduling service and perform or support maintenance for aviation partners at a variety of U.S. and international locations. Comprehensive Analytics . We have extensive databases, a big data platform and analytical capabilities to evaluate our system and operational performance. Our analytical capabilities are used by us, our aviation partners and our vendors in designing, manufacturing, and operating our systems to maximize performance and minimize disruptions and system downtime. 5 Competitive Strengths We maintain the leading global market position in connectivity for each of the CA and BA markets. We have designed our value proposition to align with our aviation partners priorities and we believe that our comprehensive product and service portfolio sets us apart from competitors by better meeting customer needs through: Leading Performance . Our networks and systems are designed to provide the best in-flight Internet experience and highest network and system availability across the broadest range of aircraft wherever they fly. We offer the broadest array of in-flight connectivity technologies in the market, including our proprietary 2Ku, Ku, ATG-4/ATG, AVANCE L5 and AVANCE L3 systems. We are the only in-flight connectivity provider to offer both ATG and satellite-based solutions and our satellite network offers the most comprehensive global coverage in our industry. The breadth of our technologies allows our customers to select the best solution based on aircraft size and route  serving everything from smaller BA aircraft to the largest widebody CA aircraft. With the addition of our next-generation modem and the addition of more HTSs to our network, 2Ku is capable of delivering peak speeds to the aircraft of 100 Mbps. 2Ku enables end users to enjoy a ground-like experience, including streaming and other bandwidth-intensive applications. It employs two low-profile satellite antennas with higher spectral efficiency, superior equatorial performance, and lower drag and fuel burn as compared to competing satellite antennas. Continuous Innovation . We design our solutions to provide leading performance and to last for many years, as evidenced by our 2Ku system. The 2Ku system is designed to access maximum satellite capacity, and its open, modular architecture enables us to obtain satellite capacity from multiple existing and anticipated satellites operated by multiple providers, thereby enabling our aviation partners to offer leading performance for many years without the need for antenna swaps or other invasive changes to the aircraft. This open architecture is facilitated by our proprietary antenna system and our investments in modem and antenna positioner hardware and software. The 2Ku architecture is designed to enable adoption of new technologies in the future while minimizing the impact of hardware changes on aircraft. Our strategy does not include owning or operating satellites. By leasing satellite capacity, we maximize our flexibility to adopt rapid innovations in satellites and to obtain capacity when, where and in the amount required by our aviation customers. We expect continued rapid innovation in satellites to yield improved global coverage and redundancy, increased capacity and peak speed, and lower latency. With approximately 80% of the commercial air traffic concentrated in less than 20% of the global airspace, our multi-provider, multi-satellite approach most efficiently matches supply with demand. We continue to innovate and have a strong track record. We pioneered and have led innovation in our industry for more than 25 years, as evidenced by the nine network technologies, six of which are proprietary to Gogo, that we have deployed during this time. In addition, we hold more than 200 U.S. and international patents, most of which relate to network technology. In addition to exploring possible technologies that would enable us to upgrade our ATG network, we are currently researching and developing a fully electronic phased array antenna as well as activities that relate to the use of LEO satellite capacity. Customer-Focus . We provide a hardware and software platform that allows connectivity-enabled services to be deployed quickly, easily and flexibly across all of our networks. Gogo supports airline partners with customized portals and applications. These portals are managed by Gogo, airlines or third parties that rely on Gogos platform for many functions, including user accounts and passwords, payments, entertainment and other stored content. These capabilities are common regardless of which network the aircraft operates on, enabling our airline partners to bring their customized user experiences to their full fleets. We offer various levels of customization based on our airline partners needs, ranging from a look and feel consistent with the airlines branding to fully customized portals designed to provide unique passenger experiences based on the airlines specifications. 6 We are continually engaged in enhancing our services in order to enhance the user experience. For example, we employ sophisticated network management techniques intended to improve the user experience by ensuring that sufficient bandwidth is available for various services such as messaging, browsing and streaming. In addition, our captive portal enables us to develop system improvements that improve the user experience by streamlining the sign-on process and making it easier for users to access our IFC service. Our AVANCE system provides BA customers with a common software platform that operates across all Gogo networks and allows aviation partners to customize their passengers in-flight experiences by selecting from a variety of offerings that include various levels of connectivity; on-demand entertainment; information and applications; smart cabin customization; and real-time support and tools. The flexibility of the AVANCE system enables BA owners and operators to add or reduce system capabilities as their needs change. Additionally, both our CA and BA platforms provide hosting, reporting, data labels, storage and other capabilities for an increasing array of CAS applications from a variety of third-party partners. Long-Term Support . There are unique requirements that separate aviation from terrestrial markets and we have the necessary scale and expertise to address this market. Gogo supports the largest fleet of connected aircraft and we have acquired significant technological and operational expertise and developed long-term and robust supplier relationships in both business and commercial aviation. In commercial aviation, we have the capability to install ATG equipment overnight and satellite solutions in less than two days, and to deploy software upgrades remotely. As of December 31, 2018, we were operating 28 installation lines and 16 installation locations around the globe. After installation, our support continues and in 2018, we provided maintenance services for customer aircraft that flew more than 4.8 million flights to or from six continents. Airlines are increasingly assuming responsibility for equipment maintenance and we are leveraging our experience to support them, including by training them in best practices. Growth Strategy The four key drivers fueling Gogos growth and financial performance are: increasing the number of Gogo-connected aircraft, increasing average revenue per aircraft, reducing investment per aircraft and improving margins. Increase Number of Gogo-Connected Aircraft Less than half of the global fleet of approximately 22,500 commercial aircraft and 30,700 business aircraft are currently broadband connected. We expect that nearly all of the worlds commercial aircraft and a rapidly increasing percentage of business aircraft will be broadband connected over the next decade. These new connections will increasingly occur on new aircraft through the OEM channel. Commercial Aviation . As of December 31, 2018, we provided our connectivity services on 3,140 commercial aircraft. Based on the strength of our comprehensive portfolio, we expect to continue to sign contracts with airlines to equip existing and new aircraft. During 2018, the following aircraft were delivered through the OEM channel with our 2Ku system: Airbus A350; Boeing 787-9 and Bombardier A220. Business Aviation . As of December 31, 2018, the business aviation market was comprised of approximately 23,000 business aircraft in North America and approximately 7,700 business aircraft in the rest of the world, and we had approximately 5,200 business aircraft online with broadband connectivity, principally in North America. We increased our number of broadband business aircraft online by more than 500 in 2018. A significant number of BA aircraft are new aircraft on which our systems are installed and sold by OEMs, including Beechcraft, Bombardier, Cessna, Dassault Falcon, Embraer, Gulfstream, and Learjet. Since 2017, we have offered our customers AVANCE L5, an integrated and customizable in-flight system that employs our ATG-4 network in North America and is faster than our Gogo Biz solution. In 2018, we introduced 7 AVANCE L3, a more compact integrated, customizable in-flight system that uses our ATG network and is targeted at light jets and turbo props in North America and we announced a new global Ku-based satellite solution for larger, long range business jets, which is expected to be commercially available in 2020. By leveraging networks shared with CA, we now have in-flight systems that address nearly all segments of the business aviation market. Our ability to provide CAS and our flexibility in providing various pricing options further support our strategy of targeting various segments of the market. Increase Average Revenue per Aircraft We expect to continue to grow net annualized average monthly service revenue per aircraft equivalent (ARPA) by increasing the take rates for passenger connectivity and the adoption of additional services, including entertainment and CAS. Our strategies for growing net annualized ARPA include the following: Increase Passenger Adoption of Connectivity . We intend to leverage our existing technology and our technology roadmap to continue to enhance the passenger experience and the number and quality of available services. Our mission is to provide all passengers on every flight a ground-like experience, including video streaming. We expect to engage additional passengers and grow net annualized ARPA through a combination of multiple tiers of service and multiple payers. In BA, we continue to introduce a variety of broadband and voice services and related pricing plans, allowing aircraft operators and owners various options based on data usage, flight frequency and the number and size of aircraft serviced. In CA, the increased bandwidth of 2Ku supports tiered services such as messaging, browsing and streaming and enables a variety of experiences and price points for passengers. Airlines provide amenities to passengers using segmentation based on cabin seating, ticket prices and other factors, and we expect our service revenue from airlines to grow as they increasingly purchase bandwidth to provide complimentary service for some or all of their passengers. We also expect to continue to receive service revenue from third parties. For example, we are currently engaged by T-Mobile to make our in-flight services available to its subscribers, and we expect other terrestrial mobile carriers and other companies, such as credit card providers, to enter into similar arrangements. Increase Adoption of Wireless Entertainment . Gogo Vision was available on nearly all Gogo-connected aircraft in CA and approximately 660 BA aircraft as of December 31, 2018. Through our Gogo Vision platform, airlines offer passengers a library of movies and TV shows for wireless streaming to personal devices. By December 31, 2018, all of our airline customers had transitioned from the Gogo Vision passenger-paid model to a free-to-passenger model under which the airlines pay Gogo on a monthly basis and/or per view basis. Due in part to this transition, Gogo Vision views doubled from 2016 to 2017 and increased by 25% in 2018 to more than 50 million views. We expect wireless entertainment views to continue to grow, driven by increased awareness of the service, availability of additional content, increased use of Gogo TV (which delivers live content streamed directly to wireless devices), and the launch of Gogo Vision Touch, our seatback tablet screen technology developed in collaboration with Delta Air Lines. Increase Adoption of CAS. We expect that the demand by airlines for connectivity-based applications that improve the passenger experience and operational efficiency will increase over the next several years. This trend will drive data usage on our network and demand for platform services from Gogo. We are interfacing our equipment with the data buses on aircraft and are developing the hardware and software platforms that facilitate the development and deployment of applications. CAS currently supports aircraft crew devices and enables pilots and crew to utilize the following services: location tracking, aircraft data analytics, route optimization, turbulence avoidance, EFB applications, real-time credit card processing and weather data. Reduce Our Investment per Aircraft In CA, we define investment per aircraft as the installed cost of airborne equipment less the proceeds received from an airline partner. Our investment per aircraft varies depending on the commercial terms of our 8 contract with the airline, the technology deployed, and the type of aircraft equipment installed. We are leveraging our experience in reducing installation times to assist our airline partners and their installers in conducting installations as quickly and efficiently as possible. Our ability to leverage our growing portfolio of STCs will further reduce the cost and time required to install new fleets. We have a broad portfolio of STCs and service bulletins for aircraft types to be equipped with 2Ku, which allows us to reuse STCs to reduce the time and cost required to obtain certification and to accelerate installation schedules. As of December 31, 2018, we had STCs to support 90% of the installations we plan to complete in 2019. In addition, as 2Kus performance and consumer appeal have been demonstrated, the price paid by airline partners for our airborne equipment has increased compared to 2Kus launch pricing. As our investment per aircraft declines and net annualized ARPA increases, our return on invested capital increases and the payback period is shortened. Improve Margins We have made substantial investments in our network, in-flight systems, in-flight service platforms and aviation partner support in order to serve aircraft operators globally. As we increase the number of aircraft online, particularly in CA-ROW, we expect to achieve benefits of scale as we have in CA-NA. In addition, by executing our Integrated Business Plan (IBP), Gogo 2020, which was designed to improve our operational and financial performance by reducing our cost structure, improving quality, increasing revenue and streamlining business processes, we expect our margins to improve. We also anticipate continued decreases in satellite costs which, together with our bandwidth management capabilities, are expected to contribute to margin improvement. Contracts with Airline Partners In CA, we enter into connectivity agreements with our airline partners under which the airlines commit to have our equipment installed on some or all of the aircraft they operate, and we commit to provide passenger connectivity and/or entertainment services, and, in some circumstances, CAS, on such aircraft. We currently have definitive agreements with 18 commercial airlines. We have the exclusive right to provide Internet connectivity services on Gogo-installed aircraft throughout the term of the agreement in contracts with airline partners from which we derived a substantial majority of our consolidated revenue in 2018. The majority of our contracts with our airline partners have 10-year terms, with staggered expiration dates occurring on a fleet-by-fleet basis based on installation dates or on a contract basis, depending on the contract. Under our current contracts, the first expiration will occur in 2019 and the last in 2029 or later, depending on the timing of future installations. We offer airline partners a variety of business models and work with each airline to tailor the model to meet its needs. We began our CA business with the turnkey model, under which we provide the airline with the full range of our services, charge the passenger for passenger connectivity or Gogo Vision services at prices we determine and remit to the airline a specified percentage of passenger revenue. Under such model, for satellite-based connectivity services, the airline typically pays Gogo a monthly fee for network monitoring and management services. Under some of our agreements, airlines have adopted or have the option to adopt an airline-directed model, whereby the airline partner has flexibility to determine which of the many end-to-end services it wants Gogo to provide, which services it wants to provide itself and how it wishes to price the services provided to passengers. For example, an airline may elect to be the retailer for in-flight connectivity and entertainment services to its passengers, rather than using Gogo as the distributor, or to offer our services on a complimentary basis to some or all of its passengers. In such case, we negotiate the fees the airline pays us for the connectivity and entertainment services provided, the bandwidth consumed, and any other services provided by Gogo. Depending on the contract, installation and maintenance services may be performed by us and/or the airline. When we provide such services, under some agreements, we include charges for installation and maintenance in our equipment pricing package; in other circumstances, the airline pays us directly for such services. Under certain contracts, we provide equipment credits or other incentives based on the number of aircraft installed with 9 our equipment and the timing of such installations. Our contracts with airline partners set forth specified timelines for the installation or delivery of our airborne equipment, as well as service level commitments, and our failure to meet such timelines or service level commitments generally requires us to pay penalties or liquidated damages to the airlines and in certain circumstances may result in our airline partners being permitted to terminate all or a portion of the contract. As of December 31, 2018, inflight entertainment (IFE), which includes Gogo Vision, Gogo TV or Gogo Vision Touch, was included in the scope of services under agreements with ten of our airline partners and we are discussing with other airline partners the possibility of providing IFE on their installed fleets. We also provide certain airline partners with CAS, such as real-time credit card processing for passenger food and beverage purchases, flight crew access to real-time weather information, EFB applications and voice services in the cockpit. Revenue from service provided on aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines accounted for approximately 23% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 (equipment revenue from Delta Air Lines was immaterial due to the fact that equipment transactions under the turnkey model are not considered a sale for accounting purposes). We have three principal contracts with Delta Air Lines. The contract for ATG service on Delta Air Lines mainline and regional jet fleets expires on the 13-year anniversary of specified installation milestones, which will occur in 2022 and 2027, respectively. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines for Ku-band satellite service on its international fleet and for 2Ku service will expire in 2027. Revenue from service and equipment provided on aircraft operated by American Airlines accounted for approximately 22% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 (such revenue included equipment revenue recognized in January 2018 when American Airlines transitioned from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model). On February 24, 2017, we replaced our multiple contracts with American Airlines (including the contract originally entered into with US Airways) with one unified agreement (the Unified Agreement) covering aircraft installed or to be installed with our ATG and ATG-4 technologies and to be installed with our 2Ku technology. The Unified Agreement has different expiration dates for different fleet types. Generally, the term for each fleet type, other than those on which 2Ku will be installed, expires on the 10-year anniversary of the date on which 90% of such fleet type has been installed with our ATG equipment, or when the fleet types are retired or deinstalled. The termination dates for such fleet types (excluding retirements) range from 2022 to 2025. The Unified Agreement will terminate with respect to the 2Ku fleet on October 1, 2019. Each of our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines provides for early termination by the airline in specified circumstances and allows the airline to terminate the contract should the percentage of passengers using the Gogo service on the airlines flights not meet certain thresholds. We currently experience, and for the last five years have experienced, connectivity take rates in excess of those thresholds. In addition, under the Unified Agreement, American Airlines has the option to terminate Gogo service, and as expected, it exercised such option on approximately 550 mainline aircraft on which our ATG/ATG-4 service has been provided. Of such aircraft, 374 were deinstalled in 2018 (primarily in the second half of the year) with the balance expected to be deinstalled in the first half of 2019. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also permit these airlines to terminate their contracts prior to expiration upon the occurrence of other certain contractually stipulated events, including our failure to meet service level requirements and the circumstance in which another company provides an alternate connectivity service that is a material improvement over our passenger connectivity service, such that failing to adopt such service would likely cause competitive harm to the airline, and we are unable to match the competitive offer in terms of price, technology and schedule. Our contracts with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines also permit the airline to terminate the agreement for convenience with respect to certain fleets on or after specified dates, subject to payment of a specified termination fee. No other contract accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 10 As of December 31, 2018, and we had approximately 1,000 CA aircraft on which we expected to install our 2Ku system under existing contracts and awards not yet under contract, which we refer to as backlog. Our backlog includes current aircraft online that are being upgraded to 2Ku. Our backlog may be impacted by a number of factors including decisions by airlines to exercise their contractual rights to have aircraft installed or deinstalled with our equipment, as a result of changes in fleet plans or otherwise. As backlog is based on various estimates and assumptions of management, we can provide no assurance that our backlog is indicative of future aircraft online. Competition Commercial Aviation Our key competitors include Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Inmarsat, SITAONAIR, Panasonic Avionics Corp., Collins Aerospace, Thales, ViaSat and Zodiac Inflight Innovations, all of which provide different technologies and strategies to provide in-flight connectivity and/or entertainment. We are the only telecommunications company focused exclusively on in-flight connectivity and in-flight entertainment and their unique requirements. We believe that our competitive advantages include the breadth of our technological solutions, our global coverage, our operational excellence, the variety of business models we offer to airlines and, increasingly, our ability to offer equipment through the OEM channel. The strategic priorities, offerings and capabilities of our competitors vary, including the variety of technologies available for various aircraft types, the ability to offer in-flight Internet solutions and video entertainment offerings, the ability to cost-effectively provide offerings on a global basis, the ability to manage capacity constraints, and the ability to offer, incorporate and manage new in-flight connectivity technologies and solutions as they become available. Business Aviation We compete against both equipment and telecommunications service providers to the business aviation market, including Honeywell Aerospace, Collins Aerospace, Satcom Direct and ViaSat. Also, Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., Panasonic Avionics Corp. and SmartSky Networks have announced that they intend to enter the business aviation market. Licenses and Regulation Federal Aviation Administration The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. We regularly obtain STCs for each aircraft type operated by each airline partner on whose aircraft our equipment will be installed and separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different airlines. After obtaining an STC, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a Parts Manufacturer Approval, or PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facilitys production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements. 11 Certain of our FCC licenses are conditioned upon our ability to obtain from the FAA a No Hazard Determination for our cell sites, which indicates that a proposed structure will not, if built as specified, create a hazard to air navigation. When building or altering certain cell sites, we may first be required to obtain such a determination. Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified engineering and other professionals. In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures, and quality control systems continue to meet FAA requirements. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities or on aircraft. Foreign Aviation Regulation According to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the airworthiness of U.S.-registered and FAA type-certificated aircraft on which FAA-certified Gogo equipment is installed is recognized by civil aviation authorities (CAAs) worldwide that are signatories to that Convention. As a result, Gogo does not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering Gogo equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA other than the United States, the installation of Gogo equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority. The FAA holds bilateral agreements with a number of certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement (BAA) or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement (BASA) with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart CAA. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircrafts country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a Validation Supplemental Type Certificate. For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, Gogo must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification, Gogo will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each airline partners service in any country in which it registers aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on our airline partners fleets. U.S. Department of Transportation The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) established an Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transport to negotiate and develop a proposed rule concerning accommodations for passengers with disabilities in three basic areas, including IFE and closed captioning of IFE. The Committee issued a resolution in late 2016 which included its recommendations to the DOT for a rule on IFE. Since a final rule on IFE has not been issued, however, it is unclear how, if at all, it may impact Gogo. Federal Communications Commission Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), the FCC licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless operations. 12 The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCCs prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of Gogo by non-U.S. individuals or entities. Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. For example, our BA business provides some of its voice and data services (not including Gogo Biz or AVANCE) by reselling the telecommunications services of two satellite operators. Because we provide these services on a common carrier basis, we are subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory. In addition, our BA segment provides an interconnected voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service. The FCC applies many, but not all, of the same regulatory requirements to interconnected VoIP service as it does to common carrier telecommunications services. We offer connectivity service in the United States to commercial and business aviation aircraft through our own facilities, using our ATG License, a nationwide commercial air-ground radiotelephone license that operates in the 800 MHz band. We obtained and paid for this spectrum through an auction conducted by the FCC. See ATG License Terms and Conditions. In June 12, 2015, our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services became classified as Title II telecommunications services, subject to FCC common carrier regulation and broad net neutrality rules pursuant to an FCC order released March 12, 2015 (the Open Internet Order). The Open Internet Order prohibited broadband providers from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contained an exception for reasonable network management. However, on January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order (the Restoring Internet Freedom Order) that repealed most of the Open Internet Order, reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a lightly regulated, non-common carrier information service, and removed virtually all of the compliance obligations that the Open Internet Order imposes on our mobile wireless broadband Internet access services. The Restoring Internet Freedom Order went into effect on June 11, 2018. Under the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, Gogo may remain subject to certain modified transparency obligations that require disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms. Our Internet access service is also subject to the FCCs data roaming rules, which require commercial mobile data service (CMDS) providers like Gogo to negotiate roaming arrangements with any requesting facilities-based, technologically compatible providers of CMDS. The rules do not give other providers the right to install equipment on Gogo-equipped aircraft, and do not require the Gogo service to be provided on a discounted basis, although the arrangement must be commercially reasonable. The rules allow us to take reasonable measures to safeguard the quality of our service against network congestion that may result from roaming traffic. Neither the Open Internet Order nor the Restoring Internet Freedom Order altered Gogos obligations with respect to data roaming, but the FCC has committed to revisiting data roaming rules in the future. In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible to persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content offered through our Gogo Vision service. In addition to the two ATG licenses, we hold other FCC licenses, including microwave licenses that are used for backhaul in our terrestrial network, one fixed satellite earth station license used for network testing and 13 support, one experimental license used for testing equipment, two aircraft radio licenses, and an authorization for the provision of voice and data services between the United States and foreign points. We also hold a license for blanket authority to operate Ku-band satellite transceivers on up to 2,000 aircraft, which allows us to provide domestic and international broadband service (although some countries require additional authorizations of their own). ATG License Terms and Conditions The FCC issued our ATG License on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term. We have satisfied our obligation under the license to provide substantial service to aircraft, and on January 25, 2017, we received confirmation from the FCC that the license has been renewed until October 31, 2026. Our 1 MHz ATG license obtained in 2013 from LiveTV was also originally issued on October 31, 2006, for a renewable 10-year term, although there is no substantial service obligation that attaches to this license. Our application to renew our license was subsequently granted for an additional 10-year term. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revised the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is not currently clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. Our two ATG licenses contain certain conditions that require us to comply with all applicable FCC and FAA rules as well as all bilateral agreements between the United States and Canada and the United States and Mexico regarding the frequencies that are allocated for ATG services. These agreements apply to our use of the spectrum in areas adjacent to the United States northern and southern borders and in and out of Canadian and Mexican airspace. A bilateral ATG spectrum coordination agreement between the U.S. and Canada has been negotiated and approved and a bilateral agreement between the United States and Mexico is still pending. In 2012, Industry Canada issued to our Canadian subsidiary a subordinate license that allows us to use Canadian ATG spectrum of which SkySurf Communications Inc. is the primary licensee. In 2012, we entered into the License Agreement with SkySurf, which has an initial term of ten years commencing on August 14, 2012, and, provided that the primary spectrum license agreement issued by Industry Canada (now Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada or ISED) to SkySurf remains in effect at such dates, is renewable at our option for an additional 10-year term following the initial expiration and thereafter for a further five-year term. The term of the License Agreement, including the initial 10-year term and any renewals, is contingent on the effectiveness and renewal of the primary spectrum license, issued by Industry Canada to SkySurf on June 30, 2009, which was to expire on June 29, 2019. Following a consultation regarding renewal of the ATG license, ISED renewed SkySurfs ATG license for an eight-year term commencing June 29, 2019. Any future coordination agreement with Mexico and/or a Mexican ATG licensee could affect our ability to provide our broadband Internet service in the border areas using our current cell sites at current operating power levels and could affect our ability to establish or maintain ATG service in the border areas as aircraft fly into and out of Mexican airspace. Once a provider of ATG services is licensed in Mexico, we hope to negotiate an arrangement that will provide seamless connectivity on flights between Mexico and the United States. Equipment Certification We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of CA or BA services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCCs technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained. 14 Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations Notwithstanding the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, which reclassified broadband Internet access as a Title I information service, we must continue to comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Although the FTCs authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by communications common carriers has not been clearly delineated, FTC officials have publicly stated that they view the FTC as having jurisdiction over Internet service providers non-common carrier services, and we believe that the FTC has jurisdiction over all of our services. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that among other things: (1) collect, use, share, or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the companys actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information. We collect personally identifiable information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our service. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties. We use the information that we collect to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection and use of such information is intended to comply with our privacy policy, which is posted on our website, applicable law and our contractual obligations to airlines, BA customers and other third parties, as well as industry standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also subject to state mini-FTC Acts, which also prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state. Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, on September 23, 2018, the governor of California signed into law an amended version of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA). The CCPA provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA will also impose compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including, among others, notice, consent, and data retention requirements. It will take effect on January 1, 2020. While we believe that we have implemented reasonable administrative, physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information, cyber-attacks on companies have increased in frequency and potential impact in recent years and may be successful despite reasonable precautions and result in substantial potential liabilities. As we expand our operations to include a physical international presence, or otherwise expand our collection of personally identifiable information of residents in other countries, we may be subject to the data protection regulations of the relevant countries. On May 25, 2018, the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect, which has imposed more restrictive privacy-related requirements for entities outside the European Union that process personally identifiable information about European data subjects. In 15 addition, certain countries have laws which restrict the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of such countries. For example, both Switzerland and the member states of the European Union impose restrictions on transferring such data to countries, including the United States, that they do not deem to offer a similar standard of protection as they require. Certain mechanisms apply under Swiss and European Union member state laws that permit the cross-border transfer of personal information to countries that are not deemed adequate, such as the United States. Gogo has entered into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Union and Switzerland to legitimize these transfers. There is a risk that these standard contractual clauses may be invalidated by the Court of Justice for the European Union as a lawful data transfer mechanism on the grounds that they do not provide adequate protection of European data subjects personally identifiable information. There is also a risk that EU data protection authorities may investigate or bring enforcement actions with criminal and administrative sanctions. Such actions could also damage our business and harm our reputation. Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection The FCCs Truth in Billing rules require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our satellite-based BA services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on ATG services. CALEA The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, which include Gogo, are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered service providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures. We have implemented such policies and procedures and based upon our periodic self-assessments we believe that our network is compliant with CALEA. Foreign Government Approvals In connection with our satellite service, we have implemented a process for obtaining any required authority needed to provide our service over the airspace of foreign countries or verifying that no additional authorization is needed. Each country over which a Gogo-equipped aircraft flies has the right to limit, regulate ( e.g ., through a licensing regime) or prohibit the offering of our service. We may not be able to obtain the necessary authority for every country over which a partner airline flies. For some countries, we have not been and do not expect to be able to obtain a definitive answer regarding their potential regulation of our service, and we may incur some regulatory risk by operating over the airspace of these countries. Failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements could result in penalties being imposed on Gogo and/or on its airline partners, allow airline partners affected by such requirements to terminate their contracts with us prior to expiration or, under a contract with one of our airline partners, require us to pay liquidated damages. Regulation by U.S. and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. Moreover, even countries that have previously provided clearance for our service have the right to change their regulations at any time. Seasonality The demand for air travel, including business travel, is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect our overall passenger opportunity to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year due to an increase in leisure travel offset in part by a decrease in business travel during the summer months and holidays. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 16 Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us. We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States and certain countries outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we held U.S. patents expiring on dates ranging from February 2019 to December 2037, and foreign patents expiring on dates ranging from August 2020 to June 2035. We do not believe that our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective. We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the United States and certain other countries include, among others, Gogo, Gogo Biz and Gogo Vision, although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We license or purchase from third parties technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors. We also license our proprietary technology and software to third parties to enable them to integrate such technology and software into the products they provide to us. Many of our agreements with such third parties are renewable for indefinite periods of time unless either party chooses to terminate, although some of our agreements expire after fixed periods and require renegotiation prior to expiration in order to extend the term. Among the most material of our technology-related agreements are those for modems, base stations and antennas. Our agreements for modems, base stations and antennas do not renew automatically and thus require periodic renegotiation. Such agreements as well as certain licenses to commercially available software are material to our business. We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, vendors, and airline partners. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained. Employees As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,153 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Corporate Information Gogo Inc. is a holding company that does business through its subsidiaries. Our principal operating subsidiaries are Gogo LLC and Gogo Business Aviation LLC, which are direct, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC.

Risk Factors You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below. Risks Related to Our CA Business We are dependent on agreements with our airline partners to be able to access passengers and provide services to airlines for use by the crew and airline operations. Payments for our services on commercial airlines have provided, and will continue to provide, a significant portion of our revenue. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits from these agreements on a timely basis or to renew any existing agreements upon expiration or termination may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had our equipment installed and provided our Gogo service to passengers on aircraft operated by 14 airlines and we had definitive contracts with four additional airlines. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Gogo service we provide on commercial aircraft generated approximately 49%, 64% and 64% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Our ability to meet our commitments to certain of our customers requires us to reach agreements with OEMs to have our equipment installed on newly manufactured aircraft by the OEM, which will require us to comply with OEM specifications, which may be costly and time-consuming. Our growth is dependent on our ability to have our equipment installed on additional aircraft and increase passenger use of the Gogo service on installed aircraft. Any delays in installations under these contracts may negatively affect our relationships with airline partners and our ability to maintain or grow our passenger user base and revenue, as may unavailability or degradation of our service 18 resulting from the failure of our equipment or software or other factors. In addition, we have no assurance that any of our current airline partners will renew their existing contracts with us upon expiration, or that they will not terminate their contracts prior to expiration upon the occurrence of certain contractually stipulated events. Contractual termination events include our bankruptcy and our material breach of contract, which in certain contracts is defined to include material breach of our service level agreements, and/or failure to achieve certain certification, equipment delivery, installation or other milestones within agreed-upon time frames. Several contracts with airline partners permit such airline to terminate the contract if the percentage of passengers using connectivity on such airlines flights falls below certain negotiated thresholds. One contract with an airline partner from which we derived a significant portion, but less than a majority, of our 2018 consolidated revenue permits such airline partner to terminate its contract with us if the airlines revenue share falls below certain thresholds and Gogo elects to not make the airline whole for such revenue share shortfall. Contracts with airline partners from which in the aggregate we derived a majority of our 2018 consolidated revenue allow those airlines to terminate a portion or all of their respective agreements for convenience, in some instances with no fee required. Depending on the contract, the airline may exercise such termination right at any time following contract signing or after a specified period of time passes following signing. Additionally, our contracts with American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and certain other airline partners, from which in the aggregate we derived a majority of our 2018 consolidated revenue, permit such airline partners to terminate all or a portion of their contracts if another company provides a connectivity service that is a material improvement over our service, such that failing to adopt such alternative service would likely cause competitive harm to the airline, and we are unable to match the competitive offer in terms of price, technology and schedule. Under the Unified Agreement with American Airlines, the airline has the option to terminate our service, and, as expected, it exercised such option on approximately 550 mainline aircraft on which our ATG/ATG-4 service has been provided. Of such aircraft, 374 were deinstalled in 2018 (primarily in the second half of the year) with the balance expected to be deinstalled in the first half of 2019. To the extent that our airline partners terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us for any reason, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Certain of our contracts with our airline partners include provisions that, under certain circumstances, entitle our airline partners to the benefit of certain more favorable provisions in other airline partners connectivity agreements, including terms related to termination, maintenance, service and equipment and bandwidth pricing. These provisions, some of which have retroactive effect, may limit the benefits we realize from contracts containing such provisions. In addition, our inability to identify and offer improved terms to an airline partner in accordance with such a provision could negatively affect our relationship with that airline partner or give rise to a claim that we are in breach of such connectivity agreement. A failure to maintain airline and passenger satisfaction with our equipment or the Gogo service could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. Our relationships with our airline partners are critical to the growth and success of our business. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, use of the Gogo service on Delta Air Lines aircraft accounted for approximately 23%, 26% and 27%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, use of the Gogo service on American Airlines aircraft accounted for approximately 11%, 21% and 23%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. If our airline partners are not satisfied with our equipment or the Gogo service for any reason, they may reduce efforts to co-market the Gogo service to their passengers, which together with passenger dissatisfaction could result in lower passenger usage and reduced revenue. In addition, airline dissatisfaction with us for any reason, including delays in obtaining certification for or installation of our equipment, failure of our system to meet specifications, or our failure to comply with our service level obligations, could negatively affect our relationship with the airline partner and our reputation among passengers and other airlines and constitute a breach of contract resulting in penalties, claims for damages or termination rights. 19 We are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The success of our CA business depends on our ability to provide adequate bandwidth to meet customer demands. The capacity of our ATG network is limited by the spectrum licensed and we are currently experiencing capacity constraints in the United States, particularly on certain flights where demand for our service is high and certain routes on which multiple aircraft are within range of the same cell site at one time. We may also experience capacity constraints internationally. We expect demand to continue to increase in CA-NA and CA-ROW as passenger adoption increases (including as a result of airline partners offering free service to passengers), bandwidth requirements per user grow and our service becomes available on more aircraft. Our plan to alleviate such constraints consists of: (i) continued installation of 2Ku on aircraft flying routes in the United States, including aircraft on which our existing ATG systems will be upgraded; (ii) successful development and deployment of an upgrade to our existing ATG network; (iii) purchasing and employing capacity from a variety of satellites; and (iv) continued use of bandwidth management tools. The successful execution of this plan is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in this Risk Factors section under the headings  We may be unsuccessful or delayed in widely deploying and operating our 2Ku technology,  We may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying our next-generation ATG technology,  and  We face risks related to satellites and satellite capacity .  With respect to our use of bandwidth management tools, in June 2015, the FCC adopted broad net neutrality rules pursuant to an order released in March 2015 (the Open Internet Order). The Open Internet Order prohibited broadband providers from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind; or prioritizing the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contained an exception for reasonable network management. In January 2018, the FCC voted to partially repeal the February 2015 order effective in June 2018, and in doing so eliminated virtually all of the then-existing net neutrality obligations applicable to us. Members of Congress have proposed legislation to overturn the FCCs recent decision and the outcome of such proposal or other attempts to undo the decision cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, several states, including California, have proposed or enacted net neutrality legislation similar in substance to the Open Internet Order. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed suit to block the California legislation and California has agreed to delay implementation of the law pending the outcome of such litigation. If the federal neutrality rules were reinstated, they could constrain our ability to manage our network and make it more difficult for us to meet capacity demands, as could existing or future state net neutrality laws or additional federal net neutrality laws. There can be no assurance that the actions we are taking will be sufficient to provide enough capacity in the United States or internationally. In addition, our ability to meet capacity demands depends in part on the willingness of airline customers to agree to install or upgrade to 2Ku and, if and when we deploy a solution that upgrades the ATG network, to install or upgrade to that solution. If we fail to meet capacity demands, it could negatively affect our relationship with the airline partner and our reputation among passengers and other airlines and constitute a breach of contract resulting in penalties, claims for damages or termination rights, and our business prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 20 Our business is highly dependent on the airline industry, which is itself affected by factors beyond the airlines control. The airline industry is highly competitive and sensitive to changing economic conditions. Our business is directly affected by the number of passengers flying on commercial aircraft, the financial condition of the airlines and other economic factors. If consumer demand for air travel declines, including due to increased use of technology such as videoconferencing for business travelers, or the number of aircraft and flights shrinks due to, among other reasons, reductions in capacity by airlines, the number of passengers available to use the Gogo service will be reduced, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Unfavorable general economic conditions and other events that are beyond the airlines control, including higher unemployment rates, higher interest rates, reduced stock prices, reduced consumer and business spending, outbreaks of communicable diseases and terrorist attacks or threats could have a material adverse effect on the airline industry. A general reduction or shift in discretionary spending could result in decreased demand for leisure and business travel and lead to a reduction in airline flights offered and the number of passengers flying. Consolidation within the airline industry could also adversely affect our relationships with our existing airline partners or lead to Gogo-equipped aircraft being taken out of service. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could also limit airlines ability to counteract increased fuel, labor or other costs though raised prices. Our airline partners operate in a highly competitive business market and, as a result, continue to face pressure on offerings and pricing. These unfavorable conditions and the competitiveness of the air travel industry could cause one or more of our airline partners to reduce expenditures on passenger services including deployment of the Gogo service or to file for bankruptcy. If one or more of our airline partners were to file for bankruptcy, bankruptcy laws could give them rights to terminate their contracts with us, they could reduce their total fleet size and capacity and/or their total number of flights, and/or they could attempt to renegotiate the terms of their contracts with us including the pricing of our equipment and services. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We face risks related to satellites and satellite capacity. We rely on third-party suppliers for the satellite capacity required to provide our Ku and 2Ku services and currently have agreements with several satellite partners to provide Ku-band satellite service on a non-exclusive basis. Service is typically provided through individual service orders for specified transponders, which range in duration from one to ten years. If any of these agreements were terminated or not renewed upon expiration, or if any of our satellite partners fail to obtain, or lose, necessary regulatory authorizations, we could face material delays or interruptions in the provision of service to our customers that rely on satellite service for connectivity or other services and we may not be able to find alternative satellite partners on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Certain of our agreements with satellite service providers commit us to purchase bandwidth up to ten years in advance, which may be inadequate to meet capacity demands or may exceed passenger demand and require us to incur unnecessary costs. See  We are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The usefulness of the satellites upon which we currently rely and may rely on in the future is limited by each satellites minimum design life. For example, the satellites through which we provide Ku-band service have minimum design lives ranging from 10 to 15 years. Our ability to offer in-flight connectivity outside North America and alleviate capacity constraints throughout our network depends on the continued operation of the satellites or any replacement satellites, each of which has a limited useful life. We can provide no assurance, however, as to the actual operational lives of those or future satellites, which may be shorter than their design lives, nor can we provide assurance that replacement satellites will be developed, authorized or successfully deployed. 21 In the event of a failure or loss of any of these satellites, our satellite service providers may relocate another satellite and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such a relocation may require regulatory approval, including through, among other things, a showing that the replacement satellite would not cause additional interference compared to the failed or lost satellite. We cannot be certain that our satellite service providers could obtain such regulatory approval. In addition, we cannot guarantee that another satellite will be available for use as a replacement for a failed or lost satellite, or that such relocation can be accomplished without disrupting or otherwise adversely impacting our business. Certain satellites we currently plan to utilize to provide Ku-band satellite service have not yet been launched. Satellite construction and launch are subject to significant risks, including delays, launch failure and incorrect orbital placement. Launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites and to obtain other launch opportunities. Construction and launch delays, including any delay in the launch of satellites intended to replace one of the satellites we currently plan to utilize to provide Ku-band satellite service, may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. We may not be able to grow our business with current airline partners or successfully negotiate agreements with airlines to which we do not currently provide the Gogo service; the effect of shifts in business models on our revenue and results of operations cannot be predicted. We are currently in negotiations or discussions with certain of our airline partners to provide our equipment and the Gogo service on additional aircraft in their fleets. We have no assurance that these efforts will be successful. We are also in discussions with other airlines to provide our equipment and the Gogo service to some or all of their aircraft. Negotiations with current and prospective airline partners require substantial time, effort and resources. The time required to reach a final agreement with an airline is unpredictable and may lead to variances in our operating results from quarter to quarter. We may ultimately fail in our negotiations and any such failure could harm our results of operations due to, among other things, a diversion of our focus and resources, actual costs incurred in the negotiation process and opportunity costs. In addition, the terms of any future agreements could be materially different and less favorable to us than the terms included in our existing agreements with our airline partners, which could trigger most favored nations provisions of contracts with certain existing airline partners, which could result in our inability to achieve the originally anticipated benefits of such contracts. While under our turnkey model, we provide the connectivity service, determine passenger pricing and share revenue with the airline. Several of our airline partners have adopted or have the option to adopt the airline-directed model, under which the airlines purchase bandwidth from us and distribute it to their passengers on a paid or complimentary basis. Under the airline-directed model, the airline retains pricing discretion over the cost of our service to passengers and the extent to which we receive revenue under this model is directly related to passenger usage. As a result, a failure by airlines to price our service appropriately could adversely affect our results. We expect commercial models and contract terms to continue to evolve, and we anticipate that third-party payors (including airlines) will generate an increasing portion of our revenue and that the portion of our revenue paid by passengers using our service will decline. Certain airline partners have informed us that they intend to shift from the airline directed model to the turnkey model, and we are unable to predict to what extent future shifts in commercial models will occur or the effect that such shifts in models will have on our results of operations. In addition, our growth will depend in part on our ability to reach agreements with OEMs to have our equipment factory-installed on certain aircraft, which will require us to comply with OEM specifications, which may be costly and time-consuming. To the extent that any negotiations with current or potential airline partners are unsuccessful, or any existing or future agreements, including those reflecting evolving business models, prove generally less favorable to us than expected or as compared to previous agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 22 Competition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and harm our results of operations. We face intense competition from providers of satellite-based broadband connectivity and in-flight entertainment services. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations, have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources and may be better able to withstand the effects of pricing pressures or periodic economic downturns or may offer a broader product line to customers, including services we do not currently provide and/or may not provide in the future. With respect to our ATG services, while we are currently the only provider of ATG service in North America, a competitor is developing a North American air-to-ground 4G network that may become available as early as 2019 using unlicensed spectrum, and other competitors could enter this business using the same or other spectrum. Internationally, one of our competitors is building a hybrid satellite and air-to-ground network to provide broadband service over Europe that may become available in 2019. With respect to our satellite services, the increased availability, development and adoption of satellite-based services by commercial airlines around the world has and will continue to put additional pressure on our ability to maintain our market position, and we expect our market position to decline as our competitors install more aircraft with their satellite-based systems in the U.S. and internationally. Two of our competitors are satellite owners and operators and it is possible that other satellite providers will enter the market and sell bandwidth directly to airlines. Due to their different business model, such competitors may be able to provide equipment and services at prices more competitive than ours or offer services we do not provide. We believe that the principal points of competition in CA are technological capabilities, geographic coverage, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support and timeliness, and, increasingly, the availability of factory installation. Some of our competitors offer factory installation on aircraft types on which Gogo has not yet met OEM requirements. Airlines desire for supplier diversification is also a factor in selection of connectivity providers, and if existing airline partners determine to award Gogo-installed or new aircraft to competitors, our ability to maintain or gain market position could be adversely affected. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Increased competition for airline partners and aircraft or other market forces could force us to lower the prices we charge airlines for equipment and service or lose market share and could adversely affect our growth prospects and profitability. In addition, to the extent that competing in-flight connectivity or entertainment services offered by commercial airlines are available on more aircraft or offer improved quality or reliability as compared to the Gogo service, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Competition among airlines with respect to the pricing of passenger services, as well as passengers expectations regarding pricing, may limit our ability to increase the price of our services under the turnkey model. Competition could increase our sales and marketing expenses and related customer acquisition costs. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to effectively respond to established and new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We face limitations on our ability to grow our domestic operations which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Our addressable market and our ability to expand domestically are limited by factors that include limitations on the number of U.S. commercial airlines with which we could partner, the number of planes in which our equipment can be installed, the passenger capacity within each plane, the ability of our network infrastructure or bandwidth to accommodate increasing capacity demands and our ability to successfully implement our technology roadmap on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our growth may slow, or we may stop growing 23 altogether, to the extent that we have exhausted all potential airline partners and as we approach installation on full fleets and maximum penetration rates for passenger connectivity service on all flights. In such circumstances, to continue to grow our domestic revenue, we would have to rely on passenger and airline partner adoption of other currently available and new or developing services and additional offerings, including Gogo Vision, Gogo TV, and CAS. We may not be able to profitably expand our domestic operations and if we fail to do so, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our CA-ROW business has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance, and we may be unsuccessful in expanding our operations internationally. We began our CA-ROW business in the first quarter of 2014, and its limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate the CA-ROW business and predict its future performance. The growth of our CA-NA segment since inception is not necessarily indicative of the future growth of CA-ROW. Any assessments of our current business and predictions that we or you make about the future financial and operating performance of CA-ROW or its effect on our consolidated financial and operating performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history in that segment. Our ability to grow and achieve profitability in CA-ROW involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources in unfamiliar markets, limitations on such investment under the indenture governing our senior secured notes and economic and financial market conditions. Further, our expansion plans require significant management attention and resources, and our CA business has limited experience in selling our solutions in international markets as compared to North American markets, or in conforming to local cultures, standards or policies. Certain of our competitors, including current providers of satellite service, have more experience than we do in the international commercial airline connectivity and in-flight entertainment markets. As a result, such competitors may have pre-existing relationships with international airlines and more experience in obtaining regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions or may already offer their equipment as standard, line-fit options on aircraft types, which may negatively affect our ability to enter into agreements with international airline partners or to increase the number of aircraft on which our equipment is installed thereunder. As we expand our international business we expect to incur increased expenses related to establishing facilities and hiring employees in certain foreign locations and expanding international marketing and advertising efforts. We may not be able to compete successfully in these international markets, and we may be unable to enter into agreements on satisfactory terms to provide connectivity and entertainment services to international fleets of our existing North American airline partners and to new international airline partners. In addition, our ability to expand will be limited by the demand for in-flight broadband Internet access in international markets. Any failure to compete successfully in international markets could also negatively impact our reputation and domestic operations. Our current and future international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in foreign operations, including: legal and regulatory restrictions, including communications, privacy, censorship, aerospace and liability standards, intellectual property laws and enforcement practices, as well as United States and foreign export and import controls; changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs; restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries, including restrictions on foreign ownership of telecommunications providers and imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); inability to find content or service providers to partner with on commercially reasonable terms; compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the (U.K.) Bribery Act 2010 and other similar anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and related risks, which risks could be increased by our interaction with employees of certain foreign government- 24 owned airlines who are deemed government officials under the FCPA and certain other anti-corruption laws and regulations; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; currency fluctuations; and potential adverse tax consequences. As a result of these obstacles, we may find it difficult or prohibitively expensive to grow our business internationally or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to do so, which could harm our business, future operating results and financial condition. Our failure to successfully grow our business internationally or comply with laws and regulations to which we become subject as a result of doing business internationally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unsuccessful or delayed in continuing to deploy and operate our 2Ku technology. As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 1,000 2Ku systems installed and approximately 1,000 systems in our backlog. There can be no assurance that we can meet our installation goals on our current timeline, due to risks that include delays in airlines making aircraft available for installation; the failure of 2Ku-related equipment and software to perform as expected during testing or following installation, problems arising in the manufacturing process, our reliance on single-source and other suppliers to provide certain components and services, and delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. We have encountered delays and quality problems as we deploy 2Ku, which we are in the process of remediating, and may continue to do so given the aggressive installation schedule that we are undertaking and the demands that the schedule places on employees, suppliers and other resources. In addition, other providers of satellite-based connectivity services currently have services available for commercial deployment that are intended to compete directly with 2Ku, and airlines may choose to adopt such a service over 2Ku. Fifteen domestic and international airlines have selected 2Ku for installation on all or a portion of their fleets. The failure of the 2Ku system to meet contractually agreed-upon specifications or to perform as expected, or significant delays in our ability to install 2Ku systems, have triggered and in the future may trigger the payment of liquidated damages under certain such agreements, and could result in material breaches of such agreements which could in turn result in claims by airlines for damages or termination of such agreements. If 2Ku fails to perform as expected or we fail to meet the installation timelines and performance metrics for which we have contracted, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our failure to timely deliver 2Ku could have a material adverse effect on our ability to alleviate capacity constraints in our network. See  We are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to timely remediate 2Ku quality and performance issues related to deicing fluid or other moisture entering our antennas, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected . As we have deployed 2Ku, we have encountered delays and quality problems arising from the entry into our antennas of moisture or liquids that may be caused by deicing procedures or other operational tasks (such as cleaning) that our airline partners may undertake or by humidity or condensation. In particular, the ingress of deicing fluid resulted in significant antenna performance issues in the winter of 2017 to 2018. As of 25 December 31, 2018, we had installed deicing modifications on approximately 95% of our North American fleet and had not experienced any instances of deicing-related system degradation on aircraft on which such modifications were installed. We have not experienced all potential weather and deicing conditions and there can be no assurance that further deicing issues will not arise. If additional deicing incidents or system degradation resulting from other moisture issues occur, we could incur significant remediation costs and, if we fail to remediate such problems when and as required to meet airline contract requirements, we will be in breach of the affected contracts, which could result in liquidated damages, or termination rights and associated claims or damages on the part of airlines, in airlines deciding not to market our services, and in harm to our reputation with passengers and other airlines, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be unsuccessful or delayed in developing and deploying our next generation ATG technology. We are currently exploring a number of solutions intended to offer additional bandwidth and improved speeds for our connectivity service as compared to existing ATG technologies. There can be no assurance that we will launch a next generation ATG technology in sufficient time to meet capacity demands and to effectively compete in ATG markets, due to, among other things, risks associated with: (i) our failure to design and develop a technology that provides the features and performance we require; (ii) integrating the solution with our existing ATG network; (iii) the availability of required spectrum; (iv) the failure of spectrum to perform as expected; (v) the failure of equipment and software to perform as expected; (vi) problems arising in the manufacturing process; (vii) our ability to negotiate contracts with suppliers on acceptable commercial and other terms; (viii) reliance on single-source and other suppliers to provide certain components and services, and (ix) delays in obtaining or failures to obtain the required regulatory approvals for installation and operation of such equipment and the provision of service to passengers. If our next generation ATG solution fails to perform as expected or its commercial availability is significantly delayed as compared to the timelines we establish, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our failure to timely deliver our next generation ATG solution could have a material adverse effect on our ability to alleviate capacity constraints in our network. See also  We are experiencing network capacity constraints in the United States and expect capacity demands to increase, and we may in the future experience capacity constraints internationally. If we are unable to successfully implement planned or future technology enhancements to increase our network capacity, or our airline partners do not agree to such enhancements, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.  We may be unsuccessful in generating or increasing revenue from Gogo Vision, our in-flight platform, Gogo TV, CAS and other services that we may offer in the future. The future growth prospects for our CA business depend, in part, on airlines or passengers paying for Gogo Vision on-demand video services, Gogo TV, CAS and new products and services that we develop in response to airline and passenger needs. Our ability to generate revenue from such services depends on: our ability to offer our services on new airlines and more aircraft and increase passenger adoption; our ability to obtain content (including digital rights to such content) from third parties for Gogo TV, Gogo Vision and new entertainment services; our ability to customize and improve services in response to trends and customer interests; our ability to develop new services; our ability to monetize existing and new services; the extent to which and pace at which airlines and other companies in the aviation industry adopt and utilize operational applications; and our ability to partner with third parties to develop and implement operational applications that are compatible with our networks. 26 If we are unsuccessful in generating or increasing revenue from these services and our in-flight platform, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. A future act or threat of terrorism, cyber-attack or other event could result in reduced demand for our products and services or result in a prohibition on the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft. A future act of terrorism or cyber-attack on an aircraft, the threat of such acts or unrelated airline accidents could have an adverse effect on the airline industry. In such event, our industry may experience significantly reduced passenger demand. The U.S. federal government or foreign governments could respond to such events by prohibiting the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices on aircraft, which would eliminate demand for our products and services. In addition, any association or perceived association between our equipment or service and the threat of terrorism, cyber-attacks or accidents involving aircraft on which our systems operate would likely have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services. Such reduced demand for our products and services may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Air traffic congestion at airports, air traffic control inefficiencies, weather conditions, such as hurricanes or blizzards, increased security measures, new travel-related taxes, the outbreak of disease or any other similar event could harm the airline industry. Airlines are subject to cancellations or delays due to weather conditions or natural disasters, air traffic control problems, including work stoppages or reduced government funding (including as a result of a government shutdown), breaches in security, outbreaks of communicable diseases or other factors. Such cancellations or delays could reduce the number of passengers on commercial flights, reduce demand for our products and services and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our BA Business Equipment sales to OEMs and after-market dealers account for a substantial portion of our revenue and earnings in the BA segment, and the loss of an OEM or dealer customer could materially and adversely affect our business and profitability. Revenue from equipment sales on contracts with OEMs and after-market dealers accounted for approximately 32%, 28% and 30%, respectively, of the revenue generated by our BA segment for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Almost all of BAs contracts with OEM and dealer customers are terminable at will by either party. If a key OEM or dealer terminates its relationship with us for any reason or our contract expires and is not renewed, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Our OEM customers may be materially adversely impacted by economic downturns and market disruptions. In anticipation of changing economic conditions, our customers may be more conservative in their production, which may reduce our market opportunities. Further, unfavorable market conditions could cause one or more of our OEM customers to file for bankruptcy, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Competition could result in price reduction, reduced revenue and loss of market position and could harm our results of operations. Our BA equipment and service are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production, and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand pricing pressures and the effects of periodic economic downturns or may offer a broader product line to customers. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if our competitors: develop equipment or service that is superior to our equipment and service; 27 develop equipment or service that is priced more competitively than our equipment and service; develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing equipment and services; or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We believe that the principal points of competition in our BA segment are technological capabilities, price, customer service, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale and timeliness of delivery and installation. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in technology, manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing and customer service and support. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer. In addition, competition may subject us to downward pricing pressures. Pricing at too high a level could adversely affect our ability to gain new customers and retain current customers, while increased competition could force us to lower our prices or lose market position and could adversely affect growth prospects and profitability. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or support capabilities to continue to compete successfully. A failure to respond to established and new competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. A competitor is developing a North American air-to-ground 4G network that may become available as early as 2019 using unlicensed spectrum, and other competitors could enter this business using the same or other spectrum. We generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our equipment. Further, we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers, so we take the risk for cost overruns. Many of our OEM customers may terminate their contracts with us on short notice and, in many cases, our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our equipment. In addition, in certain cases, we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon non-binding production schedules provided by OEMs, the historical purchasing patterns of customers, and informal discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements. Cancellations, reductions or delays by customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, pursuant to many of our contracts with our OEM customers, we have agreed to deliver equipment and/or services, including equipment and services not yet in production, for a fixed price and, accordingly, take the risk of any cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product. Many of the risks that could harm our CA business could also adversely affect our BA business. In our BA segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, sales of ATG equipment accounted for more than 60% of equipment revenue, and subscriptions for our Gogo Biz in-flight broadband Internet service accounted for more than 85% of service revenue. Accordingly, many of the risks described above relating to our CA business may also have a material adverse effect on our BA business, including expected capacity constraints on our network in the near-term and our ability to manage those constraints, our ability to successfully develop and implement a next generation ATG solution, our ability to successfully implement technology enhancements to our network and our ability to successfully develop and deploy new products and services and generate revenue and profits from the sale of such products and services. Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property and Regulation Our CA-NA and BA businesses are dependent on the availability of spectrum. In June 2006, we purchased at FCC auction an exclusive ten-year, 3 MHz license for ATG spectrum, and in April 2013, as part of our acquisition of Airfone, we acquired an additional 1MHz ATG spectrum license. In 2017, our applications to renew our licenses were granted for additional ten-year terms without further payment. Any breach of the terms of our FCC licenses or FCC regulations including foreign ownership restrictions, 28 permitted uses of the spectrum and compliance with FAA regulations could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of our licenses or a refusal by the FCC to renew the licenses upon expiration. Further, in connection with an application to renew our licenses upon expiration, a competitor could file a petition opposing such renewal on anti-competitive or other grounds. On August 3, 2017, the FCC released an order which, among other things, revises the wireless license renewal rules. As a result of this order, which applies to the industry generally, all licensees will need to make a showing (or certification) at renewal to demonstrate that the licensee provided and continues to provide service to the public. Because the 1 MHz ATG license has no construction or substantial service requirement, it is currently not clear what level and length of service the FCC will find adequate when considering the next renewal of the 1 MHz ATG license in 2026. While we do not currently use this license, changes in technology may enable its use in our network in the future. An ambiguous renewal requirement could impair our flexibility to use or otherwise realize the value of such spectrum beyond 2026. Our ability to offer in-flight broadband Internet access through our ATG service currently depends on our ability to maintain rights to use the 3MHz ATG spectrum in the U.S. and our failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to meet increasing capacity demands and expand our service offerings in the United States will depend in part upon our ability to successfully roll-out our plans to employ unlicensed spectrum in the 2.4 GHz band for concurrent use with the licensed 3MHz spectrum. While we are the exclusive licensee of the only United States spectrum dedicated to ATG connectivity, additional ATG spectrum, whether licensed or unlicensed, is or may become available in the United States or internationally in the future. While we have exclusive rights to the only spectrum licensed by the FCC for ATG use and are currently the only provider of ATG service in the United States, the FCC may in the future decide to auction additional spectrum for ATG use that is not currently designated for that purpose, or a competitor could develop technology or a business plan that allows it to cost effectively use spectrum not specifically reserved for ATG, but on which ATG use is not prohibited, to provide broadband connectivity. The availability of additional spectrum in the marketplace that is available for ATG use may increase the possibility that we may face competition from one or more other ATG service providers in the future. For example, a competitor has announced that it is developing a North American 4G ATG network using unlicensed spectrum. While competition in CA-ROW currently consists of satellite-based connectivity services, discussions are occurring in the European Union and elsewhere regarding the use of spectrum for ATG service and one such competitor is building a European hybrid satellite and air-to-ground network to provide aviation customers connectivity service in Europe and has announced its intention to launch such service in 2019. As a result, we may face competition from such providers in such regions. If we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license. Under the Communications Act and applicable FCC regulations, we are effectively restricted from having more than 25% of our capital stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons, including individuals and entities organized outside the United States or controlled by non-U.S. persons. We have established procedures to ascertain the nature and extent of our foreign ownership, and we believe that the indirect ownership of our equity by foreign persons or entities is below the 25% cap. However, as a publicly traded company we may not be able to determine with certainty the exact amount of our stock that is held by foreign persons or entities at any given time. A failure to comply with applicable restrictions on ownership by non-U.S. persons could result in an order to divest the offending ownership, fines, denial of license renewal 29 and/or spectrum license revocation proceedings, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected if we suffer service interruptions or delays, technology failures, damage to our equipment or system disruptions or failures arising from, among other things, force majeure events, cyber-attacks or other malicious activities, or satellite failures. Our brand, reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers depend upon the reliable performance of our in-flight portal, network infrastructure, content delivery processes and payment systems. We have experienced interruptions in these systems in the past, including server failures that temporarily slowed down our portals performance and users access to the Internet, or made our portal inaccessible, and we may experience service interruptions, service delays or technology or systems failures in the future, which may be due to factors beyond our control. In the past, failures resulting in users not being able to access the service have often been remedied by bypassing the payment processing step for users and directly connecting such users to the Internet, leading to a loss of revenue for those sessions. If we experience frequent system or network failures, our reputation, brand and customer retention could be harmed, we may lose revenue to the extent that we have to bypass the payment processing step in order to maintain users connectivity to the Internet, and such failures could be material breaches of airline contracts resulting in termination rights, penalties or airline claims for damages. Our operations and services depend upon the extent to which our equipment and the equipment of our third-party network providers is protected against damage or interruption from fire, floods, earthquakes, tornados, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events. The capacity, reliability and security of our network infrastructure are important to the operation of our business, which may suffer in the event of system disruptions or failures, such as computer hackings, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities. Our networks and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to these attacks and unauthorized access. In addition, the satellites upon which we rely for current services and will rely for future services are and will be subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions, which have occurred and may occur in the future as a result of various factors, such as satellite design and manufacturing defects, improper maintenance, problems with the power or control systems of the satellites and general failures resulting from certain weather conditions or other network impacting issues that may arise when satellites operate in the harsh environment of space. Certain satellites on which we rely or will rely have limited or no operating history. Our satellite network currently includes high throughput satellites, which were first launched in 2017, and will include low earth orbit satellites, the first of which is expected to launch in 2020. Damage to our or third parties networks could cause interruptions in the services that we provide. Such interruptions in our services could have a material adverse effect on service revenue, our reputation and our ability to attract or retain customers. Assertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including the wireless communications industry. We have faced, are currently facing and may in the future face claims that we or a supplier or customer have violated patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Many companies, including our competitors, are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could potentially cover many aspects of our business. In addition, there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet. We have not exhaustively searched patents relevant to our technologies and business and therefore it is possible that we may be unknowingly infringing the patents of others. 30 Any infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious and whether or not they result in litigation, are time-consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease providing certain products or services, adjust our merchandizing or marketing and advertising activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. Pursuant to our contracts with our airline partners and certain BA customers, we have agreed to indemnify our airline partners and such customers against such claims, and our indemnification obligations generally include defending or paying for the defense of the action and paying any judgments or other costs assessed against the aviation partner in the event of an adverse outcome. In most cases, our contracts do not cap our indemnification obligations. In addition, certain of our suppliers do not indemnify us for third party infringement or misappropriation claims arising from our use of supplier technology, and we may be liable in the event of such claims. Our inability to meet our indemnification obligations and our airline partners terminating or failing to renew their contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We or our technology suppliers may be unable to continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to consumers, airlines and other aircraft operators. The market for our services is characterized by evolving technology, changes in aviation partner and passenger needs and frequent new service and product introductions. Our success will depend, in part, on our and our suppliers ability to continue to enhance existing technology and services or develop new technology and services for both passenger and aircraft operational use on a timely and cost-effective basis. If we or our suppliers fail to adapt quickly enough to changing technology, aviation partner and passenger requirements and/or regulatory requirements, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We expect to have to invest significant capital to keep pace with innovation and changing technology, and if the amount of such investment exceeds our plans or the amount of investment permitted under the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, the proliferation of new mobile devices and new operating platforms poses challenges for our research and development efforts. If we are unable to create, or obtain rights to, cost effective solutions for a particular device or operating platform, we will be unable to effectively attract users of these devices or operating platforms and our business may be materially adversely affected. As is common in industries like ours, changing technology may result in obsolescence as we implement new technologies and products and retire old technologies and products. As we encounter such obsolescence, we need to ensure that we have a sufficient supply of parts, products and equipment compatible with our existing technology, as well as access to maintenance, repair and other critical support services, until the transition is completed. Certain suppliers may determine to stop manufacturing and supplying end-of-life parts, products and equipment, or may stop providing related services, prior to completion of our transition. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient inventory from existing suppliers we would be required to engage new suppliers who have access to the intellectual property required to manufacture and support components that meet our specifications, and we may not be able to contract with such suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We have implemented policies and procedures intended to ensure that we timely anticipate technology and product transitions and have access to sufficient inventory and services, but if such policies prove ineffective and we are unable to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business to effect a transition, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, following our retirement of end-of-life technologies and products, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand and might have to write off unusable inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 31 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, domain names and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, vendors, airline partners, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought and obtained patent protection for certain of our technologies in the United States and certain other countries. Many of the trademarks that we use (including marks we have applied to register) contain words or terms having a somewhat common usage, such as Gogo and Gogo Vision and, as a result, we may have difficulty registering them in certain jurisdictions. We do not own, for example, the domain www.gogo.com and we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we do business or may do business in the future, including China and India. If other companies have registered or have been using in commerce similar trademarks for services similar to ours in foreign jurisdictions, we may have difficulty in registering, or enforcing an exclusive right to use, our marks in those foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be effective, that any patent and trademark applications will lead to issued patents and registered trademarks in all instances, that others will not obtain intellectual property rights to similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or infringed by others. Furthermore, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices of other countries in which our service is or may in the future be offered may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use, our ability to exploit our proprietary technology or our brand image may be harmed, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our use of open source software could limit our ability to commercialize our technology. Open source software is software made widely and freely available to the public in human-readable source code form, usually with liberal rights to modify and improve such software. Some open source licenses require as a condition of use that proprietary software that is combined with licensed open source software and distributed must be released to the public in source code form and under the terms of the open source license. Accordingly, depending on the manner in which such licenses were interpreted and applied, we could face restrictions on our ability to commercialize certain of our products and we could be required to: (i) release the source code of certain of our proprietary software to the public, including competitors, if the open source software was linked to in a manner that would require such release of our proprietary software source code; (ii) seek licenses from third parties for replacement software; and/or (iii) re-engineer our software in order to continue offering our products. Such consequences may materially adversely affect our business. The failure of our equipment or material defects or errors in our software may damage our reputation, result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages, and impair our ability to sell our service. Our products contain complex systems, components and software that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology or when new software is first introduced or new versions or enhancements are released. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. In addition, such events could result in significant expenses and diversion of development and other resources, a reduction in sales or delay in market acceptance of our products and services, loss of existing customers, terminations of, failures to renew, penalties or damage claims under aviation partner contracts, harm to our reputation and brand image and increased insurance costs. If our in-flight system has a malfunction resulting from an error or defect or a problem with installation or maintenance and such malfunction causes physical damage to an aircraft or impairs its on-board electronics or avionics, significant property loss and serious personal injury or death could result. Any such failure could 32 expose us to substantial personal injury claims, product liability claims or costly repair obligations. The aircraft operated by our aviation partners may be very costly to repair and the damages in any product liability claims could be material. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover claims. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we indemnify most of our airline partners for losses due to third-party claims and in certain cases the causes of such losses may include failure of our products. Should we be required by the FAA or otherwise to cease providing the Gogo service, even on a temporary basis, as a result of a product malfunction or defect, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be materially adversely affected. Regulation by United States and foreign government agencies, including the FCC, which issued our exclusive ATG spectrum license, and the FAA, which regulates the civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries in the United States, may increase our costs of providing service or require us to change our services. We are subject to various regulations, including those regulations promulgated by various federal, state and local regulatory agencies and legislative bodies and comparable agencies outside the United States where we may do business. The two U.S. government agencies that have primary regulatory authority over our operations are the FCC and the FAA. The FCC regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us and the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale and interconnection of wireless telecommunications systems. Any breach of the terms of our ATG spectrum licenses or other licenses and authorizations obtained by us from time to time, or any violation of the Communications Act or the FCCs rules, could result in the revocation, suspension, cancellation or reduction in the term of a license or the imposition of fines. From time to time, the FCC may monitor or audit compliance with the Communications Act and the FCCs rules or with our licenses, including if a third party were to bring a claim of breach or noncompliance. In addition, the Communications Act, from which the FCC obtains its authority, may be amended in the future in a manner that could be adverse to us. The commercial and private aviation industries, including civil aviation manufacturing and repair industries, are highly regulated in the United States by the FAA. FAA certification is required for all equipment we install on commercial aircraft and type certificated business aircraft, and certain of our operating activities require that we obtain FAA certification as a parts manufacturer. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled BusinessLicenses and RegulationFederal Aviation Administration, FAA approvals required to operate our business include STCs and Parts Manufacturing Authority (PMA). Obtaining STCs and PMAs is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. Prior to installation of our equipment, any inability to obtain, delay in obtaining (including as a result of a government shutdown or funding shortages), or change in, needed FAA certifications, authorizations, or approvals, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our installation commitments, manufacture and sell parts for installation on aircraft, or expand our business. Following installation of our equipment, if we were to discover that our equipment or components of our equipment were not in compliance with specifications on which the STC authorizing installation was based, or if the FAAs requirements changed, our non-compliance could result in our incurring material costs to inspect and in some circumstances modify or replace such equipment, and could in rare circumstances result in our system being turned off or installed aircraft being grounded. Our failure to comply with FAA regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The FAA closely regulates many of our operations. If we fail to comply with the FAAs many regulations and standards that apply to our activities, we could lose the FAA certifications, authorizations, or other approvals on which our manufacturing, installation, maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alteration capabilities are based. In addition, from time to time, the FAA or comparable foreign agencies adopt new regulations or amend existing regulations. The FAA could also change its policies regarding the delegation of inspection and certification responsibilities to private companies, which could adversely affect our business. To the extent that any such new regulations or amendments to existing regulations or policies apply to our activities, our compliance costs would likely increase. 33 We are required to contribute a percentage of all revenue generated from interstate or international telecommunications services or interconnected VoIP services, which we offer in the BA segment to the federal Universal Service Fund, which subsidizes telecommunications services in areas that are expensive to serve. Broadband Internet access services are currently exempt from these USF contribution requirements. As a broadband Internet provider, we must comply with CALEA, which requires communications carriers to ensure that their equipment, facilities and services can accommodate certain technical capabilities in executing authorized wiretapping and other electronic surveillance. Currently, our CALEA solution is fully deployed in our network. However, we could be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC or law enforcement agencies for any delays in complying or failure to comply with, CALEA, or similar obligations. Such enforcement actions could subject us to fines, cease and desist orders, or other penalties, all of which may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. Further, to the extent the FCC adopts additional capability requirements applicable to broadband Internet providers, its decision may increase the costs we incur to comply with such regulations. We are also subject to regulation by foreign laws and regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which our international airline partners are registered, as well as foreign government agencies that choose to assert jurisdiction over us as a result of the service we provide on aircraft that fly international routes, including Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (formerly Industry Canada), which issued our exclusive Canadian ATG subordinate spectrum license and regulates our use of the spectrum licensed to us. Many of such jurisdictions impose assistance to law enforcement obligations similar to CALEA. Adverse decisions or regulations of these U.S. and foreign regulatory bodies may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could delay the deployment of our services and have other adverse consequences for us. Our ability to obtain certain regulatory approvals to offer the Gogo service internationally may also be the responsibility of our aviation partners or third parties, and therefore may be out of our control. We are unable to predict the impact of regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted by the various governmental entities that oversee portions of our business. If government regulation of the Internet changes, including with respect to e-commerce or online video distribution, we may need to change the way we conduct our business to a manner that incurs greater operating expenses, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The current legal environment for Internet communications, products and services is uncertain and subject to statutory, regulatory or interpretive change. We cannot be certain that we, our vendors and media partners or our aviation customers are currently in compliance with applicable regulatory or other legal requirements in the countries in which our service is used. Regulators may disagree with our interpretations of laws or regulations or the applicability of laws or regulations to our business, and existing laws, regulations and interpretations may change in unexpected ways. Our failure, or the failure of our vendors and media partners, customers and others with whom we transact business to comply with existing or future legal or regulatory requirements may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry If our efforts to retain and attract passenger users are not successful, our revenue will be adversely affected. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Gogo service we provide on commercial aircraft generated approximately 49%, 64% and 64% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. We must continue to retain existing users and attract new users. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Unreliable service levels, lack of sufficient capacity, the scope and nature of our service offerings, uncompetitive pricing, difficulty or delay in accessing our portal, lack of availability and cybersecurity and 34 privacy risks are some of the factors that may adversely impact our ability to retain existing users and attract new and repeat users. If passengers are able to satisfy their in-flight entertainment needs through activities other than broadband Internet access, at no or lower cost, they may not perceive value in our products and services. If our efforts to satisfy and retain our existing users are not successful, we may not be able to continue to attract new users through word-of-mouth referrals. Any of these factors could slow the growth of our service revenue, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our contract with one airline partner from which we derived a significant portion but less than a majority of our 2018 consolidated revenue allows for termination rights if the percentage of passengers using connectivity aboard the airlines Gogo-equipped flights falls below certain thresholds. The demand for in-flight broadband Internet access service may decrease or develop more slowly than we expect. We cannot predict with certainty the development of the U.S. or international in-flight broadband internet access market or the market acceptance for our products and services. Our future success depends upon growing demand for in-flight broadband Internet access services, which is inherently uncertain. We have invested significant resources in the deployment of new systems and service offerings, which represent a substantial part of our growth strategy. We face the risk that the U.S. and international demand for in-flight broadband Internet access services may decrease or develop more slowly or differently than we currently expect, or that our services, including our new offerings, may not achieve widespread market acceptance. We may be unable to market and sell our services successfully and cost-effectively to a sufficiently large number aviation partners. Our business depends on the continued proliferation of Wi-Fi as a standard feature in mobile devices. The growth in demand for in-flight broadband Internet access services also depends in part on the continued and increased use of laptops, smartphones, tablet computers, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices and the rate of evolution of data-intensive applications on the mobile Internet. If Wi-Fi ceases to be a standard feature in mobile devices, if the rate of integration of Wi-Fi on mobile devices decreases or is slower than expected, or if the use of Wi-Fi enabled devices or development of related applications decreases or grows more slowly than anticipated, the market for our services may be substantially diminished. We have incurred operating losses in every quarter since we launched the Gogo service and may continue to incur quarterly operating losses, which could negatively affect our stock price. We have incurred operating losses in every quarter since we launched our CA service in August 2008, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue in the future to generate operating income. Since our initial public offering (IPO), we have obtained debt financing through our entry into our previous credit facility, issuance of Convertible Notes and issuance of Senior Secured Notes (each as defined below). Excluding the impact of such financing activities, we have not generated positive cash flows on a consolidated basis, and our ability to do so will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenue and manage costs in each of our three business segments. In addition, our costs may increase in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on the continued roll-out of our technology roadmap and international expansion. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to numerous variables and such initiatives may require funding beyond the funding we currently expect and/or the funding we can secure. See the disclosure elsewhere in this Risk Factors section under the heading  We may need additional financing to execute our business plan or new initiatives, which we may not be able to secure on acceptable terms, or at all. Such variables include, for our technology roadmap, the availability of and costs associated with development and deployment of our next generation ATG solution, the timely and successful installation of our equipment, and the timing of the deployment of other technologies in the future, as well as costs incurred to develop and implement changes to ground and airborne software and hardware, costs associated with subsidizing our airline partners equipment purchases, including upgrades to ATG-4, 2Ku or other contractually obligated upgrades to our connectivity services and, with respect to satellite technologies, the cost of obtaining satellite capacity. With respect to our 35 international expansion, additional variables may include costs incurred to modify our portal for international deployment, costs related to sales and marketing activities and administrative support functions, additional legal and regulatory expenses associated with operating in the international commercial aviation market, costs incurred to set up branch offices, subsidiaries or other entities required to do business in certain countries, costs incurred to set up physical foreign offices and employment related costs for individuals located in those countries. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and promote our brand internationally. These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue and overall business, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may need additional financing, which we may not be able to secure on acceptable terms, or at all, to execute our business plan or new initiatives and refinance or repay our indebtedness at maturity. As of December 31, 2018, our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $223.5 million. However, we may require additional financing at some point in the future to fully execute our business plan, including our technology roadmap, international or domestic expansion plans or other changes. Our success may depend on our ability to raise such additional financing on reasonable terms and on a timely basis. The amount and timing of our capital needs will depend in part on the resources required to develop our next generation ATG solution, the extent of deployment of 2Ku and our next generation ATG service, the rate of customer penetration, the adoption of our service by airline partners and other factors set forth above that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may actively consider from time to time other significant technological, strategic and operational initiatives. In order to execute on any of these initiatives, we may require additional financing. Furthermore, we expect that we will require additional financing to refinance, or repay at maturity, our indebtedness, including $162.0 million of 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined below) that mature on March 1, 2020. Conditions in the economy and the financial markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary additional capital or financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is also limited by the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, as amended. As of December 31, 2018, Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries would have been able to incur approximately $9 million of additional indebtedness. See  Risks Related to our IndebtednessWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all . If we cannot secure sufficient additional financing, we may be forced to forego strategic opportunities or delay, scale back or eliminate additional service deployment, operations and investments or employ unplanned internal cost savings measures. Increased costs and other demands associated with our growth could impact our ability to achieve profitability and could strain our personnel, technology and infrastructure resources. Our costs could increase in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results. We continue to experience growth in our operations, which has placed significant demands on our management, administrative, technological, operational and financial infrastructure. Such growth, as well as anticipated future growth, including growth related to the broadening of our service offerings, the wide deployment of 2Ku, the development and implementation of our next generation ATG solution and other components of the technology roadmap, and continued investment in CA-ROW, have required and will require the outlay of significant operating and capital expenditures and will continue to place strains on our personnel, technology and infrastructure. The pace of our 2Ku installation schedule has placed significant strain on our organization and we have encountered supply chain issues that include delays in delivering and installing our equipment and failure of such equipment to meet specifications upon delivery. These issues have been exacerbated due to issues encountered in our recent implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to contain these costs and other costs associated with growth opportunities. To successfully manage the expected growth of our operations on a timely and cost- 36 effective basis we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, technological and management processes and controls and our reporting systems and procedures. In addition, as we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate new employees and develop and motivate all employees, and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. U.S. federal tax reform could materially adversely affect the Companys business and financial condition. On December 22, 2017, Congress enacted H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform). U.S. Tax Reform includes a number of provisions, including the lowering of the U. S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. There are also provisions that may partially offset the benefit of such rate reduction, such as a limitation on the deductibility of U.S. interest expense. U.S. Tax Reform also includes international provisions, which generally establish a territorial-style system for taxing foreign source income of domestic multinational corporations. The Companys financial statement impacts include adjustments for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The intended and unintended consequences of U.S. Tax Reform on our business are uncertain and could be adverse. We will continue to assess the effect of U.S. Tax Reform on our business as it relates to the disallowance of interest expense deductions, taxes on low taxed intangible foreign income as well as deductions for foreign derived intangible income and deductions for executive compensation. Adverse economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business. Macro-economic challenges are capable of creating volatile and unpredictable environments for doing business. We cannot predict the nature, extent, timing or likelihood of any economic slowdown or the strength or sustainability of any economic recovery, worldwide, in the United States or in the airline industry. For many travelers, air travel and spending on in-flight Internet access are discretionary purchases that they can eliminate in difficult economic times. Additionally, a weaker business environment could lead to a decrease in overall business travel, which has historically been an important contributor to our service revenue, or cause BA owners and operators of business aircraft to cut costs by reducing their purchases or use of private aircraft. Should an economic slowdown occur in the U.S. or globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our operating results may fluctuate unpredictably and may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors, adversely affecting our stock price. We operate in a dynamic industry and our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. Our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to many factors, many of which are not within our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Further, it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenue, margin and operating results, and if we fail to match our expected results or the results expected by financial analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected. In addition, due to generally lower demand for business travel during the summer months and holiday periods, and leisure and other travel at other times during the year, our quarterly results may not be indicative of results for the full year. Due to these and other factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as accurate indicators of our future performance. There can be no assurance that the implementation of our new business plan will be successful. On July 12, 2018, we announced the IBP, which is intended to significantly reduce our cost structure, improve quality, drive revenue, streamline business processes, improve the terms of our airline contracts by reducing equipment subsidies and strengthen our balance sheet. In connection with the development of the IBP, 37 our Board asked management to assess whether shareholder value would be increased by engaging in any of the strategic and/or financial relationships and transactions that have been suggested to us by third parties. There can be no assurance that changes under the IBP will result in improvements to our operational or financial performance, that negotiations with airline partners will be successful or that we will pursue any strategic or financial relationship or transaction, and the outcome of any change is uncertain. Further, the process of implementing initiatives under the IBP will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks caused by our implementation of the IBP, it may disrupt our business or adversely impact our revenue, operating results and financial condition. Our possession and use of personal information and the use of credit cards by users of our services present risks and expenses that could harm our business. Unauthorized disclosure or manipulation of such data, whether through breach of our network security or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation. In the ordinary course of our business, we or our third-party providers collect, process and store sensitive data, including personal information of aircraft passengers and our employees and credit card information. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information (and other sensitive data such as our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers) is critical to our operations and business strategy. We depend on the security of our networks and, in part, on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party providers of telecommunications, cloud computing, customer support and payment processing services, and other vendors. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, hardware or software defects or other disruptions. Further, our in-cabin network operates as an open, unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot, and non-encrypted transmissions users send over this network may be vulnerable to access by other users on the same plane. Unauthorized use of our, or our third-party service providers, networks, computer systems and services could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information, including personal information and credit card information of passengers using our service. Data security threats are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. There can be no assurance that any security measures we, or third parties, take will be effective in preventing these activities, given the constantly changing nature of the threats. Any such security incidents, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under our contracts with airline partners, which generally require us to indemnify the airline for passenger and other third-party claims arising from data security breaches. In addition, such incidents may disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to protect confidential user data or to provide users with adequate notice of our privacy policies could also subject us to investigations and regulatory penalties imposed by United States federal and state regulatory agencies, non-U.S. regulatory agencies or courts. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) could assert jurisdiction to impose penalties if it found our privacy policies or security measures to be inadequate under existing federal law. We could also be subject to certain state laws that impose data breach notification requirements, specific data security obligations, or other consumer privacy-related requirements. Our failure to comply with any of these rules or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also must comply with certain Communications Act and FCC privacy and data security rules for our voice services, including certain provisions applicable to customer proprietary network information. Our failure to comply with these requirements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 38 Other countries in which we may operate or from which our services may be offered, including those in the European Union, also have certain privacy and data security requirements that may apply to our business, either now or in the future. These countries laws may in some cases be more stringent than the requirements in the United States. For example, European Union member countries have specific requirements relating to cross-border transfers of personal information to certain jurisdictions, including to the United States. In addition, some countries have stricter consumer notice and/or consent requirements relating to personal information collection, use or sharing. Moreover, international privacy and data security regulations have become more complex. In May 2018, the GDPR took effect, which has imposed even more restrictive privacy-related requirements. Despite the substantial preparation and related expenditures that we undertook to be in compliance with the GDPR as of its effective date, there can be no assurance that we are or will continue to be in compliance. Certain states have also enacted specific privacy laws to which we may be subject. For example, in September 2018, the governor of California signed into law an amended version of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The CCPA provides broad new privacy rights for California consumers, including, among others, the right to obtain copies of their personal information collected in the past 12 months, the ability to opt-out from the sale of personal information, and the right to demand deletion of personal information. The CCPA will also impose compliance requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from consumers, including notice, consent, and data retention requirements. It will take effect on January 1, 2020. Our failure to comply with GDPR or other privacy or data security-related laws, rules or regulations imposed by U.S. federal or state governments or agencies or foreign governments or agencies could result in material penalties imposed by regulators or cause us to be in material breach under our airline agreements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, substantially all connectivity customers use credit cards to purchase our products and services. Problems with our or our vendors billing software could adversely affect our customer satisfaction and could cause one or more of the major credit card companies to disallow our continued use of their payment services. If our billing software fails to work properly and, as a result, we do not automatically charge our subscribers credit cards on a timely basis or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by major credit card companies, to comply with their data security standards to protect payment card information. New and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs. We depend upon third parties, many of which are single-source providers, to manufacture equipment components, provide services for our network and install and maintain our equipment. We rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components and services that we use to provide our ATG and satellite services. Many suppliers of critical components of our equipment are single-source providers. Components for which we rely on single-source suppliers include, among others, the antennas and modems for all systems, the radomes for our satellite systems and the equipment used at our ATG cell site base stations. If we are required for any reason (including expiration of the contract, termination by one party for material breach or other termination events) to find one or more alternative suppliers, we estimate that the replacement process could take up to two years depending upon the component, and we may not be able to contract with such alternative suppliers on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Finding and contracting with suppliers of some components may be delayed or made more difficult by current suppliers ownership of key intellectual property that requires alternative suppliers to either obtain rights to such intellectual property or develop new designs that do not infringe on such intellectual property. In addition, many of our components, such as the equipment used in our base stations, are highly integrated with other system components, which may further lengthen the time required for an alternative supplier to deliver a component that meets our system requirements. We also rely on a third party to provide the links between our data centers and our ground network. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or 39 if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In our CA business, installation and maintenance of our airborne ATG and satellite equipment is performed by employees of third-party service providers with whom we contract, and in some cases, by our airline partners, third-party service providers with whom the airline partners contract, or OEMs. In our BA segment, installation of our equipment is performed by the OEMs or dealers who purchase our equipment. Having third parties or our customers install or maintain our equipment reduces our control over the processes, including timeliness and quality. If there is an equipment failure, including due to problems with the installation or maintenance processes, our reputation and our relationships with our customers could be harmed. The passenger jets operated by our airline partners are very costly to repair and therefore damages for claims related to faulty installation or maintenance could be material. Additionally, we may be forced to pay significant remediation costs and/or penalties to airlines to cover equipment failure due to installation or maintenance problems and we may not be able to be indemnified for these costs. The supply of third party components and services could be interrupted or halted by a termination of our relationships, a failure of quality control or other operational problems at such suppliers or a significant decline in their financial condition. If we are not able to continue to engage suppliers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, or if such suppliers fail to deliver quality products, parts, equipment and services on a timely basis consistent with our schedule, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our agreements with our equipment and service providers may contain terms, such as those related to termination, pricing and service levels and related penalties, that are not consistent with our obligations under our agreements with customers that rely on such equipment for connectivity. Should we breach such customers agreements, we may be unable to seek indemnification for such losses from our providers. Further, if our suppliers were to increase their prices and we could not pass these increased costs on to our customers, it would increase our cost of service, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We depend upon ZTE to manufacture, install and maintain equipment and provide services for our existing ATG network, and ZTE has developed and agreed to supply equipment for the 2.4 GHz upgrade to the ATG network. ZTE USA, Inc. (ZTE USA) has historically developed, supplied and supported the base stations and associated core network elements used in our current ATG network. In addition, ZTE USA is developing and has agreed to supply the base stations, associated core network elements and modems for the 2.4GHz upgrade to our existing system. In April 2018, the U.S. Commerce Departments Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) found that China-based affiliates of ZTE USA (together with ZTE USA, ZTE) had violated a settlement agreement related to sanctions against Iran and North Korea. As a result of that finding, BIS issued a denial order prohibiting ZTE for seven years from participating in any transaction involving certain technology exported from the United States. The prohibited transactions precluded us from obtaining development services, support services, equipment and software from ZTE. In July 2018, BIS lifted the denial order. Media sources have recently reported that President Trump may sign an Executive Order that could preclude Chinese telecommunications providers from providing equipment for use in U.S. networks. We are unable to predict whether or when the Executive Order will be signed, whether it would apply to ZTE, and whether it would relate solely to future networks or also require operators of existing networks to replace equipment provided by Chinese telecommunications providers. In addition, in January 2018, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced bills that would ban the sale of U.S. chips and other components to ZTE and another Chinese telecommunications provider. If these or other government actions (including penalties that could be imposed if ZTE again violates the settlement agreement) limit or prohibit ZTEs performance of its obligations under our existing contracts, we 40 may be required to contract with a new supplier or suppliers for the equipment and/or services previously provided by ZTE for our existing ATG network and, should we decide to proceed with the 2.4 GHZ technology, for the development, supply, support and other services to complete the development and launch of that system. If we are unable to timely identify one or more alternate suppliers adequate to meet our needs and to negotiate commercially reasonable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we have incurred material operating and capital expenditures for ZTEs development work for the 2.4 GHz upgrade. If ZTE is unable to complete the development of that system and we are not able to repurpose such development work with a new supplier or recover all or a significant portion of such expenditures from ZTE, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We may fail to recruit, train and retain the highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive and execute our growth strategy. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business. Competition for key technical personnel in high-technology industries such as ours is intense. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, train, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to maintain and grow our ATG and satellite networks and related technology and develop and successfully deploy our technology roadmap and new wireless telecommunications products and technology. We may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting, training, retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel. In particular, we have had and may continue to have more difficulty attracting or retaining highly skilled personnel during periods of poor operating performance. Any failure to recruit, train and retain highly skilled employees may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel, including Oakleigh Thorne, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Such individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Gogo and its operations. As a result, if any of our key personnel were to leave Gogo, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss of productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and expertise. We do not maintain key man insurance on any of our officers or key employees. In addition, much of our key technology and systems is custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, could disrupt our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Businesses or technologies we acquire could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our ongoing business, dilute stockholder value or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. As part of our business strategy, we may engage in acquisitions of businesses or technologies to augment our organic or internal growth. We do not have any meaningful experience with integrating and managing acquired businesses or assets. Acquisitions involve challenges and risks in negotiation, execution, valuation and integration. Moreover, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities on terms that are acceptable to us. Even if successfully negotiated, closed and integrated, certain acquisitions may not advance our business strategy, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets or may fail. Any future acquisition could involve numerous risks, including: potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; difficulty integrating the operations and products of the acquired business; use of cash to fund the acquisition or for unanticipated expenses; limited market experience in new businesses; exposure to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies we acquire; additional costs due to differences in culture, geographical locations and duplication of key talent; 41 delays associated with or resources being devoted to regulatory review and approval; acquisition-related accounting charges affecting our balance sheet and operations; difficulty integrating the financial results of the acquired business in our consolidated financial statements; controls in the acquired business; potential impairment of goodwill; dilution to our current stockholders from the issuance of equity securities; and potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company. In the event we enter into any acquisition agreements, closing of the transactions could be delayed or prevented by regulatory approval requirements, including antitrust review, or other conditions. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any attempted acquisitions, and we could assume the economic risks of such failed or unsuccessful acquisitions. Difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could have a material effect on our results of operations. The provision of equipment to our airline partners results in significant accounts receivable. In 2018, a significant majority of the service revenue in CA was generated from passenger credit card transactions resulting in credit card accounts receivable, which are typically settled within one to three business days following the charge. Going forward, we expect an increasing portion of our CA services revenue to be billed directly to airline partners operating under the airline-directed model and to third-party distributors of our service. Service and equipment revenues in our BA segment are directly billed to customers. We may not be able to collect our receivables on a timely basis. Difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, as well as longer payment cycles, could lead to material fluctuations in our cash flows, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Expenses or liabilities resulting from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We and several of our airline partners are currently defendants in two patent infringement lawsuits. In addition, we and certain of our current and former executives are defendants in a securities class action lawsuit, and we are a nominal defendant, and members of our board of directors and certain current and former executives are defendants, in a related stockholder derivative lawsuit. We are required to indemnify our airline partner co-defendants in the infringement lawsuits and the directors and current and former officers who are defendants in the class action and derivative lawsuits for their defense costs and any judgments resulting from such suits. In the future, we may be subject to additional securities class action or derivative litigation. From time to time, we may also be subject to other claims or litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including for example, claims related to employment matters. Our operations are characterized by the use of new technologies and services across multiple jurisdictions that implicate various statutes and a range of rules and regulations that may be subject to broad or creative interpretation. This may result in litigation, including class action lawsuits, the outcome of which may be difficult to assess or quantify due to the potential ambiguity inherent in these regulatory schemes and/or the nascence of our technologies and services. Plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products and services, or require us to pay significant monetary damages, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce our existing contracts and, even if successful, may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation by or against any airline partner, customer or supplier could have the effect of negatively impacting our reputation and goodwill with existing and potential airline partners, customers and suppliers. 42 Our implementation of a new lease accounting standard in 2019 (ASC 842) will require substantial preparation, and our failure to properly implement this standard in a timely manner could result in inaccurate reporting of lease-related expenses and our right-of-use asset and lease obligation and cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new lease accounting guidance under ASC 842, which is effective for our interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after December 31, 2018. The new guidance introduces a lessee model that results in the recording of most leases on the balance sheet. Prior to adoption of the new standard, many of our leases were classified as operating leases and were not presented on our consolidated balance sheet. Implementation of ASC 842 has required additional investments and may require incremental resources and system configurations that could increase our operating costs in future periods. If we are not able to properly implement ASC 842 in a timely manner, the operating costs that we recognize and the related balance sheet and footnote disclosures that we provide under ASC 842 may not be accurately reported. Governmental action related to trade with China or other foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The U.S. government has indicated its intent to alter its approach to international trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements and treaties with foreign countries. In addition, the U.S. government has initiated or is considering imposing tariffs on certain foreign goods, and related to this action, certain foreign governments, including China, have instituted or are considering imposing tariffs on certain U.S. goods. It remains unclear what the U.S. government or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact our supply chain and foreign demand for our products and services and, thus, to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We and our subsidiaries have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment. As of December 31, 2018, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion, including $690.0 million outstanding of our 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the Senior Secured Notes) and $162.0 million outstanding of our 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Convertible Notes) and $237.8 million outstanding of our 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes, and together with the 2020 Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes). Subject to certain limitations set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, as amended, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt in the future, which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks. The amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to: a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited, and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding notes may be impaired in the future; we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and which, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; 43 our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase; our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future; it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness; we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business units. We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all. We have from time to time evaluated, and we continue to evaluate, our potential capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, limitations on bandwidth capacity and generally evolving technology in our industry. We may utilize one or more types of capital raising in order to fund any initiative in this regard, including the issuance of new equity securities and new debt securities, including debt securities convertible into our common stock. Since our IPO, we have obtained debt financing through our entry into our previous credit facility, issuance of Convertible Notes and issuance of Senior Secured Notes. Excluding the impact of such financing activities, we have not generated positive cash flows on a consolidated basis, and our ability to do so will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenue and manage costs in each of our three business segments. In addition, our ability to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and the timing of certain capital and other necessary expenditures are subject to numerous variables, such as costs related to international expansion and execution of our current technology roadmap, including continuing development of our 2Ku and ATG systems, and other potential future technologies. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, the indentures governing the Convertible Notes and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time. Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes is limited by the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining permitted indebtedness for Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and its subsidiaries was approximately $9 million. In the future, if our subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes does not prohibit Gogo Inc. from incurring additional indebtedness under any circumstances, but it does limit the amount of cash that our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to us to pay interest on the Convertible Notes or to pay interest on other indebtedness incurred by us, including indebtedness or preferred stock incurred to refinance, replace, renew or refund the Convertible Notes. The terms of any additional financing may further limit our financial and operating flexibility. Our ability to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Furthermore, if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are able to 44 obtain additional financing, we may be required to use the proceeds from any such financing to repay a portion of our outstanding debt. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company. In addition, any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and we may grant holders of such securities rights with respect to the governance and operations of our business. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on desirable terms or at all, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could result in a default on existing indebtedness or future indebtedness. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements and instruments governing our debt. In addition, we do not currently have a revolving credit facility under which we can borrow to make payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance any indebtedness. In the absence of such sources of capital, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes restricts our ability to dispose of assets and how we use the proceeds from any such dispositions. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to consummate those dispositions or, if we do, what the timing of the dispositions will be or whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet our debt service obligations, including amounts under the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Notes, when due. The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, us to: incur additional debt; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make certain investments; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate with other companies; and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. 45 Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under such agreements and instruments. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. All of these covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, may limit our ability in the future to satisfy currently outstanding obligations and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The Senior Secured Notes are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets. As a result of these security interests, such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our secured indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility. The Senior Secured Notes are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, if an event of default were to occur under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes would have a prior right to our assets, to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or reorganization. In that event, our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness. Only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders. The pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility. We may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes, to repay the Convertible Notes at maturity or to purchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, and the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes may limit our ability to pay interest, or dividends, on indebtedness, or preferred stock, issued to refinance the Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change purchase date. In addition, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share). Moreover, we will be required to repay the 2020 Convertible Notes in cash on March 1, 2020, their maturity date, unless earlier converted or repurchased. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or repay the Convertible Notes at maturity or upon Convertible Notes being converted. The indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes also does not allow our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us for the payment of the principal of the Convertible Notes. In addition, the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes limits the amount of cash our subsidiaries may dividend, transfer or otherwise distribute to us, including cash distributed to pay interest on the Convertible Notes or to pay any interest on other indebtedness incurred by us, including indebtedness or preferred stock incurred to refinance, replace, renew or refund the Convertible Notes, which may limit our ability to issue debt or other 46 securities in an amount necessary to refinance the outstanding Convertible Notes or at rates that such distributions could support. While we have reserved a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes to fund a portion of future interest payments on the 2022 Convertible Notes, the amount of such funds, together with funds up-streamed from subsidiaries and from other potential sources of liquidity (if any) may not be adequate to fund any future liquidity shortfall. See  We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing to fund our capital needs on acceptable terms, or at all . Our failure to purchase Convertible Notes required by the indentures governing the Convertible Notes or to pay cash payable upon future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indentures governing the Convertible Notes would constitute a default under the indentures governing the Convertible Notes. A default under the indentures governing the Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the agreements and instruments governing our other indebtedness and the acceleration of amounts outstanding thereunder, including the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. A default under the indentures governing the Convertible Notes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. The change of control repurchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company. The terms of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Notes require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Notes, respectively, in the event of a change of control. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Convertible Notes to require our subsidiaries or us, respectively, to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes or the Convertible Notes, respectively. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the rating assigned by a rating agency to us, our subsidiaries or our indebtedness, if any, could cause our cost of capital to increase. The Senior Secured Notes have been rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and may in the future be rated by additional rating agencies. We cannot assure you that any rating assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agencys judgment, circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, so warrant. Any future lowering of ratings may make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline. The trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our IPO, which occurred on June 21, 2013 and in which shares of common stock were sold at a price of $17.00 per share. From the IPO date through February 8, 2019, the price of our common stock has ranged from a closing low of $2.93 per share to a closing high of $34.34 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. They include: airline industry or general market conditions; domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance; 47 changes in technology or customer usage of Wi-Fi and Internet broadband services; any inability to timely and efficiently roll out 2Ku, 2.4 GHz or other components of our technology roadmap; any inability to sufficiently execute our international growth strategy; any inability to obtain satellite service on commercially reasonable terms or at all, currently and in the future; new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance; changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts; action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales; short-selling or other transactions involving derivatives of our securities; speculation in the press or investment community; investor perception of us and our industry; changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies; announcements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships; developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including increases or decreases in litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants; failure to complete significant sales; any future sales of our common stock or other securities; renewal of our FCC license and our ability to obtain additional spectrum; and additions or departures of key personnel. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many such companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adjustments by holders of the Convertible Notes of their hedging positions in our common stock and the forward stock purchase transactions, or any modifications of the forward stock purchase transactions, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Any buying or selling of shares of our common stock by holders of the Convertible Notes to establish or adjust hedged positions with respect to our common stock may affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may also encourage short selling by market participants because any conversions of the Convertible Notes could depress our common stock price. The price of our common stock 48 could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Convertible Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation, and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity which we expect to occur involving our common stock. In March 2015, in connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated prepaid forward stock purchase transactions (the Forward Transactions) with certain financial institutions (the Forward Counterparties). The Forward Transactions are generally expected to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions, including swaps, between the Forward Counterparties and investors in the 2020 Convertible Notes relating to shares of our common stock by which investors in the 2020 Convertible Notes will establish short positions relating to shares of our common stock and otherwise hedge their investments in the 2020 Convertible Notes. The maturity date of such Forward Transactions is on or around March 1, 2020, the maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes. Such investors may enter into other transactions in connection with or in addition to such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of shares of our common stock. As a result of the existence of the Forward Transactions, such derivative transactions and any related market activity could cause more purchases or sales of shares of our common stock over the term of the Forward Transactions than there otherwise would have been had we not entered into the Forward Transactions. Such purchases or sales, including sales made in connection with any refinancing or repurchase of our 2020 Convertible Notes, could potentially increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) or decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. In addition, in connection with any repurchase of our 2020 Convertible Notes, any Forward Counterparty may elect to settle a portion of its Forward Transaction early in accordance with its terms, which would result in a delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us earlier than the applicable maturity date described above. In addition, we may request that any Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of its Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of its Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, such Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by such Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The Forward Counterparties are not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request for any Forward Counterparty to effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the applicable Forward Counterparty on such terms as we may agree with such Forward Counterparty at the time. Additionally, the Forward Counterparties (or their respective affiliates) are likely to modify their hedge positions in respect of the Forward Transactions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to shares of our common stock and/or by purchasing the shares of common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the Forward Transactions (and are likely to do so during the final valuation period under the Forward Transactions and on or around any election by a Forward Counterparty to settle all of a portion of its Forward Transaction early). The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock. The Forward Counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Forward Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Forward Counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a Forward Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that Forward 49 Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a Forward Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. Conversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the Convertible Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Future stock issuances could cause substantial dilution and a decline in our stock price. We may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangement or otherwise. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and other equity incentives and the conversion of Convertible Notes. We may reserve additional shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or other similar forms of equity incentives. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If securities or industry analysts covering Gogo downgrade our stock or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Our President and CEO is a significant stockholder and could exert influence over our company, and if the ownership of our common stock continues to be concentrated, or becomes more concentrated in the future, it could prevent our other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. As of December 31, 2018, Oakleigh Thorne, our President and CEO and a member of our Board of Directors, and the entities affiliated with Mr. Thorne (the Thorne Entities) beneficially owned approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Thorne is able to exercise influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval for the foreseeable future, including approval of significant corporate transactions and the election of directors. Such ability to influence may reduce the market price of our common stock. As our President and CEO, Mr. Thorne has control over our day-to-day management and the implementation of major strategic initiatives and investments by our company, subject to authorization and oversight by our Board of Directors. As a member of our Board of Directors, Mr. Thorne owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Thorne is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interest, which may not always be in the interests of stockholders generally. 50 Our corporate governance guidelines address potential conflicts between a directors interests and our interests, and our code of business conduct, among other things, requires our employees and directors to avoid actions or relationships that might conflict or appear to conflict with their job responsibilities or our interests and to disclose their outside activities, financial interests or relationships that may present a possible conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict to management or corporate counsel. These corporate governance guidelines and code of business ethics do not, by themselves, prohibit transactions with the Thorne Entities. Fulfilling our obligations associated with being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley), is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price. As a public company, Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, as well as Nasdaq rules, require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public company obligations requires us to devote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. Our business is complex and the accounting treatment for airline equipment and services transactions may vary depending on the business model that an airline selects. Ensuring that our business processes and systems evolve with the changing needs of the business creates challenges which may increase the risks we encounter in meeting our financial reporting obligations. We have hired additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company reporting experience and technical accounting knowledge. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increased auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. We are required under Sarbanes-Oxley to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act, to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation or the implementation of our financial system upgrade, may materially adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, Nasdaq, or other regulatory authorities. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, and certain provisions in our existing and any future credit facility could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include: Authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt; Establishment of a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which our board will be divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting; 51 A requirement that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote; A provision that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; A limitation on who may call special meetings of stockholders; A prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and A requirement of supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. These provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and growth of our business, and we do not expect to declare and pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, to the extent that we determine to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Furthermore, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership by non-U.S. citizens, including the power of our Board of Directors to redeem shares of our common stock from non-U.S. citizens. The Communications Act and FCC regulations impose restrictions on foreign ownership of FCC licensees, as described in the above risk factor, Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property and RegulationIf we fail to comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulations limiting ownership and voting of our capital stock by non-U.S. persons we could lose our FCC license. Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions that permit our Board of Directors to take certain actions in order to comply with FCC regulations regarding foreign ownership, including but not limited to, a right to redeem shares of common stock from non-U.S. citizens at prices at or below fair market value. Non-U.S. citizens should consider carefully the redemption provisions in our certificate of incorporation prior to investing in our common stock. These restrictions may also decrease the liquidity and value of our stock by reducing the pool of potential investors in our company and making the acquisition of control of us by third parties more difficult. In addition, these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to attract equity financing or consummate an acquisition of a foreign entity using shares of our capital stock. Regulations related to conflict minerals force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex. We are subject to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which requires us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain certain minerals and metals, known as 52 conflict minerals. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of certain of the materials used in the manufacture of components in our products and equipment. In addition, we have and will continue to incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Pr operties Currently, we lease approximately 259,205 square feet for our CA business and corporate headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, under a lease agreement that expires in 2028. We also lease approximately 25,888 square feet for our CA manufacturing facility in Bensenville, Illinois under a lease agreement that expires on August 31, 2019. Additionally, our lease for our BA business in Broomfield, Colorado is for 122,127 square feet and expires in 2029. We believe our facilities will be adequate for the foreseeable future. Legal P roceedings Linksmart Litigation On April 20, 2018, Linksmart Wireless Technology, LLC filed suit against us and eight of our airline partners in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that our redirection server and login portal infringe a patent owned by the plaintiff. We are required under our contracts with these airlines to indemnify them for defense costs and any liabilities resulting from the suit. The Court has stayed the suits against our airline customers pending resolution of the suit against Gogo. Linksmart has also filed suit against other defendants asserting the same patent. One of these defendants has filed an inter parties review against the asserted patent and must meet a certain threshold to continue. Linksmart sought to stay the suit against Gogo until the earlier of (i) a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office that the threshold for review has not been met and that the review may not continue or (ii) if the review continues, its resolution. We agreed and the court has granted our request to stay our case until the first to occur of such events. Cases against the other defendants have also been stayed pending the inter parties review. The outcome of the inter parties review and this matter overall is inherently uncertain. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Securities Litigation On December 10, 2018, two purported stockholders of the Company filed an amended putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division styled Pierrelouis v. Gogo Inc., naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation as defendants purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our securities from February 27, 2017 through May 4, 2018. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, alleging misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to our 2Ku antennas reliability and installation and remediation costs. The plaintiffs seek to recover from us and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. In accordance with Delaware law, we will indemnify the individual named defendants for their defense costs and any damages they incur in connection with the suit. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors and Officers insurance policy with respect to this suit. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Derivative Litigation - On September 25, 2018 and September 26, 2018, two purported stockholders of the Company filed substantively identical derivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern 53 District of Illinois, Eastern Division, styled Nanduri v. Gogo Inc. and Hutsenpiller v. Gogo Inc., respectively. Both lawsuits were purportedly brought derivatively on behalf of us and name us as a nominal defendant and name as defendants each member of the Companys Board of Directors, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and allege misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to our 2Ku antennas reliability and installation and remediation costs, as well as allegedly excessive bonuses, stock options, and other compensation paid to current Officers and Directors and excessive severance paid to former Officers. The two lawsuits were consolidated and are stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the Securities Litigation. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on our behalf, an unspecified amount of damages from the individual defendants. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors and Officers insurance policy with respect to these suits. No amounts have been accrued for any potential costs under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential costs. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any litigation or the potential for future litigation. Regardless of the outcome of any particular litigation and the merits of any particular claim, litigation can have a material adverse impact on our company due to, among other reasons, any injunctive relief granted, which could inhibit our ability to operate our business, amounts paid as damages or in settlement of any such matter, diversion of management resources and defense costs. Mine Safet y Disclosures Not applicable. 54 Par t II Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information for Common Stock Our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol GOGO since June 21, 2013. Holders of Record As of February 1, 2019, there were 49 stockholders of record of our common stock, and the closing price of our common stock was $4.16 per share as reported on the NASDAQ. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. Repurchases of Equity Securities None. Recent Sale of Unregistered Securities None. Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities None. Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans See Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters for information regarding securities authorized for issuance.

The graph assumes that $100 was invested at the market close on June 21, 2013 in our common stock, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite and assumes reinvestments of dividends, if any. The comparisons in the graph below are based upon historical data and are not indicative of, nor intended to forecast, future performance of our common stock. 56 Selected Financial Data The following tables present selected historical financial data as of and for the periods indicated. You should read this information together with Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data and other financial data for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated statement of operations data and other financial data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The historical financial statements have not been restated and are reported under the revenue accounting standard in effect for those periods. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, for further information. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the post-adoption impact of ASC 606 on equipment shipments, which are now fully recognized upon customer acceptance, and the accounting impact of one of our airline partners transitioning to the airline-directed model. Includes depreciation and amortization expense of $133.6 million, $145.5 million, $105.6 million, $87.0 million and $64.5 million, respectively, for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 excludes approximately 7.2 million shares that will be repurchased as a result of the Forward Transactions. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities. We define working capital as total current assets less total current liabilities. The increase as of December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increases in inventory. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for further information. Includes deferred financing costs of $17.1 million, $16.2 million, $16.3 million, $14.6 million and $11.3 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 58 M anagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described under Risk Factors in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Our fiscal year ends December 31 and, unless otherwise noted, references to years or fiscal are for fiscal years ended December 31. See Results of Operations. Company Overview Gogo (we, us, our) is the global leader in providing broadband connectivity solutions and wireless in-flight entertainment to the aviation industry. We operate through the following three segments: Commercial Aviation North America, or CA-NA, Commercial Aviation Rest of World, or CA-ROW, and Business Aviation, or BA. Services provided by our CA-NA and CA-ROW businesses include Passenger Connectivity, which allows passengers to connect to the Internet from their personal Wi-Fi-enabled devices; Passenger Entertainment, which offers passengers the opportunity to enjoy a broad selection of in-flight entertainment options on their personal Wi-Fi enabled devices; and Connected Aircraft Services (CAS), which offers airlines connectivity for various operations and currently include, among others, real-time credit card transaction processing, electronic flight bags and real-time weather information. Services are provided by CA-NA on commercial aircraft flying routes that generally begin and end within North America, which for this purpose includes the United States, Canada and Mexico. CA-ROW provides service on commercial aircraft operated by foreign-based commercial airlines and flights outside of North America for North American-based commercial airlines. The routes included in our CA-ROW segment are those that begin and/or end outside of North America (as defined above) on which our international service is provided. BA provides in-flight Internet connectivity and other voice and data communications products and services and sells equipment for in-flight telecommunications to the business aviation market. BA services include Gogo Biz, our in-flight broadband service, Gogo Vision, our in-flight entertainment service, and satellite-based voice and data services through our strategic alliances with satellite companies. Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations We believe that our operating and business performance is driven by various factors that affect the commercial airline and business aviation industries, including trends affecting the travel industry and trends affecting the customer bases that we target, as well as factors that affect wireless Internet service providers and general macroeconomic factors. Key factors that may affect our future performance include: costs associated with the implementation of, and our ability to implement on a timely basis our technology roadmap, upgrades and installation of our ATG-4 and 2Ku technologies, the technology to which our ATG network evolves and other new technologies (including technological issues and related remediation efforts and failures or delays on the part of antenna and other equipment developers and providers, some of which are single source, or delays in obtaining STCs including as a result of any government shutdown), the roll-out of our satellite services, the potential licensing of additional spectrum, and the implementation of improvements to our network and operations as technology changes and we experience increased network capacity constraints; 59 costs associated with, and our ability to execute, our international expansion, including modifications of our network to accommodate satellite technology, development and implementation of new satellite-based technologies, the availability of satellite capacity, costs of satellite capacity to which we may have to commit well in advance, and our ability to obtain and comply with foreign telecommunications, aviation and other licenses and approvals necessary for our international operations; costs associated with managing a rapidly growing company; costs associated with, and our ability to obtain, sufficient capacity for heavily-trafficked areas in the United States and internationally, the costs of which we may have to commit to well in advance; the pace and extent of adoption of our service for use on domestic and international commercial aircraft by our current and new airline partners and customers; the number of aircraft in service in our markets, including consolidation of the airline industry or changes in fleet size by one or more of our commercial airline partners or BA fractional ownership customers; the economic environment and other trends that affect both business and leisure aviation travel; the extent of passengers and aviation partners adoption of our products and services, which is affected by, among other things, willingness to pay for the services that we provide, the quality and reliability of our products and services, changes in technology and competition from current competitors and new market entrants; our ability to enter into and maintain long-term connectivity arrangements with airline partners and customers, which depends on numerous factors including the real or perceived availability, quality and price of our services and product offerings as compared to those offered by our competitors; the impact of a change in business models and contract terms on the profitability of our connectivity agreements with airline partners, including as a result of changes in accounting standards; our ability to engage suppliers of equipment components and network services on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms; costs and possible delays that we could incur if our supplier, ZTE, fails to comply with the settlement agreement between ZTE and the U.S. government or if continued security or other concerns result in a prohibition of or limitations on our doing business with ZTE; costs relating to the implementation of our ongoing integrated business planning process, including restructuring charges; continued demand for connectivity and proliferation of Wi-Fi enabled devices, including smartphones, tablets and laptops; changes in domestic or foreign laws, regulations or policies that affect our business or the business of our customers and suppliers; changes in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting telecommunications services, including those affecting our ability to maintain our licenses for ATG spectrum in the United States, obtain sufficient rights to use additional ATG spectrum and/or other sources of broadband connectivity to deliver our services, expand our service offerings and manage our network; and changes in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting aviation, including, in particular, changes that impact the design of our equipment and our ability to obtain required certifications for our equipment. Key Business Metrics Our management regularly reviews financial and operating metrics, including the following key operating metrics for the CA-NA, CA-ROW and BA segments, to evaluate the performance of our business and our 60 success in executing our business plan, make decisions regarding resource allocation and corporate strategies, and evaluate forward-looking projections. Commercial Aviation North America Aircraft online (at period end) Satellite ATG Total aircraft equivalents (average during the period) Net annualized average monthly service revenue per aircraft equivalent (net annualized ARPA) (in thousands) Commercial Aviation Rest of World Aircraft online (at period end) Total aircraft equivalents (average during the period) Net annualized ARPA (in thousands) Aircraft online. We define aircraft online as the total number of commercial aircraft on which our equipment is installed and service has been made commercially available as of the last day of each period presented. We assign aircraft to CA-NA or CA-ROW at the time of contract signing as follows: (i) all aircraft operated by North American airlines and under contract for ATG or ATG-4 service are assigned to CA-NA, (ii) all aircraft operated by North American airlines and under a contract for satellite service are assigned to CA-NA or CA-ROW based on whether the routes flown by such aircraft under the contract are anticipated to be predominantly within or outside of North America at the time the contract is signed, and (iii) all aircraft operated by non-North American airlines and under a contract are assigned to CA-ROW. Aircraft equivalents . We define aircraft equivalents for a segment as the number of commercial aircraft online (as defined above) multiplied by the percentage of flights flown by such aircraft within the scope of that segment, rounded to the nearest whole aircraft and expressed as an average of the month-end figures for each month in the period. This methodology takes into account the fact that during a particular period certain aircraft may fly routes outside the scope of the segment to which they are assigned for purposes of the calculation of aircraft online. 61 Net annualized average monthly service revenue per aircraft equivalent (ARPA). We define net annualized ARPA as the aggregate service revenue plus monthly service fees, some of which are reported as a reduction to cost of service revenue for that segment for the period, less revenue share expense and other transactional expenses which are included in cost of service revenue for that segment, divided by the number of months in the period, and further divided by the number of aircraft equivalents (as defined above) for that segment during the period, which is then annualized and rounded to the nearest thousand. Beginning with the three month period ended March 31, 2018, we changed the calculation of ARPA to be net of revenue share expense and other transactional expenses in order to better reflect the financial statement impact of revenues generated under both the turnkey model and airline-directed model. The amounts reported above for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reflect this change in methodology. ARPA for the CA-NA segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was originally reported as $140 thousand and $137 thousand, respectively. ARPA for the CA-ROW segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was originally reported as $214 thousand and $159 thousand, respectively. Business Aviation Aircraft online (at period end) Satellite ATG Average monthly service revenue per aircraft online Satellite ATG Units sold Satellite ATG Average equipment revenue per unit sold (in thousands) Satellite ATG Satellite aircraft online . We define satellite aircraft online as the total number of business aircraft for which we provide satellite services as of the last day of each period presented. ATG aircraft online. We define ATG aircraft online as the total number of business aircraft for which we provide ATG services as of the last day of each period presented. Average monthly service revenue per satellite aircraft online . We define average monthly service revenue per satellite aircraft online as the aggregate satellite service revenue for the period divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the number of satellite aircraft online during the period (expressed as an average of the month end figures for each month in such period). Average monthly service revenue per ATG aircraft online. We define average monthly service revenue per ATG aircraft online as the aggregate ATG service revenue for the period divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the number of ATG aircraft online during the period (expressed as an average of the month end figures for each month in such period). Units sold . We define units sold as the number of satellite or ATG units for which we recognized revenue during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized revenue on 34 AVANCE units that were previously deferred. Average equipment revenue per satellite unit sold . We define average equipment revenue per satellite unit sold as the aggregate equipment revenue earned from all satellite units sold during the period, divided by the number of satellite units sold. 62 Average equipment revenue per ATG unit sold. We define average equipment revenue per ATG unit sold as the aggregate equipment revenue from all ATG units sold during the period, divided by the number of ATG units sold. Key Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations The following briefly describes certain key components of revenue and expenses for the CA-NA, BA and CA-ROW segments, as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Revenue: We generate two types of revenue through each of our operating segments: service revenue and equipment revenue. For CA-NA and CA-ROW, pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we place our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines in order to deliver our service to passengers on the aircraft. We currently have two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. Under the airline-directed model, we have transferred control of the equipment to the airline and therefore the airline is our customer in these transactions. Under the turnkey model, while our airline partner generally has legal title to our equipment, we do not transfer control of our equipment to our airline partner and, as a result, the airline passenger is deemed to be our customer. Transactions with our airline partners under the turnkey model are accounted for as an operating lease of space on an aircraft. CA-NA and CA-ROW Service Revenue: CA-NA and CA-ROW revenue consists of service revenue primarily derived from connectivity services, and, to a lesser extent, from entertainment services and CAS. Connectivity is provided to our customers using both our ATG and satellite technologies. Airline-directed connectivity revenue : As noted above, under the airline-directed model, the airline is our customer and we earn service revenue as connectivity services are consumed directly by the airline or indirectly by passengers. Turnkey connectivity revenue (passenger connectivity): Under the turnkey model, passenger connectivity revenue is generated by services paid for by passengers, airlines and third parties. Passenger paid revenue represents point-of-sale sessions (which may be flight-based, time-based, multiple individual session packages (multi-pack) or subscriptions). Flight-based, time-based and multi-pack revenue is recognized when the sessions are used. Subscription revenue is recognized evenly throughout the subscription period, regardless of the number of times the customer uses the network. Third party and airline-paid revenue is generated by sales of connectivity services to airlines or third parties in sponsorship, wholesale, enterprise and roaming arrangements. Sponsorship revenue is recognized over the sponsorship term. Revenue from wholesale, enterprise and roaming arrangements is recognized as sessions are used by the passenger. Entertainment revenue: Entertainment revenue consists of entertainment services we provide to the airline for use by its passengers. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the airline. 63 CAS: CAS includes, among other things, real-time credit card transaction processing, electronic flight bags and real-time weather information. Revenue is recognized as the service is provided. BA Service Revenue: BA service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Equipment Revenue: Equipment revenue primarily consists of the sale of ATG and satellite connectivity equipment and the sale of entertainment equipment. CA-NA and CA-ROW recognize equipment revenue upon acceptance by our airline customers. BA recognizes equipment revenue when the equipment is shipped to OEMs and dealers. Equipment revenue also includes revenue generated by our installation of the connectivity or entertainment equipment on commercial aircraft, which is recognized when the installation is complete. Cost of Service Revenue: Commercial Aviation North America and Rest of World: Cost of service revenue for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments includes network related expenses (satellite network expenses, including costs for transponder capacity and backhaul, as well as data centers, network operations center and network technical support), aircraft operations, component assembly, portal maintenance, revenue share and transactional costs. Additionally, CA-NA network costs include the costs of operating and maintaining our ATG network, including backhaul, site leases and cell site operations. A significant portion of our ATG network costs are relatively fixed in nature and do not fluctuate directly with revenue. Network costs for the CA-NA segment include licensing expense for the Canadian ATG spectrum. Revenue share for CA-NA and CA-ROW consists of payments made to our airline partners under our connectivity agreements. Under the turnkey model, our airline partners make an upfront payment for our equipment and take legal title to such equipment. These upfront payments are accounted for as deferred airborne lease incentives and amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of cost of service revenue over the term of the agreement. Additionally, monthly service fees we receive from our airline partners under the turnkey model are accounted for as a reduction to our cost of service revenue. CA-NA and CA-ROW transactional costs include billing costs and transaction fees incurred internally and charged by third-party service providers. Business Aviation: Cost of service revenue for the BA segment consists of satellite provider service costs, transaction costs and costs related to network operations. We charge a portion of the CA-NA segments ATG network costs to the BA segment. This charge to the BA segment is based on the number of megabytes used by BA. Beginning in January 2019, the BA segment is now responsible for operating and maintaining our ATG network. 64 Cost of Equipment Revenue: Our cost of equipment revenue primarily consists of the purchase costs for component parts used in the manufacture of our equipment and the production, installation, technical support and quality assurance costs associated with the equipment sales. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses include the costs to design and develop next generation technologies and to obtain and maintain FAA and other regulatory certifications. This includes the development of ground and airborne systems, including customization of network and airborne equipment, along with the design of airborne system installation processes. Engineering, design and development expenses also include costs associated with the enhancement of existing products. Upon adoption of the revenue recognition standard on January 1, 2018, certification and other regulatory costs directly attributable to our airline-directed customers are capitalized and amortized over the life of the contract. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Commercial Aviation North America and Rest of World: Sales and marketing expenses for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments consist primarily of costs associated with cultivating our relationships with our airline customers and airline partners and attracting additional passengers as our customers. Sales and marketing activities related to the airlines include contracting with new airlines to offer our service on their aircraft, contracting to add additional aircraft operated by our existing airline partners to the installed fleet, joint marketing of our service with our airline partners and airline customers, program management related service launches and trade shows. Sales and marketing activities related to passengers include advertising and marketing campaigns and promotions as well as customer service related activities and product management. Business Aviation: Sales and marketing expenses for the BA segment consist of costs associated with activities related to customer sales (including sales commissions), advertising and promotions, product management, trade shows and customer service support related activities to end users. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses include staff and related operating costs of the business support functions, including finance and accounting, legal, human resources, administrative, information technology, facilities and executive groups. We allocate to our CA-ROW and BA segments certain corporate operating expenses incurred by the CA-NA segment that are shared by all segments. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation expense for both the CA-NA and BA segments includes depreciation expense associated with our office equipment, furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements. Additionally, depreciation expense for the CA-NA segment includes depreciation of our airborne equipment for the turnkey model and ground network-related equipment. Depreciation expense for CA-ROW primarily includes depreciation of our airborne equipment for the turnkey model and satellite network-related equipment. We depreciate these assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives that range from 3-25 years, depending on the assets being depreciated. Amortization expense includes the amortization of our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives that range from 3-10 years, depending on the assets being amortized. 65 Segment Profit (Loss) We measure our segments performance on the basis of segment profit (loss), which is calculated as net income (loss) attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain non-cash charges (including amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives, stock compensation expense, amortization of STC costs, the accounting impact of the transition to the airline-directed model, loss on extinguishment of debt and adjustment of deferred financing costs) and other income (expense). Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related exposures. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In some instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances results could differ significantly from our estimates. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies to which many of these critical estimates relate, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, long-lived assets and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Revenue Recognition: We account for revenue in accordance with ASC 606. Our CA-NA and CA-ROW airline-directed contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which primarily include the sale of equipment, installation services, connectivity services and entertainment services. For these contracts, we account for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocate the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which is based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer, if available. To the extent a good or service is not sold separately, we use our best estimate of the standalone selling price and maximize the use of observable inputs. The primary method we use to estimate the standalone selling price is the expected cost-plus margin approach. The contractual consideration used for allocation purposes includes connectivity and entertainment services, which may be based on a fixed monthly fee per aircraft or a variable fee based on the volume of connectivity activity, or a combination of both. Examples of variable consideration within our contracts include megabyte overages and pay-per-use sessions. We constrain our estimates to reduce the probability of a significant revenue reversal in future periods, allocate such variable consideration to the identified performance obligations and recognize revenue in the period the services are provided. Our estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated future performance, market conditions and our best judgment at the time. 66 A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect our estimated contract value. For example, estimates of variable revenue within certain contracts require estimation of the number of sessions or megabytes that will be purchased over the contract term. Estimated revenue under these contracts anticipates increases in take rates over time consistent with our historical experience. Our estimated contract revenue may differ significantly from our initial estimates to the extent actual take rates differ from our historical experience. As such, we regularly review and update our estimates and recognize adjustments under the cumulative catch-up method. Any adjustments under this method are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period identified and revenue for future periods is recognized using the new adjusted estimate. See Note 4, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. Long-Lived Assets: Our long-lived assets (other than goodwill and indefinite-lived assets which are separately tested for impairment) are evaluated for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Within the Commercial Aviation segment, certain of our turnkey airline contracts are in the early stages and subject to completion of certification and installation programs. Accordingly, we evaluate whether an indication of impairment exists for turnkey airline contracts based on our projected future cash flows associated with such contracts. When an indication of impairment exists, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets with the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. If the future net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, we then calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss is calculated by comparing the long-lived assets carrying value with its estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future discounted cash flows. We would recognize an impairment loss by the amount the long-lived assets carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted balance becomes the new cost basis and is depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of the asset. We also periodically reassess the useful lives of our long-lived assets due to advances and changes in our technologies. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and long-lived asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the long-lived assets and selecting discount rates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the nature of the estimates or assumptions used to evaluate whether an indication of impairment of long-lived assets exists. However, if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions used, we could experience an impairment triggering event and be exposed to losses that could be material. Stock-Based Compensation Expense: We account for stock-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award. We recognize this cost as an expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of stock options. Critical inputs into the Black-Scholes option-pricing model include: the annualized volatility of our common stock; the expected term of the option in years; the grant date fair value of our common stock; the option exercise price; the risk-free interest rate; and the annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock, which are estimated as follows: Volatility. We have not been a public company long enough to calculate volatility based exclusively on our own common stock. Therefore, the expected volatility is calculated as of each grant date based on a 67 weighting of our own common stock and reported data for a peer group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. While we are not aware of any news or disclosure by our peers that may impact their respective volatilities, there is a risk that peer group volatility may increase, thereby increasing the future compensation expense resulting from future option grants. We intend to increase the weighting of our company-specific volatility over time, relying less on our peer group, as additional historical data becomes available. Expected Term. The expected term of the stock options is determined based upon the simplified approach, allowed under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110, which assumes that the stock options will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. As we obtain data associated with future exercises, the expected term of future grants will be adjusted accordingly. Fair Value of Our Common Stock. The fair value of our common stock underlying the stock options and other stock-based awards was valued by reference to the publicly traded closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Option Exercise Price. The option exercise price was determined based on the publicly traded closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards previously granted. The inputs that create the most sensitivity in our option valuation are the volatility and expected term. See Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 68 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain data from our consolidated statements of operations. The information contained in the table below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Consolidated Statements of Operations Data (in thousands) Revenue: Service revenue Equipment revenue Total revenue Operating expenses: Cost of service revenue (exclusive of items shown below) Cost of equipment revenue (exclusive of items shown below) Engineering, design and development Sales and marketing General and administrative Depreciation and amortization Total operating expenses Operating loss Other (income) expense: Interest income Interest expense Extinguishment of debt Adjustment of deferred financing costs Other (income) expense Total other expense Loss before incomes taxes Income tax provision (benefit) Net loss 69 Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 Revenue: Revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Service Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Service Revenue Equipment Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Equipment Revenue Total Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Revenue Commercial Aviation North America: CA-NA revenue increased to $469.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $400.6 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in equipment revenue offset in part by a decrease in service revenue. Equipment revenue increased to $101.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $7.1 million for the prior year due to the post-adoption impact of ASC 606 for equipment during 2018, which is now fully recognized upon customer acceptance. Additionally, the transition to the airline-directed model by one airline in January 2018 increased equipment revenue by approximately $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the prior year; see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. A summary of the components of CA-NAs service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Passenger Connectivity revenue (1) Passenger Entertainment and CAS Total service revenue Includes non-session related revenue of $6.9 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 70 CA-NA service revenue decreased to $367.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $393.5 million for the prior year due to a decrease in connectivity revenue offset in part by an increase in Entertainment and CAS revenue. CA-NA Connectivity revenue decreased to $339.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $368.9 million for the prior year due to a decrease in passenger-paid revenue offset in part by an increase in airline-paid revenue, which was due primarily to the transition of one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model from the turnkey model and, to a lesser extent, an increase in third party-paid revenue. Under the turnkey model, we are required to pay each airline a percentage of the service revenue we generate from transactions with the airlines passengers. The revenue share expense is included within cost of service revenue. However, under the airline-directed model, we generate revenue directly from the airline and do not incur revenue share expense. Therefore, the decrease in service revenue under the airline-directed model is offset by a reduction to our revenue share expense within cost of service revenue. Service revenue also decreased due to the economic impact of the same airline partners transition to the airline-directed model. Additionally, CA-NA Connectivity revenue decreased due to the decommissioning of certain American Airlines aircraft during the year ended December 31, 2018 . Net annualized ARPA decreased to $111 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $114 thousand for the prior year. The connectivity take rate, which is the number of sessions expressed as a percentage of passengers, increased to 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with 8.3% for the prior year, reflecting increased passenger adoption including the impact of third party-paid and airline-paid offerings, primarily under the airline-directed model. Average revenue per session decreased to $6.97 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $10.33 for the prior year, due to shifts in product mix, third party-paid and airline-paid offerings primarily under the airline-directed model, as well as the economic impact of one of our airline partners transition to the airline-directed model, as discussed above. The increase in Entertainment and CAS revenue to $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with $24.6 million for the prior year was due to increased usage of Entertainment services under business-to-business arrangements with our airline partners. We expect service revenue for CA-NA to decrease in the near-term primarily due to the decommissioning of certain American Airlines aircraft in 2018 and 2019. As the recognition of CA-NA equipment revenue is a function of equipment installation schedules, equipment revenue will be driven by our ability to execute our existing airline partner contracts, as well as entering into new contracts. Business Aviation: BA revenue increased to $290.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $240.6 million for the prior year due to an increase in service and equipment revenue. BA service revenue increased 14.9% to $196.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $170.9 million for the prior year primarily due to more customers subscribing to our Gogo Biz (ATG) service. The number of ATG aircraft online increased 11.7% to 5,224 as of December 31, 2018, as compared with 4,678 as of December 31, 2017. BA equipment revenue increased 34.5% to $93.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $69.7 million for the prior year primarily due to an increase in ATG equipment revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we shipped 34 AVANCE units and recognized $4.9 million of previously deferred equipment revenue as part of a sales program that started in 2016 and for which we have now fully recognized all related deferred revenue under this program. 71 Commercial Aviation Rest of World: CA-ROW revenue increased to $134.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $57.9 million for the prior year, due to an increase in both service revenue and equipment revenue. CA-ROW service revenue increased to $66.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $53.5 million for the prior year, due to an increase in aircraft equivalents. Net annualized ARPA for the CA-ROW segment decreased to $149 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $192 thousand for the prior year due to new airline partners aircraft coming online during the year ended December 31, 2018. CA-ROW equipment revenue increased to $68.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $4.3 million for the prior year primarily due to the post-adoption impact of ASC 606 for equipment during the year ended December 31, 2018, which is fully recognized upon customer acceptance. We expect CA-ROW equipment revenue to decrease in the near-term due to an upgrade program that occurred in 2018, which will be completed in 2019, and a change in mix of airlines with equipment installations. Cost of Service Revenue: Cost of service revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total CA-NA cost of service revenue increased to $174.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $149.7 million for the prior year due to increases in satellite service fees, aircraft operations expenses, costs to remediate quality issues associated with our 2Ku technology and a decrease in the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives offset in part by a decrease in revenue share expense. The changes in amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives and revenue share was due primarily to the transition of one of our airline partners from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model. See Note 15, Leases, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred airborne lease incentives. Cost of service revenue was also impacted by a portion of our supply chain and production activities now being included as part of cost of equipment revenue due to an increase in airline-directed activity. BA cost of service revenue increased to $42.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $40.8 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased ATG units online and, to a lesser extent, an increase in satellite service fees. CA-ROW cost of service revenue decreased to $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $77.8 million in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in airline launch costs and network operations expenses. We expect cost of service revenue for CA-NA to plateau over time mainly due to increased satellite service fees for additional aircraft operating on our satellite network, offset by a reduction in operational costs. 72 As we expand our CA-ROW business, we expect to incur additional cost of service revenue in CA-ROW, reflecting increased satellite usage, operations and network related expenses. However, we expect to see increased utilization of our network as we install additional aircraft. Cost of Equipment Revenue: Cost of equipment revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Cost of equipment revenue increased to $222.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $58.6 million for the prior year. The increase in CA-NA for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with the prior year was due to an increase in equipment revenue, supply chain and production activities, which, prior to 2018, were included in cost of service revenue, and an increase in warranty reserves due to additional activity under airline-directed models. Additionally, the transition to the airline-directed model by one airline in January 2018 increased cost of equipment revenue by approximately $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the prior year; see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. The increase in BA was due to an increase in equipment revenue and changes in product mix. The increase in CA-ROW was due to the increase in equipment revenue and an increase in warranty reserves due to additional activity under airline-directed models. We expect that our cost of equipment revenue will vary with changes in equipment revenue. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses decreased 9.9% to $120.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $133.3 million for the prior year due to decreases in all three segments. Engineering, design and development expenses for the CA-NA segment included the recognition of approximately $17 million of expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, related to the development of our next generation ATG solution, primarily due to the achievement of a major milestone whereas we recognized approximately $2 million of similar expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, upon adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, certification and other regulatory costs directly attributable to our airline-directed customers are capitalized and amortized as part of engineering, design and development costs over the life of the contract. We expect consolidated engineering, design and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of consolidated revenue over time. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses decreased 8.1% to $58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $64.0 million for the prior year due primarily to a decrease in CA-ROW and CA-NA, due to the 73 shift from the turnkey model (business-to-customer) to the airline-directed model (business-to-business) offset in part by an increase in BA. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue was 6.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with 9.2% for the prior year. We expect consolidated sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of consolidated revenue over time. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses increased slightly to $94.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $93.7 million for the prior year. Consolidated general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue was 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with 13.4% for the prior year. We expect consolidated general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of consolidated revenue over time. Segment Profit (Loss): CA-NAs segment profit decreased 60.7% to $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $66.8 million for the prior year primarily due to the changes discussed above. BAs segment profit increased 40.6% to $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $99.4 million for the prior year primarily due to the changes discussed above. CA-ROWs segment loss decreased 11.6% to $94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $107.0 million for the prior year primarily due to the changes discussed above. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 8.2% to $133.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $145.5 million for the prior year due to accelerated depreciation expense for certain upgrades and decommission programs that started in the second half of 2017 and were completed in early 2018 and the transition of one of our airline partners from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model. We expect our depreciation and amortization expense to decrease in the future as a greater percentage of installations will be under the airline-directed model. Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Interest income Interest expense Loss on extinguishment of debt Other expense Total 74 Total other expense was $138.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with $109.7 million for the prior year. Interest expense increased due to higher average debt levels outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared with the prior year. See Note 8, Interest Costs, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our interest expense. The year ended December 31, 2018 also included the loss on extinguishment of debt related to the 2020 Convertible Notes, while the prior year had no such activity. We expect our interest expense to increase due to higher average debt outstanding and higher interest rates due to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes in November 2018 and the associated accretion expense and amortization of deferred financing fees. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 2.0% as compared with 1.1% for the prior year. An income tax benefit was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulting from a reduction in our valuation allowance of approximately $4.0 million due to the application of provisions of H.R. 1, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform), to our evaluation of our deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred an income tax benefit of $2.0 million, primarily due to the change in the U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of U.S. Tax Reform enacted in December 2017. See Note 14, Income Tax, for further details. We expect our income tax provision to increase in future periods to the extent we become profitable. Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Revenue: Revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Service Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Service Revenue Equipment Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Equipment Revenue Total Revenue: CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Revenue 75 Commercial Aviation North America: CA-NA revenue increased to $400.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $371.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to an increase in service revenue driven by Passenger Connectivity revenue offset in part by a decrease in equipment revenue. The increase in CA-NA Passenger Connectivity revenue was primarily due to an increase in connectivity take rate, which is the number of sessions expressed as a percentage of passengers, and an increase in the number of aircraft equivalents, offset in part by a decrease in average revenue per session. The connectivity take rate increased to 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with 6.6% for the prior year, reflecting increased passenger adoption including the impact of third party-paid and airline-paid offerings. Average revenue per session decreased to $10.33 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $12.31 for the prior year, due to shifts in product mix, third party-paid and airline-paid offerings. Net annualized ARPA increased to $114 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $108 thousand for the prior year. A summary of the components of CA-NAs service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Passenger Connectivity revenue (1) Passenger Entertainment and CAS Total service revenue Includes non-session related revenue of $6.7 million and $15.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily included within third party-paid revenue. CA-NA Passenger Connectivity revenue increased to $368.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $341.1 million for the prior year due to increases in third party-paid, airline-paid and passenger-paid revenue. Third party-paid revenue increased primarily due to increases in sponsorship, roaming, enterprise and wholesale revenue. Our airline-paid revenue increased due to new agreements with certain airline partners under which the airlines pay us for specified data usage, including data used by passengers and by airline crew members using connectivity services while in-flight. Passenger-paid revenue also increased due to higher demand but was somewhat limited by growth in third party-paid and airline-paid revenue, in line with our multiple payer strategy. The increase in Passenger Entertainment and CAS revenue to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $16.1 million for the prior year was due to increased usage of Passenger Entertainment services under business-to-business arrangements with our airline partners, as all Passenger Entertainment arrangements transitioned to business-to-business arrangements during the year, and increased use of CAS operational applications during 2017. CA-NA revenue was partially offset by a decrease in equipment revenue to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared with $14.3 million in the prior year period, due primarily to more equipment transactions under the airline-directed model (instead of the turnkey model) in the prior year period as compared with 2017. Business Aviation: BA revenue increased to $240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $199.6 million for the prior year primarily due to an increase in service revenue. 76 BA service revenue increased 28.6% to $170.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $132.8 million for the prior year primarily due to more customers subscribing to our Gogo Biz (ATG) service. The number of ATG aircraft online increased 12.1% to 4,678 as of December 31, 2017, as compared with 4,172 as of December 31, 2016. BA equipment revenue increased 4.4% to $69.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $66.8 million for the prior year due to an increase in ATG equipment revenue partially offset by a decrease in satellite equipment revenue. Under a sales program for AVANCE equipment that started in 2016, we had a remaining deferred equipment revenue balance of approximately $4.9 million as of December 31, 2017. This was in connection with a free upgrade program under which we shipped ATG and UCS equipment to customers who have a right to exchange that equipment for AVANCE equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we shipped 12 AVANCE units under this program and recognized $0.8 million of previously deferred equipment revenue. Commercial Aviation Rest of World: CA-ROW revenue increased to $57.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $25.4 million for the prior year, due to an increase in service revenue and to a lesser extent an increase in equipment revenue. CA-ROW service revenue increased to $53.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $24.2 million for the prior year, due to an increase in net annualized ARPA and to a lesser extent an increase in aircraft equivalents. Net annualized ARPA for the CA-ROW segment increased to $192 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $137 thousand for the prior year due to increased airline-paid passenger usage and the transition of one of our airline partners from the turnkey model in the prior year to the airline-directed model in 2017 due to specific provisions elected by the airline. CA-ROW generated equipment revenue of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $1.2 million for the prior year due to the transition of one of our airline partners from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model in the first quarter of 2017 due to specific provisions elected by the airline. Cost of Service Revenue: Cost of service revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total CA-NA cost of service revenue increased to $149.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $145.5 million for the prior year due to increases in network operations expenses (including satellite service fees) and aircraft operations expenses. These increases were partially offset by increases in the amortization of our deferred airborne lease incentives, monthly service fees and maintenance fees paid to us by certain of our airline partners, all of which reduce our cost of services. See Note 15, Leases, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred airborne lease incentives. 77 BA cost of service revenue increased to $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $35.0 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased ATG units online and an increase in the average network consumption per ATG unit online which resulted in higher ATG network service costs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in satellite service fees. CA-ROW cost of service revenue increased to $77.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $45.5 million in the prior year primarily due to increases in network operations expenses (including satellite service fees) and aircraft operations expenses as the business continues to grow. Cost of service revenue was further impacted by decreases in the amortization of our deferred airborne lease incentives and monthly service fees paid to us by certain of our airline partners, both of which reduce our cost of services. See Note 15, Leases, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred airborne lease incentives. Cost of Equipment Revenue: Cost of equipment revenue by segment and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : CA-NA BA CA-ROW Total Cost of equipment revenue increased to $58.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $48.7 million for the prior year. The increase occurred within the BA and CA-ROW segments offset in part by a decrease in the CA-NA segment. The increase in BA was due to an increase in equipment revenue, inventory reserves on certain products, the write-off of capitalized software and changes in product mix. The increase in CA-ROW was due to additional equipment transactions that qualify for sale treatment. The decrease in CA-NA was due to fewer equipment transactions that qualify for sale treatment. Engineering, Design and Development Expenses: Engineering, design and development expenses increased 37.8% to $133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $96.7 million for the prior year due to increases in all three segments. Engineering, design and development expenses for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments increased due to higher personnel expense and outside services in connection with the development of new products and technologies and obtaining STCs. Additionally, the increase in the CA-NA segment for the year was due to the recognition of approximately $17 million of expenses related to the development of our next generation ATG solution, primarily due to the achievement of major development milestones at different points during the year. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses increased 4.6% to $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $61.2 million for the prior year due to increases in the BA and CA-ROW segments, offset in part by a decrease in the CA-NA segment. Consolidated sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue was 9.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with 10.3% for the prior year. 78 General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses increased 10.6% to $93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $84.9 million for the prior year due to increases in all three segments, due primarily to increases in personnel related expenses. Consolidated general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue was 13.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with 14.2% for the prior year. Segment Profit (Loss): CA-NAs segment profit decreased 7.1% to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $71.9 million for the prior year primarily due to the changes as discussed above. BAs segment profit increased 20.0% to $99.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $82.9 million for the prior year primarily due to the changes as discussed above. CA-ROWs segment loss increased 22.1% to $107.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $87.6 million for the prior year primarily due the changes as discussed above. Depreciation and Amortization: Depreciation and amortization expense increased 37.7% to $145.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $105.6 million for the prior year due to the increase in the number of aircraft outfitted with our airborne equipment by our CA-ROW and CA-NA segments and accelerated depreciation expense for certain upgrade and decommission programs. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the accelerated depreciation expense. Other (Income) Expense: Other (income) expense and percent change for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in thousands, except for percent change) : Interest income Interest expense Loss on extinguishment of debt Adjustment of deferred financing costs Other (income) expense Total Total other expense was $109.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with $96.6 million for the prior year. Interest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the prior year periods due to higher average debt levels outstanding during the current year as compared with the prior year. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to the issuance of the Original Senior Secured Notes in June 2016, the January 2017 Additional Notes in January 2017 and the September 2017 Additional Notes in September 2017 (all as defined below in Liquidity and Capital Resources). The increase in interest expense associated with the Senior Secured Notes was partially offset by lower interest expense associated with the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility, which was repaid in full in June 2016. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. See Note 8, Interest Costs, in 79 our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our interest expense. The year ended December 31, 2016 included a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility and adjustment of deferred financing costs, while the current year did not include such activities. Income Taxes: We incurred an income tax benefit of $2.0 million with an effective tax rate of 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with an income tax provision of $1.3 million with an effective tax rate of (1.1%) for the prior year. The change to income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with income tax expense in the prior year is due primarily to the impact of the change in U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of U.S. Tax Reform enacted in December 2017. The difference between our effective tax rates and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets which is excluded from taxable income (loss). See Note 14, Income Tax, for further details. Non-GAAP Measures In our discussion below, we discuss certain non-GAAP financial measurements, including Adjusted EBITDA and Cash CAPEX as defined below. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Cash CAPEX for business planning purposes, including managing our business against internally projected results of operations and measuring our performance and liquidity. These supplemental performance measures also provide another basis for comparing period-to-period results by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items. These supplemental performance measurements may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash CAPEX are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP; when analyzing our performance with Adjusted EBITDA or liquidity with Cash CAPEX, as applicable, investors should (i) evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure, and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments, (ii) use Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative to, net loss attributable to common stock as a measure of operating results, and (iii) use Cash CAPEX in addition to, and not as an alternative to, consolidated capital expenditures when evaluating our liquidity. Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA represents net income (loss) attributable to common stock before income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization of other intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives, (iii) amortization of STC costs, (iv) the accounting impact of the transition to the airline-directed model, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt and (vi) adjustment of deferred financing costs. Our management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that, management believes, have less bearing on our operating performance, thereby highlighting trends in our core business which may not otherwise be apparent. It also provides an assessment of controllable expenses, which are indicators management uses to determine whether current spending decisions need to be adjusted in order to meet financial goals and achieve optimal financial performance. We believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense from Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate given the significant variation in expense that can result from using the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of such compensation. The fair value of our stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model and varies based on fluctuations in the assumptions used in this model, including inputs that are not necessarily directly related to the performance of our business, such as the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options. Therefore, we believe the exclusion of this cost provides a clearer view of the 80 operating performance of our business. Further, stock option grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time. While we believe that investors should have information about any dilutive effect of outstanding options and the cost of that compensation, we also believe that stockholders should have the ability to consider our performance using a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these costs and that management uses to evaluate our business. We believe the exclusion of the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives and amortization of STC costs from Adjusted EBITDA is useful as it allows an investor to view operating performance across time periods in a manner consistent with how management measures segment profit and loss (see Note 11, Business Segments and Major Customers, for a description of segment profit (loss) in our consolidated financial statements). Management evaluates segment profit and loss in this manner, excluding the amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives and amortization of STC costs, because such presentation reflects operating decisions and activities from the current period, without regard to the prior period decision or the form of connectivity agreements. See Key Components of Consolidated Statements of OperationsCost of Service RevenueCommercial Aviation North America and Rest of World for a discussion of the accounting treatment of deferred airborne lease incentives. We believe it is useful for an understanding of our operating performance to exclude the accounting impact of the transition by one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model, the loss on extinguishment of debt and the adjustment of deferred financing costs from Adjusted EBITDA because of the non-recurring nature of these activities. We also present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides investors, securities analysts and other users of our financial statements with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management. Cash CAPEX represents capital expenditures net of airborne equipment proceeds received from the airlines. We believe Cash CAPEX provides a more representative indication of our liquidity requirements with respect to capital expenditures, as under certain agreements with our airline partners we are reimbursed for all or a substantial portion of the cost of our airborne equipment, thereby reducing our cash capital requirements. 81 Gogo Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (in thousands, except per share amounts) (unaudited) Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss attributable to common stock (GAAP) Interest expense Interest income Income tax provision (benefit) Depreciation and amortization EBITDA Stock-based compensation expense Amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives Amortization of STC costs Transition to airline-directed model Loss on extinguishment of debt Adjustment of deferred financing costs Adjusted EBITDA Cash CAPEX: Consolidated capital expenditures (GAAP) (1) Change in deferred airborne lease incentives (2) Amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives (2) Cash CAPEX See consolidated statements of cash flows. Excludes deferred airborne lease incentives associated with STCs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as STC costs are expensed as incurred as part of Engineering, Design and Development for turnkey model airline contracts. Material limitations of Non-GAAP measures Although EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash CAPEX are measurements frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash CAPEX each have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest income or expense; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for our income taxes; EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect depreciation and amortization, which are significant and unavoidable operating costs given the level of capital expenditures needed to maintain our business; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash components related to employee compensation; Cash CAPEX does not reflect the full extent of capital investments we have made in our operations; and 82 Other companies in our or related industries may calculate these measures differently from the way we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities Net cash provided by financing activities Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the beginning of period Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of period Supplemental information: Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of period Less: current restricted cash Less: non-current restricted cash Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period Short-term investments We have historically financed our growth and cash needs primarily through the issuance of common stock, non-convertible debt, senior convertible preferred stock, convertible debt, term facilities and cash from operating activities. We continually evaluate our ongoing capital needs in light of increasing demand for our services, capacity requirements, evolving technologies in our industry and related strategic, operational and technological opportunities. We actively consider opportunities to raise additional capital in the public and private markets utilizing one or more of the types of capital raising transactions through which we have historically financed our growth and cash needs, as well as other means of capital raising not previously used by us. Senior Secured Notes On June 14, 2016 (the Issue Date), Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (GIH) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (the Co-Issuer and, together with GIH, the Issuers), issued $525 million aggregate principal amount of 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the Original Senior Secured Notes) under an Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2016 (the Original Indenture), among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the Subsidiary Guarantors and, together with us, the Guarantors), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the Trustee) and as collateral agent (in such capacity, the Collateral Agent). On January 3, 2017, the Issuers issued $65 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the January 2017 Additional Notes). The January 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 108% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $70.2 million. On September 20, 2017, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the Supplemental Indenture and, together with the Original Indenture, the Indenture) to modify certain covenants, as discussed below. On September 25, 83 2017, the Issuers issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the September 2017 Additional Notes). The September 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 113% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $113.0 million. Additionally, we received approximately $2.9 million for interest that accrued from July 1, 2017 through September 24, 2017, which was paid when we paid in full our January 2018 interest payment in January 2018. We refer to the Original Senior Secured Notes, the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes collectively as the Senior Secured Notes. As noted above, on September 20, 2017, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the Supplemental Indenture to (i) increase the amount of additional secured indebtedness under the Credit Facilities (as defined in the Indenture) that may be incurred by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) under the Indenture by $100 million (from $75 million to $175 million in aggregate principal amount), (ii) permit the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional secured indebtedness in connection with vendor financing arrangements not to exceed $50 million in aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding and (iii) permit the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to make additional dividends or distributions to Gogo in an aggregate amount of up to $15 million during any twelve-month period to pay interest on any indebtedness or preferred stock with a maturity later than July 1, 2022. The Supplemental Indenture became effective immediately upon execution, following our receipt of consents from holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Notes (excluding Existing Notes held by the Issuers or any affiliates of the Issuers) to the Supplemental Indenture and amendments to the collateral agency agreement governing the Senior Secured Notes (the Consent Solicitation). In connection with the Consent Solicitation, GIH paid $1.4 million in fees (Consent Fees) to holders of Existing Notes who validly tendered (and did not revoke) their consents prior to the expiration of the Consent Solicitation. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes was $690.0 million and $690.0 million, respectively, the unamortized debt premium and Consent Fees were $12.7 million and $15.5 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount was $702.7 million and $705.5 million, respectively. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes accrues at the rate of 12.500% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, which commenced on January 1, 2017 (other than the January 2017 Additional Notes, for which interest payments commenced on July 1, 2017, and the September 2017 Additional Notes, for which interest payments commenced on January 1, 2018). The Senior Secured Notes mature on July 1, 2022. The January 2017 Additional Notes and September 2017 Additional Notes have the same terms as the Original Senior Secured Notes, except with respect to the issue date and issue price, and are treated as a single series for all purposes under the Indenture and the security documents that govern the Senior Secured Notes. We paid approximately $11.4 million, $2.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of aggregate origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the Original Senior Secured Notes, the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs. Additionally, as noted above, we paid approximately $1.4 million of Consent Fees, which partially offset the net carrying value of the Senior Secured Notes. The deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet are being amortized over the contractual term of the Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $2.6 million, $2.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Senior Secured Notes was $10.0 million and $12.6 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The Senior Secured Notes are the senior secured indebtedness of the Issuers and are: effectively senior to all of the Issuers existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and the Issuers indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the Senior 84 Secured Notes, if any, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes; effectively senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes; effectively equal in right of payment with the Issuers existing and future (i) unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes; structurally senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, including our Convertible Notes (as defined below); and structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-Guarantors (other than the Issuers). The Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed, on a senior secured basis, by us and all of GIHs existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer), subject to certain exceptions. The Issuers obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are not guaranteed by Gogo International Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of ours that holds no material assets other than equity interests in our foreign subsidiaries. Each guarantee is a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor and is: effectively senior to all of such Guarantors existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and such Guarantors indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral, if any, securing the guarantee of such Guarantor, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such guarantee; effectively senior in right of payment to all of such Guarantors future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantors guarantee; effectively equal in right of payment with all of such Guarantors existing and future (i) unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantors guarantee, and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral, if any, securing the guarantee of such Guarantor, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing such guarantee; and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-Guarantor subsidiary of such Guarantor (excluding, in the case of our guarantee, the Issuers). The Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on substantially all of the Issuers and the Guarantors assets, except for certain excluded assets, including pledged equity interests of the Issuers and all of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes. The security interests in certain collateral may be released without the consent of holders of the Senior Secured Notes if such collateral is disposed of in a transaction that complies with the Indenture and related security agreements. In addition, under certain circumstances, we and the Guarantors have the right to transfer certain intellectual property assets that on the Issue Date constitute collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes or the guarantees to a restricted subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland, resulting in the release of such collateral without consent of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. On or after July 1, 2019, the Issuers may, at their option, at any time or from time to time, redeem any of the Senior Secured Notes in whole or in part. The Senior Secured Notes will be redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record 85 date on or prior to the redemption date to receive interest due on an interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period commencing on July 1 of the following years: 2019 2020 2021 and thereafter In addition, at any time prior to July 1, 2019, the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 112.500% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of redemption; provided, however , that Senior Secured Notes representing at least 65% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption. The Issuers may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to July 1, 2019, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus the make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption date. The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors and, in certain circumstances, our ability, to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers or make other intercompany transfers; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain transactions with the Issuers affiliates, including us. Most of these covenants will cease to apply if, and for as long as, the Senior Secured Notes have investment grade ratings from both Moodys Investment Services, Inc. and Standard & Poors. If we or the Issuers undergo specific types of change of control prior to July 1, 2022, GIH is required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all of the Senior Secured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. The Indenture provides for events of default, which, if any of them occur, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes issued under the Indenture to be due and payable immediately. As of December 31, 2018, no event of default had occurred. Convertible Notes 2022 Convertible Notes On November 21, 2018, we issued $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances described below. Upon maturity, we have the option to settle our obligation through cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest payments begin on May 15, 2019. The $237.8 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $188.7 million and additional paid-in capital (the 86 equity component) at $49.1 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, we must settle the 2022 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2022 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 13.6%. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal on the 2022 Convertible Notes was $237.8 million, the unamortized debt discount was $47.7 million and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $190.1 million. We incurred approximately $8.1 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, of which $6.4 million and $1.7 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The $6.4 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2022 Convertible Notes was $6.2 million and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.00 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we currently expect to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes then outstanding. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, we currently expect to deliver shares of our common stock. We may elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Holders may convert the 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time prior to January 15, 2022, but only in the following circumstances: during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day; during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2022 Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2022 Convertible Notes on each such trading day; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of the above events allowing for conversion prior to January 15, 2022 occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2022 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after January 15, 2022 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2022. 87 In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2022 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. 2020 Convertible Notes On March 3, 2015, we issued $340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Convertible Notes) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $21.9 million was subsequently exercised during March 2015, resulting in a total issuance of $361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes mature on March 1, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances described below. Upon maturity, we have the option to settle our obligation through cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We pay interest on the 2020 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest payments began on September 1, 2015. During November 2018, we repurchased $199.9 million of outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes. As a result of the repurchase, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes were accreted up $17.9 million to face value. Additionally, we expensed $1.3 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and paid $0.5 million of fees in connection with the repurchase. These three items comprise the loss on extinguishment of debt of $19.7 million in our consolidated statement of operations. The $361.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $261.9 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $100.0 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, we must settle the 2020 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2020 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2020 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 11.5%. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding principal on the 2020 Convertible Notes was $162.0 million and $361.9 million, respectively, the unamortized debt discount was $12.8 million and $50.4 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $149.2 million and $311.5 million, respectively. We incurred approximately $10.4 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, of which $7.5 million and $2.9 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The $7.5 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2020 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Additionally, as noted above, we expensed $1.3 million of unamortized 88 deferred financing fees as a result of the repurchase. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2020 Convertible Notes was $0.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2020 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 41.9274 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.85 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we currently expect to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes then outstanding. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, we currently expect to deliver shares of our common stock. We may elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Holders may convert the 2020 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time prior to December 1, 2019, but only in the following circumstances: during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2020 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day; during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2020 Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2020 Convertible Notes on each such trading day; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of the above events allowing for conversion prior to December 1, 2019 occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2020 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after December 1, 2019 until maturity. In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2020 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2020 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2020 Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. Forward Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we paid approximately $140 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the Forward Transactions) with certain financial institutions (the Forward Counterparties), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. In the future, we may request that any Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of its Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of its Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, such Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by such Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ 89 Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The Forward Counterparties are not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request for any Forward Counterparty to effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the applicable Forward Counterparty on such terms as we may agree with such Forward Counterparty at the time. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders equity within our consolidated balance sheet was reduced by approximately $140 million. Approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock that will be effectively repurchased through the Forward Transactions are treated as retired shares for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding. Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility On July 30, 2014, GIH, Gogo Business Aviation LLC, f/k/a Aircell Business Aviation Services LLC (GBA), and Gogo LLC, as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers), entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement (the Amendment) to the Credit Agreement dated as of June 21, 2012 and amended on April 4, 2013 (the Amended Senior Term Facility) among the Borrowers, the lenders named therein, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. We refer to the Amendment and the Amended Senior Term Facility collectively as the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility. On June 14, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of $287.7 million, together with accrued and unpaid interest, was paid in full, and the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility was terminated in accordance with its terms on such date (subject to the survival of provisions expressly stated therein to survive the termination thereof). Additionally, we paid the voluntary prepayment premium of 3.0%, or $8.6 million, and wrote off all of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $6.8 million. Both of these items are included in loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated financial statements. We paid $22.2 million of loan origination fees and financing costs related to the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility, all but $4.1 million of which were accounted for as deferred financing costs. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, deferred financing costs related to the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility were written off as of June 14, 2016. Restricted Cash: Our restricted cash balances were $7.0 million and $7.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and primarily consist of letters of credit. Certain of the letters of credit require us to maintain restricted cash accounts in a similar amount, and are issued for the benefit of the landlords at our current office locations in Chicago, IL, Bensenville, IL and Broomfield, CO. Liquidity: Excluding the impact of our initial public offering, the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility, the 2022 Convertible Notes, the 2020 Convertible Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, to date we have not generated positive cash flows on a consolidated basis. However, although we can provide no assurances, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2018, will be sufficient to meet our obligations as they become due, and satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least one year from the date the 2018 financial statements are issued. We also believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating obligations, and satisfy future working capital and 90 capital expenditure requirements beyond one year from the date the 2018 financial statements are issued; however, payment of our long-term debt, including our 2020 Convertible Notes due March 1, 2020 at maturity, depends on our ability to obtain additional equity financing, incur additional indebtedness or consummate other potential strategic transactions. The Indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes contains covenants that limit the ability of GIH and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Additionally, the Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes limits the amount of cash GIH and its subsidiaries may distribute to us, including cash distributed to us to pay interest on the 2022 and 2020 Convertible Notes and pay any interest on other indebtedness incurred by us, including indebtedness or preferred stock to refinance, replace, renew or refund the 2022 and 2020 Convertible Notes. Further, market conditions and/or our financial performance may limit our access to additional sources of equity or debt financing, or our ability to pursue potential strategic alternatives. As a result, we may be unable to finance growth of our business to the extent that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash generated through operating activities prove insufficient or we are unable to raise additional financing through the issuance of additional equity, permitted incurrences of debt by us or by GIH and its subsidiaries, or the pursuit of potential strategic alternatives. Cash flows provided by (used in) Operating Activities: The following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating activities for the periods set forth below (in thousands) : Net loss Non-cash charges and credits Changes in operating assets and liabilities Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities For the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in operating activities was $82.3 million as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $60.3 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the decrease in operating cash flows were: A $139.2 million decrease in cash flows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from: The decrease in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities due to the following: Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs inventories as we now allocate a portion of our uninstalled airborne equipment to inventory and also an increase in BAs inventory due to builds during the year. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for additional information regarding inventory. Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs contract assets due to activity under airline-directed models during the year ended December 31, 2018 (see Note 4, Revenue Recognition, for additional information); Changes in all three segments deferred revenue as deferred revenue decreased during 2018 but increased in 2017; Changes in all three segments accounts payable, accrued liabilities and prepaid and other expenses due primarily to the timing of payments; Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs deferred airborne lease incentives due to more installations under the turnkey model in 2017 as compared with 2018, as airlines are 91 transitioning to the airline-directed model and as new airlines are also being signed under the airline-directed model; and Changes in CA-ROWs accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of collections. Partial offsets to the above due to increases in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities due to the following: Changes in CA-NAs and BAs accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of collections; and Changes in CA-NAs and CA-ROWs warranty reserves, due to more activity under our airline-directed model during the year ended December 31, 2018 (see Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for additional information). For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $60.3 million as compared with $65.0 million for the prior year. The principal contributors to the decrease in operating cash flows were: A $18.1 million change in net loss adjusted for non-cash charges and credits that was due primarily to increases in the CA-NA, BA and CA-ROW segments service revenues more than offset by increased spending in all three segments, as noted above under Results of Operations. Offset in part by a $13.3 million increase in cash flows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from: An increase in cash flows for operating assets and liabilities is due to the following: Changes in BAs inventory due to inventory builds throughout 2016 while inventory decreased during 2017; Changes in all three segments prepaid expenses and other current assets. The change in CA-NA was due to the recognition of development services during 2017 that were paid for in 2016. The change in BA was due to deposits made on certain inventory items during the first quarter of 2016, while no such payments were made during 2017. The change in CA-ROW was due to the timing of payments on satellite services; Changes in all three segments accrued liabilities and CA-NA and CA-ROWs accounts payable due primarily to the timing of payments; Changes in CA-ROWs deferred revenue as deferred revenue balances increased more during 2017 than in 2016; and Changes in CA-NAs deferred airborne lease incentives due to more installations at higher amounts during 2017 as compared with 2016. Partial offsets to the above due to decreases in cash flows for operating assets and liabilities due to the following: Changes in accrued interest due to accrued interest balances increasing more in 2016 than in 2017, due to the issuance of the Original Senior Secured Notes in 2016 (which pay interest in January and July each year); Changes in CA-NAs and BAs deferred revenue as deferred revenue balances increased more during 2016 than in 2017; Changes in all three segments accounts receivable due to accounts receivable balances increasing more in 2017 than 2016 due to increased activity and the timing of collections; and Changes in CA-ROWs deferred airborne lease incentives due to more installations at higher amounts during 2016 as compared with 2017. 92 Cash flows provided by (used in) Investing Activities: Cash provided by investing activities was $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash used in investing activities was $157.4 million and $295.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Investing activities is comprised of capital expenditures related to airborne equipment for the turnkey model, software development, data center upgrades, cell site construction and build-out of our new office locations. Cash flows from investing activities were impacted by our allocation of a portion of our equipment purchases to inventory. See Capital Expenditures below. Additionally, investing activities includes net changes in our short-term investments of $173.5 million, $125.7 million and ($119.0) million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Cash flows provided by Financing Activities: Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $27.3 million primarily due to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes with gross proceeds of $237.8 million, offset in part by $200.4 million of payments to repurchase 2020 Convertible Notes (comprised of $199.9 million of outstanding principal and $0.5 million of fees), $8.1 million of debt issuance costs and capital lease payments of $2.3 million. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $174.9 million primarily due to the issuance of the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes with gross proceeds of $181.8 million, offset in part by the payment of debt issuance costs for the January 2017 Additional Notes and September 2017 Additional Notes of $3.6 million and capital lease payments of $3.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $201.1 million primarily due to the issuance of $525.0 million of the Original Senior Secured Notes, partially offset by the $310.1 million repayment in full of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (including the early prepayment penalty of approximately $8.6 million), the payment of debt issuance costs for the Original Senior Secured Notes of $11.5 million ($10.6 million related to the issuance of the Original Senior Secured Notes in June 2016 and $0.9 million related to the issuance of the January 2017 Additional Notes) and capital lease payments of $2.6 million. Capital Expenditures Our operations continue to require significant capital expenditures, primarily for technology development, equipment and capacity expansion. Capital expenditures for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments include the purchase of airborne equipment for the turnkey model, which correlates to the roll out and/or upgrade of service to our airline partners fleets. Capital spending is also associated with the expansion of our ATG and satellite networks and data centers. We capitalize software development costs related to network technology solutions, the Gogo platform and new product/service offerings. We also capitalized costs related to the build out of our new office locations. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were $131.7 million and $280.2 million, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to a decrease in airborne equipment purchases as a portion of our equipment purchases are now allocated to inventory (see Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts) and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in capitalized software. We expect capital expenditures to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a lower number of installations under the turnkey model. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $280.2 million and $176.9 million, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to an increase in airborne equipment purchases (as airborne equipment represented approximately 70% of our capital expense for the year ended December 31, 2017), primarily for the rollout of 2Ku. 93 Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual obligations (including those that require us to make future cash payments) as of December 31, 2018. The future contractual requirements include payments required for our operating leases and contractual purchase agreements (in thousands) . Contractual Obligations: Capital lease obligations Operating lease obligations Purchase obligations (1) 2022 Convertible Notes (2) Interest on 2022 Convertible Notes 2020 Convertible Notes (3) Interest on 2020 Convertible Notes Senior Secured Notes Interest on Senior Secured Notes Satellite transponder and teleport services Deferred revenue arrangements (4) Deferred airborne lease incentives (5) Other long-term obligations (6) Total As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding purchase obligations represented obligations to vendors to meet operational requirements as part of the normal course of business and related primarily to information technology, research and development, sales and marketing and production related activities. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for more information. The 2020 Convertible Notes mature on March 1, 2020. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for more information. Amounts represent obligations to provide services for which we have already received cash from our customers. Amounts represent the upfront payments made by our airline partners for our airborne equipment and payments for STCs. Upfront payments made pursuant to these agreements are accounted for as deferred airborne lease incentives which are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of cost of service revenue over the term of the agreement. Other long-term obligations consist of estimated payments (undiscounted) for our asset retirement obligations, network transmission services, obligations to certain airline partners, and Canadian ATG Spectrum License related payments related to the monthly C$0.1 million payment over the estimated 25-year term of the agreement, using the December 31, 2018 exchange rate. Other long-term obligations do not include $2.1 million related to our deferred tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of their timing. Contractual Commitments: We have agreements with vendors to provide us with transponder and teleport satellite services. These agreements vary in length and amount and, as of December 31, 2018, commit us to purchase transponder and teleport satellite services totaling approximately $98.9 million in 2019, $89.4 million in 2020, $76.9 million in 2021, $66.1 million in 2022, $58.6 million in 2023 and $159.0 million thereafter. We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase satellite-based systems, certifications and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the equipment or certifications, or as development services are provided. 94 Leases and Cell Site Contracts: We have lease agreements relating to certain facilities and equipment, which are considered operating leases. Additionally, we have operating leases with wireless service providers for tower space and base station capacity on a volume usage basis (cell site leases), some of which provide for minimum annual payments. See Note 15, Leases, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. The revenue share paid to our airline partners represents operating lease payments and are deemed to be contingent rental payments, as the payments due to each airline are based on a percentage of our CA-NA and CA-ROW service revenue generated from that airlines passengers, which is unknown until realized. As such, we cannot estimate the lease payments due to an airline at the commencement of our contract with such airline. Rental expense related to the arrangements with commercial airlines included in cost of service revenue is primarily comprised of these revenue share payments offset by the amortization of the deferred airborne lease incentive discussed above. See Note 15, Leases, in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. A contract with one of our airline customers required us to provide the airline customer with a cash rebate of $1.8 million in June 2018, which has not yet been paid. Indemnifications and Guarantees : In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors and Officers insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements, including our agreements with commercial airlines, pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement, other than operating leases, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our results of operations. See Note 15, Leases, in our consolidated financial statements. Quantitative a nd Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and our debt. We have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To achieve these objectives, our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments through a variety of securities, including U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Government Agency Securities, and Money Market Funds. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 primarily included amounts in bank deposit accounts and Money Market Funds. We believe that a change in average interest rates would not adversely affect our interest income and results of operations by a material amount. 95 The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. However, actual results may differ. Interest: Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest income generated from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, included amounts in bank deposit accounts and money market funds, and our short-term investments are made up of U.S. Treasury bills. We believe we have minimal interest rate risk; a 10% change in the average interest rate on our portfolio would have reduced interest income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 by an immaterial amount. Inflation: We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future. Seasonality: Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for any other interim period of the entire year because the demand for air travel, including business travel, is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect our overall passenger opportunity to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year due to an increase in leisure travel offset in part by a decrease in business travel during the summer months and holidays. We expect seasonality of the air transportation business to continue, which may affect our results of operations in any one period. 96 Fi nancial Statements and Supplementary Data Gogo Inc. Index to Consolidated Financial Statements Report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Consolidated Balance Sheets Consolidated Statements of Operations Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity (Deficit) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 97 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Gogo Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gogo Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , using the modified retrospective approach. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Chicago, Illinois February 21, 2019 We have served as the Companys auditor since 2007. 98 Gogo Inc.

Background Gogo (we, us, our) is the global leader in providing broadband connectivity solutions and wireless in-flight entertainment to the aviation industry. We operate through the following three segments: Commercial Aviation North America, or CA-NA, Commercial Aviation Rest of World, or CA-ROW, and Business Aviation, or BA. Services provided by our CA-NA and CA-ROW businesses include Passenger Connectivity, which allows passengers to connect to the Internet from their personal Wi-Fi-enabled devices; Passenger Entertainment, which offers passengers the opportunity to enjoy a broad selection of in-flight entertainment options on their personal Wi-Fi enabled devices; and Connected Aircraft Services (CAS), which offers airlines connectivity for various operations and currently include, among other services, real-time credit card transaction processing, electronic flight bags and real-time weather information. Services are provided by CA-NA on commercial aircraft flying routes that generally begin and end within North America, which for this purpose includes the United States, Canada and Mexico. CA-ROW provides service on commercial aircraft operated by foreign-based commercial airlines and flights outside of North America for North American-based commercial airlines. The routes included in our CA-ROW segment are those that begin and/or end outside of North America (as defined above) on which our international service is provided. BA provides in-flight Internet connectivity and other voice and data communications products and services and sells equipment for in-flight telecommunications to the business aviation market. BA services include Gogo Biz, our in-flight broadband service, Passenger Entertainment, our in-flight entertainment service, and satellite-based voice and data services through our strategic alliances with satellite companies. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the significant estimates and bases such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Reclassifications To conform to the current year presentation, certain amounts in our 2017 and 2016 consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified. Specifically, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, current deferred rent of $174 thousand and $73 thousand, respectively, has been combined with accrued liabilities, and non-current deferred rent of $798 thousand and $120 thousand, respectively, has been combined with other non-current assets and liabilities. Additionally, warranty reserves is now separately stated in its own line, which was included in accrued liabilities previously. Significant Risks and Uncertainties Our operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including without limitation those associated with continuing losses, fluctuations in operating results, funding of business expansion, strategic alliances, capacity constraints, managing rapid growth and expansion, relationships with customers, suppliers and distributors, financing arrangement terms that may restrict operations, regulatory issues, competition, the economy, technology trends and evolving industry standards. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments We consider cash and cash equivalents to be short-term, highly liquid investments that have the following characteristics: readily convertible to known amounts of cash, so near their maturities that there is insignificant risk of changes in value due to any changes in market interest rates, and having maturities of three months or less when purchased. We continually monitor positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which we invest. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets. 104 We consider short-term investments to be investments with maturities of twelve months or less (but greater than three months). Currently all our short-term investments are comprised of U.S. Treasury bills, which we intend to hold to maturity. Certain cash amounts are restricted as to use and are classified outside of cash and cash equivalents. See Note 7, Long-term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further details. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. All cash and cash equivalents are invested with creditworthy financial institutions. We perform ongoing credit evaluations and generally do not require collateral to support receivables. Our short-term investments are all comprised of U.S. Treasury bills. See Note 11, Business Segments and Major Customers, for further details. Income Tax We use an asset- and liability-based approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets which are not likely to be realized. On a regular basis, management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance. We also consider the existence of any uncertain tax positions and, as necessary, provide a reserve for any uncertain tax positions at each reporting date. See Note 14, Income Tax, for further details. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of telecommunications systems and parts, and are recorded at the lower of cost (average cost) or market. We evaluate the need for write-downs associated with obsolete, slow-moving and nonsalable inventory by reviewing net realizable inventory values on a periodic basis. Historically, inventories were solely related to the BA segment. Starting in 2018, the airborne equipment within our CA-NA and CA-ROW segments became increasingly deployed under airline-directed model agreements (see Revenue Recognition, below for additional details), and we now allocate uninstalled airborne equipment between property and equipment, net, and inventories, based on our forecasts of estimated future installations by contract type. Prior to this allocation, uninstalled airborne equipment for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments was classified as property and equipment, net, as the majority of installations were performed under our turnkey model agreements. See Arrangements with Commercial Airlines, below for additional information on the turnkey model treatment. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for further details. 105 Property and Equipment and Depreciation Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Network asset inventory and construction in progress, which include materials, transmission and related equipment, and interest and other costs relating to the construction and development of our network, are not depreciated until they are put into service. Network equipment consists of switching equipment, antennas, base transceiver stations, site preparation costs, and other related equipment used in the operation of our network. Airborne equipment consists of routers, modems, radomes, antennas and related equipment, and accessories installed or to be installed on aircraft under the turnkey model. Depreciation expense totaled $107.1 million, $120.6 million and $84.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for owned assets, which are as follows: Office equipment, furniture, fixtures and other Leasehold improvements Airborne equipment Network equipment See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for further details. Improvements to leased property are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Due to advances in technology and changes in agreements with our airline partners, with respect to upgrading equipment, we periodically reassess the useful lives of our property and equipment. Such reassessment has resulted in the useful life of specific assets being adjusted to a shorter period than originally estimated, resulting in an increase in annual depreciation expense for those assets. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Our FCC Licenses (as defined in Note 6, Intangible Assets) are our only indefinite-lived intangible assets. We perform our annual impairment tests of goodwill and our FCC Licenses during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of impairment. Our qualitative analysis includes, but is not limited to, assessing the changes in macroeconomic conditions, regulatory environment, industry and market conditions, financial performance versus budget and any other events or circumstances specific to goodwill and the FCC Licenses. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill and the FCC Licenses is greater than the carrying value, no further testing is required. Otherwise, we will apply the quantitative impairment test method. Our quantitative impairment testing of the FCC Licenses uses the Greenfield method, an income-based approach. When performing this quantitative impairment testing, we estimate the fair value of the goodwill and FCC Licenses asset balances based primarily on projected future operating results, discounted cash flows, and other assumptions. Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to, among other things, revenue growth and operating margins. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, projected operating results and cash flows may not always be achieved. The failure to achieve one or more of our assumptions regarding projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term could reduce the estimated fair value below carrying value and result in the recognition of an impairment charge. The results of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments for 2018, 2017 and 2016 indicated no impairment. 106 Intangible assets that are deemed to have a finite life are amortized over their useful lives as follows: Software OEM and dealer relationships Service customer relationships Other intangible assets See Note 6, Intangible Assets, for further details. Long-Lived Assets We review our long-lived assets to determine potential impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We do this by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. If we determine an impairment exists, the asset is written down to estimated fair value. There were no impairments of long-lived assets in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Arrangements with Commercial Airlines Pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we place our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines for the purpose of delivering our service to passengers on the aircraft. There are currently two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. See Revenue Recognition, below for additional information on the airline-directed model. Under the turnkey model, we account for equipment transactions as operating leases of space for our equipment on the aircraft. We may be responsible for the costs of installing and/or deinstalling the equipment. Under the turnkey model, the equipment transactions involve the transfer of legal title but do not meet sales recognition for accounting purposes because the risks and rewards of ownership are not fully transferred due to our continuing involvement with the equipment, the length of the term of our agreements with the airlines, and restrictions in the agreements regarding the airlines use of the equipment. Under the this model, we refer to the airline as a partner. Under the turnkey model, the assets are recorded as airborne equipment on our consolidated balance sheets, as noted in Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts. Any upfront equipment payments are accounted for as lease incentives and recorded as deferred airborne lease incentives on our consolidated balance sheets and are recognized as a reduction of the cost of service revenue on the straight-line basis over the term of the agreement with the airline. See Note 15, Leases, for further details. Transition to Airline-Directed Model The accounting treatment for one of our airline agreements transitioned from our turnkey model to our airline-directed model in January 2018 due to specific provisions elected by the airline that resulted in the transfer of control of the previously installed connectivity equipment. Upon transition to the airline-directed model, the net book value of all previously delivered equipment classified within property and equipment was reclassified to cost of equipment revenue. Additionally, the unamortized proceeds previously received for equipment and classified within current and non-current deferred airborne lease incentives were eliminated and included as part of estimated contract value, which was then allocated amongst the various performance obligations under the agreement. The value allocated to previously delivered equipment was immediately recognized as equipment revenue in our consolidated financial statements; see Revenue Recognition, below for additional disclosures relating to the allocation of consideration among identified performance obligations. For amounts recognized in equipment revenue that were in excess of the amounts billed, we recorded current and non-current contract assets included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other non-current assets, respectively; see Revenue Recognition, below for additional details. In connection with the transition of this airline agreement to the airline-directed model, we also established warranty reserves related to previously sold equipment that are still under a warranty period, which is included within accrued liabilities. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for additional 107 information. This transition from the turnkey model to the airline-directed model occurred on January 4, 2018 and the total financial statement effect on our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations was as follows ( in thousands ): Consolidated balance sheet Prepaid expense and other current assets Property and equipment, net Other non-current assets Accrued liabilities Current deferred airborne lease incentive Non-current deferred airborne lease incentive Consolidated statement of operations Equipment revenue Cost of equipment revenue Revenue Recognition Our revenue is primarily earned from providing connectivity and entertainment services and through sales of equipment. Additionally, to a lesser extent, we earn revenue from providing ancillary services, including installation and CAS. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; Determination of the transaction price; Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and Recognition of revenue as we satisfy the performance obligations. For CA-NA and CA-ROW, pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we place our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines in order to deliver our service to passengers on the aircraft. We currently have two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. Under the airline-directed model, we have transferred control of the equipment to the airline and therefore the airline is our customer in these transactions. Under the turnkey model, while our airline partner generally has legal title to our equipment, we do not transfer control of our equipment to our airline partner and, as a result, the airline passenger is deemed to be our customer. Transactions with our airline partners under the turnkey model are accounted for as an operating lease of space on an aircraft. See Arrangements with Commercial Airlines, above for additional information on the turnkey model. CA-NA and CA-ROW Service Revenue : CA-NA and CA-ROW revenue consists of service revenue primarily derived from connectivity services, and, to a lesser extent, from Entertainment services and CAS. Connectivity is provided to our customers using both our ATG and satellite technologies. Airline-directed connectivity revenue : As noted above, under the airline-directed model, the airline is our customer and we earn service revenue as connectivity services are consumed directly by the airline or indirectly by passengers. Turnkey connectivity revenue (passenger connectivity): Under the turnkey model, passenger connectivity revenue is generated by services paid for by passengers, airlines and third parties. 108 Passenger paid revenue represents point-of-sale sessions (which may be flight-based, time-based, multiple individual session packages (multi-pack) or subscriptions). Flight-based, time-based and multi-pack revenue is recognized when the sessions are used. Subscription revenue is recognized evenly throughout the subscription period, regardless of the number of times the customer uses the network. Third party and airline-paid revenue is generated by sales of connectivity services to airlines or third parties in sponsorship, wholesale, enterprise and roaming arrangements. Sponsorship revenue is recognized over the sponsorship term. Revenue from wholesale, enterprise and roaming arrangements is recognized as sessions are used by the passenger. Entertainment revenue: Entertainment revenue consists of entertainment services we provide to the airline for use by its passengers. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the airline. CAS: CAS includes, among other things, real-time credit card transaction processing, electronic flight bags and real-time weather information. Revenue is recognized as the service is provided. BA Service Revenue : BA service revenue primarily consists of monthly subscription and usage fees paid by aircraft owners and operators for telecommunication, data, and in-flight entertainment services. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customer. Equipment Revenue : Equipment revenue primarily consists of the sale of ATG and satellite connectivity equipment and the sale of entertainment equipment. CA-NA and CA-ROW recognize equipment revenue upon acceptance by our airline customers. BA recognizes equipment revenue when the equipment is shipped to OEMs and dealers. Equipment revenue also includes revenue generated by the installation of the connectivity or entertainment equipment on commercial aircraft, which is recognized when the installation is complete. Contract price and allocation considerations : Our CA-NA and CA-ROW airline-directed contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which primarily include the sale of equipment, installation services, connectivity services and entertainment services. For these contracts, we account for each distinct good or service as a separate performance obligation. We allocate the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price, which is based on the actual selling price for any good or service sold separately to a similar class of customer, if available. To the extent a good or service is not sold separately, we use our best estimate of the standalone selling price and maximize the use of observable inputs. The primary method we use to estimate the standalone selling price is the expected cost-plus margin approach. The contractual consideration used for allocation purposes includes connectivity and entertainment services, which may be based on a fixed monthly fee per aircraft or a variable fee based on the volume of connectivity activity, or a combination of both. Examples of variable consideration within our contracts include megabyte overages and pay-per-use sessions. We constrain our estimates to reduce the probability of a significant revenue reversal in future periods, allocate such variable consideration to the identified performance obligations and recognize revenue in the period the services are provided. Our estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated future performance, market conditions and our best judgment at the time. 109 A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect our estimated contract value, and we regularly review and update our estimates and recognize adjustments under the cumulative catch-up method. Any adjustment under this method is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period identified and revenue for future periods is recognized using the new adjusted estimate. Research and Development Costs Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred and totaled $72.7 million, $78.1 million and $45.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Research and development costs are reported as a component of engineering, design and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Software Development Costs We capitalize costs for network and non-network software developed or obtained for internal use during the application development stage. These costs include purchased software and direct costs associated with the development and configuration of internal use software that supports the operation of our service offerings. These costs are included in goodwill and intangible assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets and, when the software is placed in service, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Costs incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred. With respect to software sold as part of our equipment sales, we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility has been established. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product basis, based on the greater of the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product. Warranty We provide warranties on parts and labor related to our products. Our warranty terms range from two to ten years. Warranty reserves are established for costs that are estimated to be incurred after the sale, delivery and installation of the products under warranty. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence, and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for the details of the changes in our warranty reserve. Asset Retirement Obligations We have certain asset retirement obligations related to contractual commitments to remove our network equipment and other assets from leased cell sites upon termination of the site lease and to remove equipment from aircraft when the service contracts terminate. The asset retirement obligations are classified as a noncurrent liability in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5, Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts, for the details of the changes in our asset retirement obligations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We group financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value into three levels of hierarchy based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. See Note 10, Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities, for further information. Derivatives  In March 2015, we entered into a prepaid forward transaction in which we purchased 7.2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $140 million, with an expected settlement date on or around March 1, 2020. Because the transaction is indexed to our own stock and classified within stockholders equity, we do not account for the prepaid forwards as a derivative instrument in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815, Derivatives and Hedging . 110 See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, Note 9, Common Stock and Preferred Stock, and Note 10, Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities, for further information. Convertible Notes  Proceeds received from the issuance of 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities) are initially allocated between a liability component (long-term debt) and an equity component (additional paid-in capital), within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component is measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. Net Loss Per Share We calculate basic and diluted net loss per share using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. See Note 3, Net Loss Per Share, for further information. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Compensation cost is measured and recognized at fair value for all stock-based payments, including stock options. For time-based vesting stock options, we estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividends. Restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. For awards with a market condition (which we have used on a limited basis), we estimated fair value using the Monte Carlo Simulation model, which requires assumptions, such as volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life and dividends. Our stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the applicable vesting period, and is included in the same operating expense line items in the consolidated statements of operations as the base cash compensation paid to the underlying employees. See Note 12, Stock-Based Compensation, for further information. Leases In addition to our arrangements with commercial airlines which we account for as leases as noted above, we also lease certain facilities, equipment, cell tower space and base station capacity. We review each lease agreement to determine if it qualifies as an operating or capital lease. For leases that contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record any difference between the straight-line rent amounts and amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent, in either accrued liabilities or as a separate line within noncurrent liabilities, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. For leases that qualify as a capital lease, we record a capital lease asset and a capital lease obligation at the beginning of the lease term at an amount equal to the present value of minimum lease payments during the term of the lease, excluding that portion of the payments that represent executory costs. The capital lease asset is depreciated on a straight-line method over the shorter of its estimated useful life or lease term. See Note 15, Leases, for further information. Advertising Costs Costs for advertising are expensed as incurred. Debt Issuance Costs We defer loan origination fees and financing costs related to our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. Additionally, we defer fees paid directly to the lenders related to amendments with our various debt offerings as deferred financing costs. We amortize these costs over the term of 111 the underlying debt obligation using the effective interest method, and include them in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The fees incurred but not paid directly to the lenders in connection with amendments are expensed as incurred to interest expense. Deferred financing costs associated with future debt issuances are written off in the period during which we determine that the debt will no longer be issued. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities for further information. Comprehensive Loss - Comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is net loss plus unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Revenue recognition related new pronouncements: On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective method. As a result, we recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. Our historical financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the revenue accounting standard in effect for those periods. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, equipment revenue (and related cost) under some of our CA-NA and CA-ROW segment contracts was deferred and recognized over the life of the contract as the equipment and connectivity services did not meet the requirements to be treated as separate units of accounting. Under ASC 606, these same equipment transactions qualify as standalone performance obligations and, therefore, equipment revenue (and related cost) is recognized upon acceptance by our airline customers. Adoption of the new standard did not materially affect the amount or timing of equipment revenue recognized from our BA segment. Our service revenue across all segments continues to be recognized as the services are provided to customers. In conjunction with the adoption of ASC 606, we also adopted Accounting Standard Codification Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs  Contracts with Customers (ASC 340-40), which requires the capitalization of costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. Prior to the adoption of ASC 340-40, we expensed all fulfillment and other costs associated with airline-directed contracts, which were comprised predominantly of costs incurred to obtain supplemental type certificates (STCs); these costs are now required to be capitalized and amortized to expense over the life of the contract (and are included within engineering, design and development in our consolidated financial statements). Costs associated with our turnkey contracts are not eligible for capitalization under ASC 340-40 and will continue to be expensed as incurred. The cumulative effect of the adoption of ASC 606 and ASC 340-40 to our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018 was as follows ( in thousands) : Assets Inventories Prepaid expenses and other current assets Property and equipment, net Other non-current assets Liabilities Current deferred revenue Other non-current liabilities Equity Accumulated deficit 112 During the fourth quarter 2018, we identified an additional $0.9 million of property and equipment, net that should have been included in the transition adjustments as of January 1, 2018. The schedule above reflects the additional adjustment. See Note 4, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-04, Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products (ASU 2016-04), which amends the guidance on extinguishing financial liabilities for certain prepaid stored-value products by requiring that entities that sell prepaid stored-value products recognize breakage proportionally as the prepaid stored-value product is being redeemed rather than immediately upon sale of the product. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. All other new pronouncements: In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02), which introduces a lessee model that records most leases on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 also aligns certain underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in ASC 606, the FASBs new revenue recognition standard. Furthermore, ASU 2016-02 eliminates the required use of bright-line tests used in current GAAP for determining lease classification. It also requires lessors to provide additional transparency into their exposure to the changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. ASU 2016-02 required entities to adopt the new leases standard using a modified retrospective method and initially apply the related guidance at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements. During July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, which allows for an additional and optional transition method under which an entity would record a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of the period of adoption (cumulative-effect method). We will adopt this guidance as of January 1, 2019 using the cumulative-effect method. We have finalized implementation of a new lease accounting information system and continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate an increase in our assets and liabilities due to the recognition of the required right-of-use asset and corresponding lease obligations for leases that are currently classified as operating leases. The primary impact of ASU 2016-02 relates to our tower leases and base stations, and our leases of facilities and equipment. See Note 15, Leases, for further information on our lease arrangements. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which amends ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows , the FASBs standard for reporting cash flows in general-purpose financial statements. The amendment addresses the diversity in practice related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs. We adopted this guidance using the full retrospective method. Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have historically reported debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs in a manner consistent with ASU 2016-15. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which removes the prohibition in ASC 740, Income Taxes , against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This is intended to reduce the complexity of GAAP and diversity in practice related to the tax consequences of certain types of intra-entity asset transfers, particularly those involving intellectual property. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash  A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2016-18), which amends ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows , to clarify guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows using the full retrospective method. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See 113 our consolidated statements of cash flows for the reconciliation of cash presented in the statements of cash flows to the cash presented on the balance sheet. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting (ASU 2017-09), which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. The ASU provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation . Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2018-02) , which permits entities to reclassify tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of tax reform to retained earnings. Companies that elect to reclassify these amounts must reclassify stranded tax effects for all items accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of ASU 2018-02 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2018-07), which expands the scope of ASC 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation , to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods or services from nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of ASU 2018-07 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (ASU 2018-13), which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, adding and modifying certain disclosures. ASU 2018-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of ASU 2018-13 on our disclosures. 3. Net Loss Per Share Basic and diluted net loss per share have been calculated using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The shares of common stock effectively repurchased in connection with the Forward Transactions (as defined and described in Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities) are considered participating securities requiring the two-class method to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share. Net earnings in future periods will be allocated between common shares and participating securities. In periods of a net loss, the shares associated with the Forward Transactions will not receive an allocation of losses, as the counterparties to the Forward Transactions are not required to fund losses. Additionally, the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 excludes approximately 7.2 million shares that will be repurchased as a result of the Forward Transactions. As a result of the net loss for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for the periods where such shares or securities were outstanding, all of the outstanding shares of common stock underlying stock options, deferred stock units and restricted stock units were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding because they were anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016; however, because of the undistributed losses, the shares associated with the 114 Forward Transactions are excluded from the computation of basic earnings per share as undistributed losses are not allocated to these shares ( in thousands, except per share amounts ): Net loss Less: Participation rights of the Forward Transactions Undistributed losses Weighted-average common shares outstanding-basic and diluted Net loss attributable to common stock per share-basic and diluted 4. Revenue Recognition Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of the transaction price in our contracts allocated to the remaining unsatisfied performance obligations is approximately $972 million, most of which relates to our commercial aviation contracts. Approximately $195 million represents future equipment revenue that is expected to be recognized within the next one to three years. The remaining $777 million primarily represents connectivity and entertainment service revenues which are recognized as services are provided, which is expected to occur through the remaining term of the contract (approximately 5-10 years). We have excluded from this amount: all variable consideration derived from our connectivity or entertainment services that is allocated entirely to our performance of obligations related to such services; consideration from contracts that have an original duration of one year or less; revenue from passenger services on airlines operating under the turnkey model; and revenue from contracts that have been executed but have not yet met the accounting definition of a contract since the airline has not yet determined which products in our portfolio it wishes to select, and, as a result, we are unable to determine which products and services will be transferred to the customer. Disaggregation of revenue The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by category (in thousands) : Service revenue Connectivity Entertainment, CAS and other Total service revenue Equipment revenue ATG (1) Satellite (1) Other Total equipment revenue Customer type Airline passenger and aircraft owner/operator Airline, OEM and aftermarket dealer (2) Third party Total revenue 115 ATG and satellite equipment revenue for the CA-NA segment includes the $45.4 million related to the accounting impact of the transition of one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model. Approximately $43.4 million was included in ATG equipment revenue and approximately $2.0 million was included in satellite equipment revenue. Airline, OEM and aftermarket dealer revenue includes all equipment revenue for our three segments, including the $45.4 million accounting impact of the transition of one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model. Contract balances Our current and non-current deferred revenue balances totaled $60.1 million and $61.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively. Deferred revenue includes, among other things, equipment, multi-packs, subscriptions, sponsorship activities and airline-directed connectivity and entertainment services. Our current and non-current contract asset balances totaled $59.9 million and $5.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively. Contract assets represents the aggregate amount of revenue recognized in excess of billings for our airline-directed contracts. Our STC balances were $16.5 million and $7.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018, respectively. We recognized $1.0 million of deferred STC costs as part of our engineering, design and development costs in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. As noted above, STC costs for our airline-directed contracts are capitalized and expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. Impact of adoption of ASC 606 The following table presents the post adoption impact of ASC 606 on our consolidated balance sheet and the statement of operations (in thousands) : Assets Prepaid expenses and other current assets Other non-current assets Liabilities Current deferred revenue Other non-current liabilities Equity Accumulated deficit 116 Revenue: Service revenue Equipment revenue Operating expenses: Cost of equipment revenue Engineering, design and development Net loss 5. Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts Inventories as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows ( in thousands ): Work-in-process component parts Finished goods (1) Total inventory The increase in our inventories is primarily due to the allocation of a portion of our uninstalled airborne equipment ( i.e. , shipsets forecasted for installation under an airline-directed contract) within our CA-NA and CA-ROW segments from property and equipment, net, to inventories. Historically, all uninstalled airborne equipment for the CA-NA and CA-ROW segments was classified as property and equipment, net, as the majority of our installations were performed under our turnkey model agreements. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information on the turnkey model treatment. As our uninstalled airborne equipment is increasingly being deployed under airline-directed model agreements, we now allocate our uninstalled airborne equipment between property and equipment, net, and inventories, based on our forecasts of estimated future installations by contract type. Prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows ( in thousands ): Contract assets (1) Prepaid satellite services Restricted cash Other Total prepaid expenses and other current assets Changes between December 31, 2018 and 2017 are due to the adoption of ASC 606 and additional activity during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 4, Revenue Recognition, for additional information. 117 Property and equipment as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows ( in thousands ): Office equipment, furniture, fixtures and other Leasehold improvements Airborne equipment (1) (2) Network equipment Accumulated depreciation Property and equipment, net Changes between December 31, 2018 and 2017 relate to the accounting impact of the transition of one of our airline partner agreements to the airline-directed model and the adoption of ASC 606 (see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information). Changes between December 31, 2018 and 2017 also relate to the allocation of uninstalled airborne equipment to inventory (see inventories above for additional information). Other non-current assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 consist of the following ( in thousands ): Contract assets (1) Deferred STC costs (1) Deferred cost of equipment revenue (2) Restricted cash Other Total other non-current assets Changes between December 31, 2018 and 2017 are primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 and additional activity during the year. See Note 4, Revenue Recognition, for more information. Changes between December 31, 2018 and 2017 are primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. Accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 consist of the following ( in thousands ): Employee compensation and benefits Airborne equipment and installation costs Airline-related accrued liabilities, including revenue share Accrued interest Accrued satellite network costs Warranty reserve Other Total accrued liabilities 118 Other non-current liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 consist of the following ( in thousands ): Deferred rent Deferred revenue (1) Asset retirement obligations Deferred tax liabilities Other Total other non-current liabilities Changes between December 31, 2018 and 2017 are primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for more information. Changes in our warranty reserve, which is included in accrued liabilities, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 consist of the following ( in thousands ): BalanceJanuary 1, 2017 Accruals for warranties issued Settlements of warranties BalanceDecember 31, 2017 Accruals for warranties issued Settlements of warranties BalanceDecember 31, 2018 Changes between December 31, 2018 and 2017 relate to the accounting impact of the transition of one of our airline agreements to the airline-directed model, additional activity under airline-directed models are associated with remediation of quality issues associated with our 2Ku technology. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. Changes in our non-current asset retirement obligations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 consist of the following ( in thousands ): BalanceJanuary 1, 2017 Liabilities incurred (1) Liabilities settled Accretion expense Foreign exchange rate adjustments BalanceDecember 31, 2017 Liabilities incurred (2) Liabilities settled Accretion expense Foreign exchange rate adjustments BalanceDecember 31, 2018 119 Includes $0.2 million related to a change in estimate in the expected cash flows for our estimated liabilities. Includes $0.8 million related to a change in estimate in the expected cash flows for our estimated liabilities. 6. Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are comprised of indefinite- and finite-lived intangible assets. We own the rights to both 3MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800 MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (the 3 MHz FCC License), which is used in the operation of our ATG network, and the license for 1 MHz of ATG spectrum in the nationwide 800MHz Commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone band (1 MHz FCC License) acquired in the Airfone Acquisition. Together we refer to the 3 MHz FCC License and the 1 MHz FCC License as the FCC Licenses. While the FCC Licenses were issued with 10-year terms, such licenses are subject to renewal by the FCC, and renewals of licenses held by others have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. Moreover, we have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that limit the useful life of the FCC Licenses. As a result, the FCC Licenses are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets which we do not amortize. We reevaluate the useful life of the FCC Licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Our annual impairment assessment of the FCC Licenses for 2018, 2017, and 2016 indicated no impairment. Our software relates to the development of internal use software which is used to run our network and support our service offerings. Software also includes software embedded in the equipment that we sell to our customers. Our goodwill balance, all of which related to our BA segment, was $0.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our intangible assets, other than goodwill, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows ( in thousands, except for weighted average remaining useful life ): Amortized intangible assets: Software Service customer relationships Other intangible assets OEM and dealer relationships Total amortized intangible assets Unamortized intangible assets: FCC Licenses Total intangible assets Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $26.5 million, $24.9 million and $21.6 million, respectively. 120 Amortization expense for each of the next five years and thereafter is estimated to be as follows ( in thousands ): Years ending December 31, 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Actual future amortization expense could differ from the estimated amount as the result of future investments and other factors. 7. Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities Long-term debt as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was as follows ( in thousands ): Senior Secured Notes 2022 Convertible Notes 2020 Convertible Notes Total debt Less deferred financing costs Total long-term debt Senior Secured Notes On June 14, 2016 (the Issue Date), Gogo Intermediate Holdings LLC (GIH) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Gogo Inc.) and Gogo Finance Co. Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GIH) (the Co-Issuer and, together with GIH, the Issuers), issued $525 million aggregate principal amount of 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the Original Senior Secured Notes) under an Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2016 (the Original Indenture), among the Issuers, us, as guarantor, certain subsidiaries of GIH, as guarantors (the Subsidiary Guarantors and, together with us, the Guarantors), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the Trustee) and as collateral agent (in such capacity, the Collateral Agent). On January 3, 2017, the Issuers issued $65 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the January 2017 Additional Notes). The January 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 108% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $70.2 million. On September 20, 2017, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the first supplemental indenture (the Supplemental Indenture and, together with the Original Indenture, the Indenture) to modify certain covenants, as discussed below. On September 25, 2017, the Issuers issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of additional 12.500% senior secured notes due 2022 (the September 2017 Additional Notes). The September 2017 Additional Notes were issued at a price equal to 113% of their face value resulting in gross proceeds of $113.0 million. Additionally, we received approximately $2.9 million for interest that accrued from July 1, 2017 through September 24, 2017, which was paid when we paid in full our January 2018 interest payment in January 2018. We refer to the Original Senior Secured Notes, the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes collectively as the Senior Secured Notes. As noted above, on September 20, 2017, the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Trustee entered into the Supplemental Indenture to (i) increase the amount of additional secured indebtedness under the Credit Facilities 121 (as defined in the Indenture) that may be incurred by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) under the Indenture by $100 million (from $75 million to $175 million in aggregate principal amount), (ii) permit the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional secured indebtedness in connection with vendor financing arrangements not to exceed $50 million in aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding and (iii) permit the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to make additional dividends or distributions to Gogo in an aggregate amount of up to $15 million during any twelve-month period to pay interest on any indebtedness or preferred stock with a maturity later than July 1, 2022. The Supplemental Indenture became effective immediately upon execution, following our receipt of consents from holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Notes (excluding Existing Notes held by the Issuers or any affiliates of the Issuers) to the Supplemental Indenture and amendments to the collateral agency agreement governing the Senior Secured Notes (the Consent Solicitation). In connection with the Consent Solicitation, GIH paid $1.4 million in fees (Consent Fees) to holders of Existing Notes who validly tendered (and did not revoke) their consents prior to the expiration of the Consent Solicitation. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes was $690.0 million and $690.0 million, respectively, the unamortized debt premium and Consent Fees were $12.7 million and $15.5 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount was $702.7 million and $705.5 million, respectively. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes accrues at the rate of 12.500% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, which commenced on January 1, 2017 (other than the January 2017 Additional Notes, for which interest payments commenced on July 1, 2017, and the September 2017 Additional Notes, for which interest payments commenced on January 1, 2018). The Senior Secured Notes mature on July 1, 2022. The January 2017 Additional Notes and September 2017 Additional Notes have the same terms as the Original Senior Secured Notes, except with respect to the issue date and issue price, and are treated as a single series for all purposes under the Indenture and the security documents that govern the Senior Secured Notes. We paid approximately $11.4 million, $2.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of aggregate origination fees and financing costs related to the issuance of the Original Senior Secured Notes, the January 2017 Additional Notes and the September 2017 Additional Notes, which have been accounted for as deferred financing costs. Additionally, as noted above, we paid approximately $1.4 million of Consent Fees, which partially offset the net carrying value of the Senior Secured Notes. The deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet are being amortized over the contractual term of the Senior Secured Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense was $2.6 million, $2.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the Senior Secured Notes was $10.0 million and $12.6 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The Senior Secured Notes are the senior secured indebtedness of the Issuers and are: effectively senior to all of the Issuers existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and the Issuers indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, if any, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes; effectively senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes; effectively equal in right of payment with the Issuers existing and future (i) unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, if any, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes; 122 structurally senior to all of our existing and future indebtedness, including our Convertible Notes (as defined below); and structurally subordinated to all of the indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-Guarantors (other than the Issuers). The Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed, on a senior secured basis, by us and all of GIHs existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than the Co-Issuer), subject to certain exceptions. The Issuers obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are not guaranteed by Gogo International Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of ours that holds no material assets other than equity interests in our foreign subsidiaries. Each guarantee is a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor and is: effectively senior to all of such Guarantors existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and such Guarantors indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral, if any, securing the guarantee of such Guarantor, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such guarantee; effectively senior in right of payment to all of such Guarantors future indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantors guarantee; effectively equal in right of payment with all of such Guarantors existing and future (i) unsecured indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantors guarantee, and (ii) indebtedness secured on a junior priority basis by the same collateral, if any, securing the guarantee of such Guarantor, in each case to the extent of any insufficiency in the collateral securing such guarantee; and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any non-Guarantor subsidiary of such Guarantor (excluding, in the case of our guarantee, the Issuers). The Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on substantially all of the Issuers and the Guarantors assets, except for certain excluded assets, including pledged equity interests of the Issuers and all of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes. The security interests in certain collateral may be released without the consent of holders of the Senior Secured Notes if such collateral is disposed of in a transaction that complies with the Indenture and related security agreements. In addition, under certain circumstances, we and the Guarantors have the right to transfer certain intellectual property assets that on the Issue Date constitute collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes or the guarantees to a restricted subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland, resulting in the release of such collateral without consent of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. On or after July 1, 2019, the Issuers may, at their option, at any time or from time to time, redeem any of the Senior Secured Notes in whole or in part. The Senior Secured Notes will be redeemable at the following redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant regular record date on or prior to the redemption date to receive interest due on an interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period commencing on July 1 of the following years: 2019 2020 2021 and thereafter In addition, at any time prior to July 1, 2019, the Issuers may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 123 112.500% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of redemption; provided, however , that Senior Secured Notes representing at least 65% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption. The Issuers may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to July 1, 2019, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus the make-whole premium set forth in the Indenture as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption date. The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers and the Subsidiary Guarantors and, in certain circumstances, our ability, to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make investments; create restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuers or make other intercompany transfers; create liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain transactions with the Issuers affiliates, including us. Most of these covenants will cease to apply if, and for as long as, the Senior Secured Notes have investment grade ratings from both Moodys Investment Services, Inc. and Standard & Poors. If we or the Issuers undergo specific types of change of control prior to July 1, 2022, GIH is required to make an offer to repurchase for cash all of the Senior Secured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the payment date. The Indenture provides for events of default, which, if any of them occur, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, and interest on all of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes issued under the Indenture to be due and payable immediately. As of December 31, 2018, no event of default had occurred. Convertible Notes 2022 Convertible Notes On November 21, 2018, we issued $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the 2022 Convertible Notes) in private offerings to qualified institutional buyers, including pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and in concurrent private placements. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $32.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $22.8 million was subsequently exercised during December 2018, resulting in a total issuance of $237.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes. The 2022 Convertible Notes mature on May 15, 2022, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances described below. Upon maturity, we have the option to settle our obligation through cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We pay interest on the 2022 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. Interest payments begin on May 15, 2019. The $237.8 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $188.7 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $49.1 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, we must settle the 2022 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2022 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2022 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2022 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 13.6%. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. 124 As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding principal on the 2022 Convertible Notes was $237.8 million, the unamortized debt discount was $47.7 million and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $190.1 million. We incurred approximately $8.1 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2022 Convertible Notes, of which $6.4 million and $1.7 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2022 Convertible Notes. The $6.4 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2022 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2022 Convertible Notes was $6.2 million and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2022 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 166.6667 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2022 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.00 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we currently expect to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes then outstanding. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, we currently expect to deliver shares of our common stock. We may elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Holders may convert the 2022 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time prior to January 15, 2022, but only in the following circumstances: during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day; during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2022 Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2022 Convertible Notes on each such trading day; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of the above events allowing for conversion prior to January 15, 2022 occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2022 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after January 15, 2022 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding May 15, 2022. In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2022 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2022 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following a make-whole fundamental change, we will increase the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. 2020 Convertible Notes On March 3, 2015, we issued $340.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the 2020 Convertible Notes) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to Rule 125 144A under the Securities Act. We granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments, of which $21.9 million was subsequently exercised during March 2015, resulting in a total issuance of $361.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes. The 2020 Convertible Notes mature on March 1, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances described below. Upon maturity, we have the option to settle our obligation through cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. We pay interest on the 2020 Convertible Notes semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year. Interest payments began on September 1, 2015. During November 2018, we repurchased $199.9 million of outstanding principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes. As a result of the repurchase, the carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes were accreted up $17.9 million to face value. Additionally, we expensed $1.3 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and paid $0.5 million of fees in connection with the repurchase. These three items comprise the loss on extinguishment of debt of $19.7 million in our consolidated statement of operations. The $361.9 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes was initially allocated between long-term debt (the liability component) at $261.9 million and additional paid-in capital (the equity component) at $100.0 million, within the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of the liability component was measured using rates determined for similar debt instruments without a conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component, representing the conversion option, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the aggregate face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes. If we or the note holders elect not to settle the debt through conversion, we must settle the 2020 Convertible Notes at face value. Therefore, the liability component will be accreted up to the face value of the 2020 Convertible Notes, which will result in additional non-cash interest expense being recognized in the consolidated statements of operations through the 2020 Convertible Notes maturity date (see Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information). The effective interest rate on the 2020 Convertible Notes, including accretion of the notes to par and debt issuance cost amortization, was approximately 11.5%. The equity component will not be remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding principal on the 2020 Convertible Notes was $162.0 million and $361.9 million, respectively, the unamortized debt discount was $12.8 million and $50.4 million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability component was $149.2 million and $311.5 million, respectively. We incurred approximately $10.4 million of issuance costs related to the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, of which $7.5 million and $2.9 million were recorded to deferred financing costs and additional paid-in capital, respectively, in proportion to the allocation of the proceeds of the 2020 Convertible Notes. The $7.5 million recorded as deferred financing costs on our consolidated balance sheet is being amortized over the term of the 2020 Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Additionally, as noted above, we expensed $1.3 million of unamortized deferred financing fees as a result of the repurchase. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2020 Convertible Notes was $0.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively, and is included as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8, Interest Costs, for additional information. The 2020 Convertible Notes had an initial conversion rate of 41.9274 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2020 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $23.85 per share of our common stock. Upon conversion, we currently expect to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes then outstanding. With respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount, we currently expect to deliver shares of our common stock. We may elect to deliver cash in lieu of all or 126 a portion of such shares. The shares of common stock subject to conversion are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations under the if-converted method as their impact is anti-dilutive. Holders may convert the 2020 Convertible Notes, at their option, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at any time prior to December 1, 2019, but only in the following circumstances: during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2020 Convertible Notes on each applicable trading day; during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2020 Convertible Notes is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2020 Convertible Notes on each such trading day; or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of the above events allowing for conversion prior to December 1, 2019 occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018. Regardless of whether any of the foregoing circumstances occurs, a holder may convert its 2020 Convertible Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at any time on or after December 1, 2019 until maturity. In addition, if we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2020 Convertible Notes), holders may, subject to certain conditions, require us to repurchase their 2020 Convertible Notes for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2020 Convertible Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2020 Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. Forward Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 2020 Convertible Notes, we paid approximately $140 million to enter into prepaid forward stock repurchase transactions (the Forward Transactions) with certain financial institutions (the Forward Counterparties), pursuant to which we purchased approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock for settlement on or around the March 1, 2020 maturity date for the 2020 Convertible Notes, subject to the ability of each Forward Counterparty to elect to settle all or a portion of its Forward Transactions early. In the future, we may request that any Forward Counterparty modify the settlement terms of its Forward Transaction to provide that, in lieu of the delivery of the applicable number of shares of our common stock to us to settle a portion of its Forward Transaction in accordance with its terms, such Forward Counterparty would pay to us the net proceeds from the sale by such Forward Counterparty (or its affiliate) of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock in a registered offering (which may include block sales, sales on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, sales in the over-the-counter market, sales pursuant to negotiated transactions or otherwise, at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices). Any such sales could potentially decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our common stock. The Forward Counterparties are not required to effect any such settlement in cash in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock and, if we request for any Forward Counterparty to effect any such settlement, it will be entered into in the discretion of the applicable Forward Counterparty on such terms as we may agree with such Forward Counterparty at the time. As a result of the Forward Transactions, total shareholders equity within our consolidated balance sheet was reduced by approximately $140 million. Approximately 7.2 million shares of common stock that will be effectively repurchased through the Forward Transactions are treated as retired shares for basic and diluted EPS purposes although they remain legally outstanding. 127 Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility On July 30, 2014, GIH, Gogo Business Aviation LLC, f/k/a Aircell Business Aviation Services LLC (GBA), and Gogo LLC, as borrowers (collectively, the Borrowers), entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement (the Amendment) to the Credit Agreement dated as of June 21, 2012 and amended on April 4, 2013 (the Amended Senior Term Facility) among the Borrowers, the lenders named therein, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. We refer to the Amendment and the Amended Senior Term Facility collectively as the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility. On June 14, 2016, the outstanding principal balance of $287.7 million, together with accrued and unpaid interest, was paid in full, and the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility was terminated in accordance with its terms on such date (subject to the survival of provisions expressly stated therein to survive the termination thereof). Additionally, we paid the voluntary prepayment premium of 3.0%, or $8.6 million, and wrote off all of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs of $6.8 million. Both of these items are included in loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated financial statements. We paid $22.2 million of loan origination fees and financing costs related to the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility, all but $4.1 million of which were accounted for as deferred financing costs. Total amortization expense of the deferred financing costs was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Amortization expense is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, deferred financing costs related to the Amended and Restated Senior Term Facility were written off as of June 14, 2016. Restricted Cash Our restricted cash balances were $7.0 million and $7.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and primarily consist of letters of credit. Certain of the letters of credit require us to maintain restricted cash accounts in a similar amount, and are issued for the benefit of the landlords at our current office locations in Chicago, IL, Bensenville, IL and Broomfield, CO. 8. Interest Costs The following is a summary of our interest costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands) : Interest costs charged to expense Amortization of deferred financing costs Accretion of Convertible Notes Amortization of debt premium of Senior Secured Notes Interest expense Interest costs capitalized to property and equipment Interest costs capitalized to software Total interest costs We capitalize a portion of our interest on funds borrowed during the active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and amortized over the useful lives of the assets. 128 9. Common Stock and Preferred Stock Common Stock We have one class of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our common stock is junior to our preferred stock, if and when issued. Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes a total of 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes 100,000,000 shares of new preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. No shares of this new preferred stock have been issued. The preferred stock may be issued, from time to time, in one or more series as authorized by the Board of Directors, which has the authority to designate the terms of any series of preferred stock issued, including, without limitation, the number of shares to be included in such series of preferred stock, any dividend, redemption, conversion rights or voting powers and the designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights. 10. Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2 defined as observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. Long-Term Debt: Our financial assets and liabilities that are disclosed but not measured at fair value include the Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes, which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet at cost. The fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since they are based on quoted market prices of our instruments in markets that are not active. We estimated the fair value of the Senior Secured Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume these obligations. The upfront cash payments used in the calculations of fair value on our December 31, 2018 consolidated balance sheet, excluding any issuance costs, is the amount that a market participant would be able to lend at December 31, 2018 to an entity with a credit rating similar to ours and achieve sufficient cash inflows to cover the scheduled cash outflows under the Senior Secured Notes, the 2022 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes. The calculated fair value of our 2022 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes is correlated to our stock price and as a result, significant changes to our stock price could have a significant impact on their calculated fair values. The fair value and carrying value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in thousands) : Senior Secured Notes 2022 Convertible Notes 2020 Convertible Notes 129 Fair value amounts are rounded to the nearest million. Carrying value of the Senior Secured Notes includes unamortized debt premium and Consent Fees of $12.7 million and $15.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. Carrying value of the 2022 Convertible Notes excludes unamortized debt discount of $47.7 million as of December 31, 2018. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. Carrying value of the 2020 Convertible Notes excludes unamortized debt discount of $12.8 million and $50.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Other Liabilities, for further information. We have held-to-maturity financial instruments where carrying value approximated fair value. There were no fair value adjustments to these financial instruments during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 11. Business Segments and Major Customers We operate our business through three operating segments: Commercial Aviation North America, or CA-NA, Commercial Aviation Rest of World, or CA-ROW and Business Aviation, or BA. CA-NA Segment: Our CA-NA segment provides in-flight connectivity and wireless digital entertainment solutions to commercial airline passengers flying routes that generally begin and end within North America, which for this purpose includes the United States, Canada and Mexico. CA-ROW Segment: Our CA-ROW business provides in-flight connectivity and wireless digital entertainment solutions to passengers flying on foreign-based commercial airlines and flights outside of North America for North American-based commercial airlines. The routes included in our CA-ROW segment are those that begin and/or end outside of North America (as defined above) for which our international service is provided. BA Segment : Our BA business provides equipment for in-flight connectivity along with voice and data services to the business aviation market. BA services include Gogo Biz, our in-flight broadband service that utilizes both our ATG network and our ATG spectrum, Passenger Entertainment, our in-flight entertainment service, and satellite-based voice and data services through strategic alliances with satellite companies. Customers include business aircraft manufacturers, owners, and operators, as well as government and military entities. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany transactions between segments are excluded as they are not included in managements performance review of the segments. Our foreign revenue accounted for less than 15% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 and less than 10% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We do not segregate assets between segments for internal reporting. Therefore, asset-related information has not been presented. We do not disclose assets outside of the United States as they totaled less than 15% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2018 and less than 10% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2017. For our airborne assets, we consider only those assets installed in aircraft associated with international commercial airline partners to be owned outside of the United States. Management evaluates performance and allocates resources to each segment based on segment profit (loss), which is calculated internally as net income (loss) attributable to common stock before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain non-cash items (including amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives, stock-based compensation expense, adjustment to deferred financing costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of STC costs and the accounting impact of the transition to the 130 airline-directed model). Segment profit (loss) is a measure of performance reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and evaluating segment performance. In addition, segment profit (loss) is included herein in conformity with ASC 280-10, Segment Reporting . Management believes that segment profit (loss) provides useful information for analyzing and evaluating the underlying operating results of each segment. However, segment profit (loss) should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to common stock or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, our computation of segment profit (loss) may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies. Information regarding our reportable segments is as follows ( in thousands ): Service revenue Equipment revenue (1) Total revenue Segment profit (loss) Service revenue Equipment revenue Total revenue Segment profit (loss) Service revenue Equipment revenue Total revenue Segment profit (loss) CA-NA equipment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the accounting impact of the transition of one of our airline partners to the airline-directed model. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. 131 A reconciliation of segment profit (loss) to the relevant consolidated amounts is as follows ( in thousands ): CA-NA segment profit CA-ROW segment loss BA segment profit Total segment profit Interest income Interest expense Depreciation and amortization Transition to airline-directed model Amortization of deferred airborne lease incentives (1) Amortization of STC costs Stock compensation expense Loss on extinguishment of debt Adjustment of deferred financing fees Other income (expense) Loss before income taxes Amortization of deferred airborne lease incentive only relates to our CA-NA and CA-ROW segments. See Note 15, Leases, for further information. Major Customers and Airline Partnerships Under the turnkey model, we refer to the airline as a partner, and under the airline-directed model, we refer to the airline as a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2018, American Airlines accounted for approximately 22% of consolidated revenue, while no other customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue during the prior year periods. Revenue earned from American Airlines for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $45.4 million of equipment revenue recognized due to the airlines transition to the airline-directed model in January 2018. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. Revenue earned from passengers on aircraft operated by American Airlines, which was under the turnkey model during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, accounted for approximately 21% and 23% of consolidated revenue, respectively. Revenue earned from passengers on aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines, which is under the turnkey model, accounted for approximately 23%, 26% and 27% of consolidated revenue, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. American Airlines accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018 and one customer accounted for approximately 15% of consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2017. Delta Air Lines, one of our airline partners, accounted for approximately 11% and 21%, respectively, of consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. 12. Stock-Based Compensation As of December 31, 2018, we maintained three stock-based employee compensation plans: the Gogo Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2016 Omnibus Plan), the Gogo Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2013 Omnibus Plan), and The Aircell Holdings Inc. Stock Option Plan (the 2010 Plan), collectively referred 132 to as the Stock Plans. Our Stock Plans provide for the grant of both equity and cash awards, including non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance awards (shares and units), restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), deferred share units (DSUs) and other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents to eligible employees, directors and consultants, as determined by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the Stock Plans, 27,906,570 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. As of December 31, 2018, 7,841,256 shares remained available for grant under our Stock Plans. The contractual life of granted options is 10 years. All options that are unvested as of the date on which a recipients employment terminates, as well as vested options that are not exercised within a prescribed period following termination, are forfeited and become available for future grants. Options granted to date include options that (a) vest 20% upon grant with the remainder vesting in equal annual increments over a four-year period, (b) vest over a four-year period with 25% vesting on the anniversary of each grant date, (c) vest 25% after one year from grant date and in equal monthly increments for the following three years or (d) vest on the date of grant for options granted to non-employee members of our board of directors. Beginning in 2013, we granted RSUs that vest in equal annual increments over a four-year period. Vested RSUs will be settled, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, in shares of our common stock or in cash equal to the value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock on the vesting date. We also granted directors DSUs that were vested at grant. DSUs will be settled in shares of our common stock 90 days after the director ceases to serve as a director. Beginning in 2014, we granted restricted stock, which vests in equal annual increments over a four-year period. These shares are deemed issued as of the date of grant, but not outstanding until they vest. We intend to settle RSU, DSU and restricted stock awards in stock and we have the shares available to do so. In June 2016, the Compensation Committee approved grants of both non-market based awards and market based awards. The contractual term and time-based vesting provisions for the non-market based awards are consistent with prior grants as noted above. The market based awards vest based on achieving one or more predetermined market conditions and completion of the same time-based vesting requirements applicable to the non-market based awards. The following is a summary of our stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations for the years December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands) : Cost of service revenue Cost of equipment revenue Engineering, design and development Sales and marketing General and administrative Total stock-based compensation expense 133 A summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 is as follows: Options outstandingJanuary 1, 2018 Granted Exercised Forfeited Expired Options outstandingDecember 31, 2018 Options exercisableDecember 31, 2018 As of December 31, 2018, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options were approximately $12 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.4 years. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was approximately $9 million, $10 million and $9 million, respectively. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Weighted average assumptions used and weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were as follows: Approximate risk-free interest rate Average expected life (years) Dividend yield Volatility Weighted average grant date fair value of common stock underlying options granted Weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the term that mirrored the expected term in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of our stock options was determined based upon a simplified assumption that the stock options will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life. The dividend yield was based on expected dividends at the time of grant. We have not been a public company long enough to calculate volatility based exclusively on our own common stock. Therefore, the expected volatility is calculated as of each grant date based on a weighting of our own common stock and reported data for a peer group of publicly traded companies for which historical information is available. The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs and DSUs for the year ended December 31, 2018: UnvestedJanuary 1, 2018 Granted Vested Forfeited/canceled UnvestedDecember 31, 2018 134 As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $15 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years. The total grant date fair value of RSUs and DSUs vested in 2018 was approximately $8 million. The following table summarizes the activity for our restricted stock for the year ended December 31, 2018: UnvestedJanuary 1, 2018 Granted Vested Forfeited/canceled UnvestedDecember 31, 2018 As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee restricted stock. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.9 years. ESPP - In June 2013, the Board of Directors and stockholders approved the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which became effective on June 26, 2013 and during 2017, increased the number of shares reserved under the ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of common stock during pre-specified offering periods at a discount established by the Compensation Committee not to exceed 15% of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of the offering period (whichever is lower). Under the ESPP, 1,200,000 shares were reserved for issuance and 320,905 shares of common stock were issued during the year ended December 31, 2018. 13. Employee Retirement and Postretirement Benefits 401(k) Plan - Under our 401(k) plan, all employees who are eligible to participate are entitled to make tax-deferred contributions, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. We match 100% of the employees first 4% of contributions made, subject to annual limitations. Our matching contributions were $5.1 million, $5.9 million, and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 14. Income Tax For financial reporting purposes, loss before income taxes included the following components for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 ( in thousands ): United States Foreign Loss before income taxes 135 Significant components of the (benefit) provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows ( in thousands ): Current: Federal State Foreign Deferred: Federal State Total The benefit (provision) for income taxes differs from income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 as a result of the following items: Federal statutory rate Effect of: Impact of change in tax rate Change in valuation allowance State income taxes-net of federal tax benefit Other Effective tax rate 136 Components of the net deferred income tax asset as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows ( in thousands ): Deferred income tax assets: Compensation accruals Stock options Inventory Warranty reserves Deferred rent Deferred revenue Federal net operating loss (NOL) State NOL Interest carryforward UNICAP adjustment Finite-lived intangible assets Other Total deferred income tax assets Deferred income tax liabilities: Fixed assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets Convertible Notes discount Other Total deferred income tax liabilities Total deferred income tax Valuation allowance Net deferred income tax liability We assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized through the generation of future taxable income. We generated net losses in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, which means we are in a domestic three-year cumulative loss position. As a result of this and other assessments in fiscal year 2018, we concluded that a full valuation allowance is required for all deferred tax assets and liabilities except for deferred tax liabilities associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets. As of December 31, 2018, the federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforward amount was approximately $574 million and the state NOL carryforward amount was approximately $419 million. The federal NOLs begin to expire in 2031. The state NOLs expire in various tax years and began to expire in 2016. Utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three-year period. We are subject to taxation in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia, China, France, Germany, the Netherlands and India. With few exceptions, as of December 31, 2018, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015. 137 As a result of the passage of H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform) in December 2017, the tax effected amounts of the deferred tax assets and liabilities decreased. A large portion of this change in the deferred tax balances resulted in an offsetting change to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and did not affect tax expense. For the deferred tax liabilities that are not offset by changes to the valuation allowance, our net deferred tax liability was reduced by approximately $3 million. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits. We record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision line item in the consolidated statement of operations. No penalties or interest related to uncertain tax positions were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not have a liability recorded for interest or potential penalties. We do not expect there will be a change in the unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. 15. Leases Arrangements with Commercial Airlines  Pursuant to contractual agreements with our airline partners, we place our equipment on commercial aircraft operated by the airlines for the purpose of delivering our service to passengers on the aircraft. There are currently two types of commercial airline arrangements: turnkey and airline-directed. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information on airline-directed arrangements. We recognized $31.7 million, $41.8 million, and $29.5 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as a reduction to our cost of service revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018, deferred airborne lease incentives of $24.1 million and $129.1 million, respectively, are included in current and non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2017, deferred airborne lease incentives of $42.1 million and $142.9 million, respectively, are included in current and non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The decrease in our deferred airborne lease incentives and the amortization of the deferred airborne lease incentives relate to the accounting impact of the transition of one of our airline agreements to the airline-directed model. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. Under the turnkey model, the revenue share paid to our airline partners represents operating lease payments. They are deemed to be contingent rental payments, as the payments due to each airline are based on a percentage of our CA-NA and CA-ROW service revenue generated from that airlines passengers, which is unknown until realized. Therefore, we cannot estimate the lease payments due to an airline at the commencement of our contract with such airline. This rental expense is included in cost of service revenue and is partially offset by the amortization of the deferred airborne lease incentives discussed above. Such rental expenses totaled a net charge of $24.5 million, $30.5 million, and $41.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in rental expense was due to the transition of one of our airline agreements to the airline-directed model. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information. Leases and Cell Site Contracts  We have lease agreements relating to certain facilities and equipment, which are considered operating leases. Rent expense for such operating leases was $12.6 million, $12.0 million and $11.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Additionally, we have operating leases with wireless service providers for tower space and base station capacity on a volume usage basis (cell site leases), some of which provide for minimum annual payments. Our cell site leases generally provide for an initial noncancelable term with various renewal options. Total cell site rental expense was $10.5 million, $9.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 138 Annual future minimum obligations for operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter, other than the arrangements we have with our commercial airline partners, as of December 31, 2018, are as follows ( in thousands ): 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Equipment Leases  We lease certain computer and network equipment under capital leases, for which interest has been imputed with annual interest rates ranging from approximately 8% to 14%. As of December 31, 2018, the computer equipment leases were classified as part of office equipment, furniture, and fixtures and other in our consolidated balance sheet at a gross cost of $6.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, the network equipment leases were classified as part of network equipment in our consolidated balance sheet at a gross cost of $7.5 million. Annual future minimum obligations under capital leases for each of the next five years and thereafter, as of December 31, 2018, are as follows ( in thousands ): 2019 2020 Thereafter Total minimum lease payments Less: Amount representing interest Present value of net minimum lease payments The $0.9 million present value of net minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2018 has a current portion of $0.7 million included in current portion of long-term debt and capital leases and a non-current portion of $0.2 million included in other non-current liabilities. 16. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Commitments - We have agreements with vendors to provide us with transponder and teleport satellite services. These agreements vary in length and amount and as of December 31, 2018 commit us to purchase transponder and teleport satellite services totaling approximately $98.9 million in 2019, $89.4 million in 2020, $76.9 million in 2021, $66.1 million in 2022, $58.6 million in 2023 and $159.0 million thereafter. We have agreements with various vendors under which we have remaining commitments to purchase satellite-based systems, certifications and development services. Such commitments will become payable as we receive the equipment or certifications, or as development services are provided. A contract with one of our airline customers required us to provide the airline customer with a cash rebate of $1.8 million in June 2018, which has not yet been paid. Damages and Penalties We have entered into a number of agreements with our airline partners that require us to provide a credit or pay liquidated damages to our airline partners on a per aircraft, per day or per 139 hour basis if we are delayed in delivering our equipment, unable to install our equipment on aircraft by specified timelines or fail to comply with service level commitments. The maximum amount of future credits or payments we could be required to make under these agreements is uncertain because the amount of future credits or payments is based on certain variable inputs. Indemnifications and Guarantees - In accordance with Delaware law, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is uncertain and may be unlimited, depending upon circumstances. However, our Directors and Officers insurance does provide coverage for certain of these losses. In the ordinary course of business we may occasionally enter into agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay for the failure of the performance of others, such as the use of corporate credit cards issued to employees. Based on historical experience, we believe that the risk of sustaining any material loss related to such guarantees is remote. We have entered into a number of agreements, including our agreements with commercial airlines, pursuant to which we indemnify the other party for losses and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with any patent, copyright, or trademark infringement or misappropriation claim asserted by a third party with respect to our equipment or services. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is uncertain and is typically not limited by the terms of the agreements. Linksmart Litigation On April 20, 2018, Linksmart Wireless Technology, LLC filed suit against us and eight of our airline partners in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California alleging that our redirection server and login portal infringe a patent owned by the plaintiff. We are required under our contracts with these airlines to indemnify them for defense costs and any liabilities resulting from the suit. The Court has stayed the suits against our airline customers pending resolution of the suit against Gogo. Linksmart has also filed suit against other defendants asserting the same patent. One of these defendants has filed an inter parties review against the asserted patent and must meet a certain threshold to continue. Linksmart sought to stay the suit against Gogo until the earlier of (i) a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office that the threshold for review has not been met and that the review may not continue or (ii) if the review continues, its resolution. We agreed and the court has granted our request to stay our case until the first to occur of such events. Cases against the other defendants have also been stayed pending the inter parties review. The outcome of the inter parties review and this matter overall is inherently uncertain. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. Securities Litigation On December 10, 2018, two purported stockholders of the Company filed an amended putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division styled Pierrelouis v. Gogo Inc., naming the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation as defendants purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our securities from February 27, 2017 through May 4, 2018. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, alleging misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to our 2Ku antennas reliability and installation and remediation costs. The plaintiffs seek to recover from us and the individual defendants an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2019, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. In accordance with Delaware law, we will indemnify the individual named defendants for their defense costs and any damages they incur in connection with the suit. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors and Officers insurance policy with respect to this suit. No amounts have been accrued for any potential losses under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential losses. 140 Derivative Litigation - On September 25, 2018 and September 26, 2018, two purported stockholders of the Company filed substantively identical derivative lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, styled Nanduri v. Gogo Inc. and Hutsenpiller v. Gogo Inc., respectively. Both lawsuits were purportedly brought derivatively on behalf of us and name us as a nominal defendant and name as defendants each member of the Companys Board of Directors, its former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and its current Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President, Commercial Aviation. The complaints assert claims under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets, and allege misrepresentations or omissions by us purporting to relate to our 2Ku antennas reliability and installation and remediation costs, as well as allegedly excessive bonuses, stock options, and other compensation paid to current Officers and Directors and excessive severance paid to former Officers. The two lawsuits were consolidated and are stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the Securities Litigation. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on our behalf, an unspecified amount of damages from the individual defendants. We have filed a claim with the issuer of our Directors and Officers insurance policy with respect to these suits. No amounts have been accrued for any potential costs under this matter, as we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the litigation or any potential costs. 17.

Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2018 that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018. (b) Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Gogo Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a  15(f) and 15d  15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Gogos internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The management of Gogo, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have assessed the effectiveness of Gogos internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, the Companys management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, which report is included on Page 145 of this Form 10-K under the caption entitled Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no material changes to our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Other Information None. 144 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Gogo Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Gogo Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph related to the Companys adoption of FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , effective January 1, 2018. Basis for Opinion The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Chicago, Illinois February 21, 2019 145 Part III Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

General We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Consumers We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, Blink, and eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes fast, free shipping on millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, and other benefits. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.” Sellers We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs. Developers and Enterprises We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. Content Creators We offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. Advertisers We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. 3 Table of Contents Competition Our businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Human Capital Our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 1,541,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business. As we strive to be Earth’s best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). Over 100,000 Amazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees to promote equity for all candidates and employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at Amazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback. 4 Table of Contents Available Information Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Risk Factors Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview,” and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse effect on us. Business and Industry Risks We Face Intense Competition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of 6 Table of Contents reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation. Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • local economic and political conditions; • government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership; • restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; • business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices; • limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; • limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; • shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; • laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; • lower levels of use of the Internet; • lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; • lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; • difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; • different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; • compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; • laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and • geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth. The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will 7 Table of Contents ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary fears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third 8 Table of Contents parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service. We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa. Operating Risks Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following: • our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands; • our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; • our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; • the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; • changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; • timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; • the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; • the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth; 9 Table of Contents • the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; • variations in the mix of products and services we sell; • variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; • the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; • factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics); • the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; • increases in the prices of transportation (including fuel), energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products, including as a result of inflationary pressures; • constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs; • the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; • our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; • the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings; • the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and • disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade disputes (including restrictive governmental actions impacting us and our third-party sellers in China or other foreign countries), and similar events. We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition, failure to optimize inventory or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network currently is being affected by regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events. 10 Table of Contents We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches Because we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented. We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results. Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. We also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce. We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation. Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, 11 Table of Contents components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises), or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • impairment of other relationships; • variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and • difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions involve risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • problems retaining key personnel; • additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; • the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions; • the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations; • the difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing conditions, and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; • the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; • the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented; • losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our financial results; 12 Table of Contents • for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, or investments for which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes; • the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company; • the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face; • potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and • for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results. We Face Significant Inventory Risk In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results. We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer 13 Table of Contents protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services. We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as: • changes in interest rates; • conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in; • quarterly variations in operating results; • fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular; • changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels; • changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; • changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; • changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and • transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both. Legal and Regulatory Risks Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations violate competition rules, including aspects of Amazon’s U.S. and European marketplace for sellers, particularly with respect to use of data, fulfillment services, and featured offers, and legislative and regulatory initiatives in Europe and elsewhere allow authorities to restrict or prohibit certain operations or actions pre-emptively without the need to assess specific competitive effects. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks. 14 Table of Contents Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state attorneys general. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations. We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for certain product liability claims up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date. Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their 15 Table of Contents valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities. We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. For example, in February 2023, the Indian Tax Authority determined that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to the U.S. We are contesting this determination; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. We seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due. Because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix 19 Table of Contents of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.5 billion and 10.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product 20 Table of Contents vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $390 million. In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 46,327 $ 46,752 Investing activities (58,154) (37,601) Financing activities 6,291 9,718 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $96.0 billion and $70.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $22.7 billion and $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $46.3 billion and $46.8 billion in 2021 and 2022. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow in 2022, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, partially offset by changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 21 Table of Contents Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(58.2) billion and $(37.6) billion in 2021 and 2022, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $55.4 billion, and $58.3 billion in 2021 and 2022, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect to continue these investments over time, with increased spending on technology infrastructure. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.0 billion and $8.3 billion in 2021 and 2022. We funded the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand. We expect to fund the acquisitions of 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) and iRobot Corporation with cash on hand. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $6.3 billion and $9.7 billion in 2021 and 2022. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $27.0 billion and $62.7 billion in 2021 and 2022. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock, payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $20.7 billion and $53.0 billion in 2021 and 2022. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $7.1 billion and $675 million in 2021 and 2022. We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities, $6.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs, and $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $4.7 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included a partial election for 2020 and 2021, and a full election for 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $3.7 billion and $6.0 billion for 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $260 million and $365 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to rising interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Overview Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market volatility, the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. These factors contributed to increases in our operating costs during 2022, particularly across our North America and International segments, primarily due to a return to more normal, seasonal demand volumes in relation to our fulfillment network fixed costs, increased transportation and utility costs, and increased wage rates. In addition, rising fuel, utility, and food costs, rising interest rates, and recessionary fears may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also expect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates. We expect some or all of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q1 2023. Net Sales Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Net Sales: North America $ 279,833 $ 315,880 International 127,787 118,007 AWS 62,202 80,096 Consolidated $ 469,822 $ 513,983 Year-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline): North America 18 % 13 % International 22 (8) AWS 37 29 Consolidated 22 9 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America 18 % 13 % International 20 4 AWS 37 29 Consolidated 21 13 Net sales mix: North America 60 % 61 % International 27 23 AWS 13 16 Consolidated 100 % 100 % Sales increased 9% in 2022, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced net sales by $15.5 billion in 2022. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below. North America sales increased 13% in 2022, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. 23 Table of Contents International sales decreased 8% in 2022, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced International net sales by $15.0 billion in 2022. AWS sales increased 29% in 2022, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes, primarily driven by long-term customer contracts. Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Operating Income (Loss) North America $ 7,271 $ (2,847) International (924) (7,746) AWS 18,532 22,841 Consolidated $ 24,879 $ 12,248 Operating income was $24.9 billion and $12.2 billion for 2021 and 2022. We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The North America operating loss in 2022, as compared to the operating income in the prior year, is primarily due to increased fulfillment and shipping costs, due in part to increases in investments in our fulfillment network, transportation costs, and wage rates and incentives, increased technology and content costs, and growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted operating loss by $274 million in 2022. The increase in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased fulfillment and shipping costs, due in part to increases in investments in our fulfillment network, transportation costs, and wage rates and incentives, increased technology and content costs, and growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased advertising sales and increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted operating loss by $857 million in 2022. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales and cost structure productivity, including a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, all of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $1.4 billion in 2022. 24 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 272,344 $ 288,831 Fulfillment 75,111 84,299 Technology and content 56,052 73,213 Sales and marketing 32,551 42,238 General and administrative 8,823 11,891 Other operating expense (income), net 62 1,263 Total operating expenses $ 444,943 $ 501,735 Year-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline): Cost of sales 17 % 6 % Fulfillment 28 12 Technology and content 31 31 Sales and marketing 48 30 General and administrative 32 35 Other operating expense (income), net (183) 1,936 Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 58.0 % 56.2 % Fulfillment 16.0 16.4 Technology and content 11.9 14.2 Sales and marketing 6.9 8.2 General and administrative 1.9 2.3 Other operating expense (income), net 0.0 0.2 Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and product costs resulting from increased sales and increases in investments in our fulfillment network, transportation costs, and wage rates and incentives. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $10.8 billion in 2022. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $76.7 billion and $83.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related 25 Table of Contents transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased investments in our fulfillment network and variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, and increased wage rates and incentives. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced fulfillment costs by $2.5 billion in 2022. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities and higher marketing spend. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2022, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees. 26 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $62 million and $1.3 billion during 2021 and 2022, and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets and, for 2022, $1.1 billion of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $448 million and $989 million during 2021 and 2022, primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion in 2021 and 2022 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Our long-term lease liabilities were $67.7 billion and $73.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Our long-term debt was $48.7 billion and $67.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $14.6 billion and $(16.8) billion during 2021 and 2022. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2021 and 2022 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $11.8 billion and $(12.7) billion from our equity investment in Rivian. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. We recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes of $4.8 billion and $(3.2) billion in 2021 and 2022. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations. 27 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2021 and 2022 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 46,327 $ 46,752 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (55,396) (58,321) Free cash flow $ (9,069) $ (11,569) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (58,154) $ (37,601) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 6,291 $ 9,718 Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2021 and 2022 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 46,327 $ 46,752 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (55,396) (58,321) Free cash flow (9,069) (11,569) Principal repayments of finance leases (11,163) (7,941) Principal repayments of financing obligations (162) (248) Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations $ (20,394) $ (19,758) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (58,154) $ (37,601) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 6,291 $ 9,718 28 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2021 and 2022 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 46,327 $ 46,752 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (55,396) (58,321) Free cash flow (9,069) (11,569) Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (4,422) (299) Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (687) (670) Principal repayments of financing obligations (162) (248) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations $ (14,340) $ (12,786) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (58,154) $ (37,601) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 6,291 $ 9,718 ___________________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications” of $7,061 million and $675 million. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $11,163 million and $7,941 million. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022 As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) Net sales $ 469,822 $ (3,804) $ 466,018 $ 513,983 $ 15,495 $ 529,478 Operating expenses 444,943 (3,653) 441,290 501,735 16,356 518,091 Operating income 24,879 (151) 24,728 12,248 (861) 11,387 ___________________ (1) Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. (2) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. 29 Table of Contents Guidance We provided guidance on February 2, 2023, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” First Quarter 2023 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $121.0 billion and $126.0 billion, or to grow between 4% and 8% compared with first quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates. • Operating income is expected to be between $0 and $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022. • This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.

See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. 31 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk During 2022, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $15.0 billion in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2022, of $18.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $915 million, $1.8 billion, and $3.7 billion. We also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2022, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $275 million, $555 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates. Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2022, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $7.2 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian, represent $5.0 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2022, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 34 Table of Contents Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2022, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $4.0 billion for various tax contingencies. Auditing the recognition and measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management’s evaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted by regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over: the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; the measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the development of the related disclosures. We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the appropriateness of the Company’s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company’s calculations and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES Description of Business We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.” Common Stock Split On May 27, 2022, we effected a 20 -for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of authorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”), and per share or per RSU information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $ 0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from “Additional paid-in capital” to “Common stock.” Prior Period Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Other operating expense (income), net” was reclassified into “Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and capitalized content costs, operating lease assets, and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2022 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from four years to five years and for our networking equipment from five years to six years . The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2022, based on servers and networking equipment that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2021 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2022, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $ 3.6 billion and a benefit to net loss of $ 2.8 billion, or $ 0.28 per basic share and $ 0.28 per diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $ 1.1 billion, of which $ 720 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores. These charges were recorded in “Other operating expense (income), net” on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our North America segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded expenses of approximately 41 Table of Contents $ 480 million primarily in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations relating to terminating contracts for certain leases not yet commenced as well as other purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North America segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $ 720 million, of which $ 640 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in “Technology and content,” “Fulfillment,” and “General and administrative” on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our North America segment. Supplemental Cash Flow Information The following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 2022 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION: Cash paid for interest on debt $ 916 $ 1,098 $ 1,561 Cash paid for operating leases $ 4,475 $ 6,722 $ 8,633 Cash paid for interest on finance leases $ 612 $ 521 $ 374 Cash paid for interest on financing obligations $ 102 $ 153 $ 207 Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds $ 1,713 $ 3,688 $ 6,035 Assets acquired under operating leases $ 16,217 $ 25,369 $ 18,800 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications $ 11,588 $ 7,061 $ 675 Property and equipment recognized during the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements $ 2,267 $ 5,846 $ 3,187 Property and equipment derecognized after the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements, with the associated leases recognized as operating $ — $ 230 $ 5,158 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 2022 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 10,005 10,117 10,189 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 193 179 — Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 10,198 10,296 10,189 Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. 42 Table of Contents Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period. Advertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions. AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term. Other - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as certain licensing and distribution of video content and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed. Return Allowances Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $ 859 million, $ 1.0 billion, and $ 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Additions to the allowance were $ 3.5 billion, $ 5.1 billion, and $ 5.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $ 3.6 billion, $ 4.9 billion, and $ 5.2 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Included in “Inventories” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $ 852 million, $ 882 million, and $ 948 million as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. 43 Table of Contents Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties. Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $ 10.9 billion, $ 16.9 billion, and $ 20.6 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience by grant year and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets and, for 2020, a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor partially offset by a lease impairment and, for 2022, $ 1.1 billion of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 2022 Marketable equity securities valuation gains (losses) $ 525 $ 11,526 $ ( 13,870 ) Equity warrant valuation gains (losses) 1,527 1,315 ( 2,132 ) Upward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies 342 1,866 76 Foreign currency gains (losses) 35 ( 55 ) ( 340 ) Other, net ( 58 ) ( 19 ) ( 540 ) Total other income (expense), net 2,371 14,633 ( 16,806 ) 44 Table of Contents Included in other income (expense), net in 2021 and 2022 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $ 11.8 billion and $( 12.7 ) billion from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (“Rivian”). Our investment in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian’s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 17 % ownership interest, and an approximate 16 % voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles, and one of our employees serving on Rivian’s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets. Required summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 Revenues $ — $ 55 $ 995 Gross profit — ( 465 ) ( 2,123 ) Loss from operations ( 1,021 ) ( 4,220 ) ( 5,061 ) Net loss ( 1,018 ) ( 4,688 ) ( 5,029 ) December 31, 2021 September 30, 2022 Total current assets $ 18,559 $ 14,424 Total assets 22,294 19,023 Total current liabilities 1,313 2,109 Total liabilities 2,780 3,686 Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 45 Table of Contents Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, these warrants had a fair value of $ 3.4 billion and $ 2.1 billion, and are recorded within “ Other assets ” on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $ 2.6 billion and $ 2.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories. We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, customer receivables, net, were $ 20.2 billion and $ 26.6 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $ 5.3 billion and $ 6.9 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $ 1.0 billion and $ 1.3 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 1.1 billion, $ 1.1 billion, and $ 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Additions to the allowance were $ 1.4 billion, $ 1.0 billion, and $ 1.6 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $ 1.0 billion, $ 1.1 billion, and $ 1.3 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. 46 Table of Contents Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, four years prior to January 1, 2022 and five years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our servers, five years prior to January 1, 2022 and six years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. Leases We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property. Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone prices. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term. When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. Financing Obligations We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation. If we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash 47 Table of Contents flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. We completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2022, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.” Other Assets Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets and certain equity investments; and satellite network launch services deposits. We recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses. Digital Video and Music Content We obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively. Changes in historical and anticipated viewing patterns are lengthening the weighted average life of our capitalized video content. We anticipate the changes in viewing patterns will positively impact 2023 operating income by approximately $ 1.0 billion, generally ratably throughout the year. Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 were $ 10.7 billion and $ 16.7 billion. Total video and music expense was $ 13.0 billion and $ 16.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, these investments had a carrying value of $ 603 million and $ 715 million. Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method 48 Table of Contents investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Accrued Expenses and Other Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, tax-related liabilities, current debt, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, self-insurance liabilities, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $ 7.4 billion and $ 7.7 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $ 5.2 billion and $ 5.4 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns. Self-Insurance Liabilities Although we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively self-insure for exposure primarily related to workers’ compensation, employee health care benefits, general and product liability, and automobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development, inflation, and other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our total self-insurance liabilities were $ 2.2 billion and $ 4.0 billion and are included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $ 1.3 billion primarily driven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in “Cost of sales” on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $ 14.0 billion, of which $ 11.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $ 16.1 billion. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $ 2.2 billion and $ 2.9 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $ 110.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.7 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. 49 Table of Contents Other Long-Term Liabilities Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, digital video and music content, and deferred tax liabilities. Foreign Currency We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $( 118 ) million, $ 19 million, and $ 386 million in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. The following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions): December 31, 2021 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 10,942 $ — $ — $ 10,942 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 20,312 — — 20,312 Equity securities (1) 1,646 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 181 — — 181 U.S. government and agency securities 4,316 9 ( 25 ) 4,300 Corporate debt securities 35,810 75 ( 121 ) 35,764 Asset-backed securities 6,763 7 ( 32 ) 6,738 Other fixed income securities 688 2 ( 4 ) 686 Equity securities (1)(3) 15,740 $ 79,012 $ 93 $ ( 182 ) $ 96,309 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2) ( 260 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 96,049 50 Table of Contents December 31, 2022 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 10,666 $ — $ — $ 10,666 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 27,899 — — 27,899 Equity securities (1)(3) 3,709 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 537 — ( 2 ) 535 U.S. government and agency securities 2,301 — ( 155 ) 2,146 Corporate debt securities 23,111 — ( 484 ) 22,627 Asset-backed securities 2,721 — ( 149 ) 2,572 Other fixed income securities 249 — ( 12 ) 237 $ 67,484 $ — $ ( 802 ) $ 70,391 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2) ( 365 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 70,026 ___________________ (1) The related unrealized gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $ 448 million, $ 11.6 billion, and $( 13.6 ) billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. (2) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable fixed income securities primarily as collateral for real estate, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable fixed income securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as “Accounts receivable, net and other” and of twelve months or longer as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets.

We also assumed $ 2.5 billion of debt, which we repaid immediately after closing. The acquired assets primarily consist of $ 3.4 billion of video content and $ 4.9 billion of goodwill. During 2022, we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $ 141 million, net of cash acquired. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the 2022 acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant. Goodwill The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax purposes.

The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 13.1 years as of December 31, 2022. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $ 53.3 billion and $ 61.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. We have a $ 1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we increased from $ 1.0 billion to $ 1.5 billion in August 2022 and we may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25 %, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45 % on the undrawn portion. There were $ 803 million and $ 1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which had an interest rate of 1.5 % and 5.6 %, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we have pledged $ 918 million and $ 1.2 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. As of December 31, 2022, future principal payments for our total long-term debt were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2023 $ 3,000 2024 8,500 2025 5,249 2026 3,543 2027 8,750 Thereafter 41,500 $ 70,542 We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $ 20.0 billion (including up to € 3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. In March 2022, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Programs from $ 10.0 billion to $ 20.0 billion. There were $ 725 million and $ 6.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which were 56 Table of Contents included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.08 % and 4.47 %, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes. We have a $ 10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”), which was amended and restated in March 2022 to increase the borrowing capacity from $ 7.0 billion to $ 10.0 billion and to extend the term to March 2025. It may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45 %, with a commitment fee of 0.03 % on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. In November 2022, we entered into a $ 10.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Short-Term Credit Agreement”), which matures in November 2023 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45 %, with a commitment fee of 0.05 % on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022. We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $ 318 million and $ 1.2 billion of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets.

If we exercise our option to extend the Term Loan’s maturity to January 2025, the interest rate spread will increase from 0.75 % to 1.05 %. As of the date of this filing, the entire Term Loan is outstanding. 57 Table of Contents Note 7 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments, excluding open orders for purchases that support normal operations and are generally cancellable, as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Long-term debt principal and interest $ 5,165 $ 10,618 $ 7,146 $ 5,253 $ 10,399 $ 63,815 $ 102,396 Operating lease liabilities 9,574 8,658 8,024 7,393 6,675 40,949 81,273 Finance lease liabilities, including interest 4,575 2,248 1,422 1,279 1,088 7,407 18,019 Financing obligations, including interest (1) 465 464 456 464 471 6,712 9,032 Leases not yet commenced 1,252 2,043 2,185 2,160 2,152 17,237 27,029 Unconditional purchase obligations (2) 8,156 7,217 5,366 4,525 3,419 6,093 34,776 Other commitments (3)(4) 3,173 1,608 1,027 982 622 8,652 16,064 Total commitments $ 32,360 $ 32,856 $ 25,626 $ 22,056 $ 24,826 $ 150,865 $ 288,589 ___________________ (1) Includes non-cancellable financing obligations for fulfillment, sortation, and data center facilities. Excluding interest, current financing obligations of $ 196 million and $ 266 million are recorded within “Accrued expenses and other” and $ 6.2 billion and $ 6.7 billion are recorded within “Other long-term liabilities” as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 18.8 years and 17.9 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.2 % and 3.1 % as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. (2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction. (4) Excludes approximately $ 4.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any. In July 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) for approximately $ 3.9 billion, including its debt, subject to customary closing conditions. In August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation for approximately $ 1.7 billion, including its debt, subject to customary closing conditions. We expect to fund these acquisitions with cash on hand. Suppliers During 2022, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies We are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically relate to (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations. 58 Table of Contents Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects Within a Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’ fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $ 130 to $ 250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In May 2022, the district court granted summary judgment holding that the patent is invalid. In June 2022, Eolas filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages , an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled “Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol”; and 7,233,978, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In March 2022, the case was stayed pending resolution of review petitions we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In November 2022, the stay was lifted. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning in March 2020, with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon’s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys’ fees, and costs. In March 2022 and January 2023, Amazon’s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-Wilson and De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (WD Wash), respectively; both courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon’s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon’s pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General’s lawsuit in its entirety; the dismissal is under appeal as of January 2023. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In October 2020, BroadbandiTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and 10,536,751, each entitled “Video-On-Demand Content Delivery System for Providing Video-On-Demand Services to TV Services Subscribers”; 10,028,026, entitled “System for Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content on TV Services Platform of a Digital TV Services Provider”; and 9,973,825, entitled “Dynamic Adjustment of Electronic Program Guide Displays Based on Viewer Preferences for Minimizing Navigation in VOD Program Selection.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages. In April 2022, BroadbandiTV alleged in its damages report that, in the event of a finding of liability, Amazon could be subject to $ 166 to $ 986 million in damages. In September 2022, the court granted summary judgment, holding that the patents are invalid. In October 2022, BroadbandiTV filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. 59 Table of Contents In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers in a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections sought to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. In December 2022, the European Commission adopted formal commitments without fines, fully resolving the investigation. In July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the “CNPD”) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming that Amazon’s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of € 746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2021, Jawbone Innovations, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

In November 2022, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the “ICA”) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial actions and a fine of € 1.13 billion, which we are paying and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. We believe the ICA’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In July 2022, Acceleration Bay, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Lambda, Amazon Lumberyard, Luna, Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, Amazon GameLift, GridMate, Amazon EKS, AWS App Mesh, and Amazon VPC infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,701,344, entitled “Distributed Game Environment”; 6,714,966, entitled “Information Delivery Service”; 6,732,147, entitled “Leaving a Broadcast Channel”; 6,829,634, entitled “Broadcasting Network”; and 6,910,069, entitled “Joining a Broadcast Channel.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2022, LightGuide, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services LLC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon’s Nike Intent Detection System used in certain fulfillment centers infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,515,981, entitled “Light Guided Assembly System”; and 9,658,614 and 10,528,036, each entitled “Light Guided Assembly System and Method.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, li tigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

No preferred stock was outstanding for any year presented. Common Stock Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.4 billion, 10.5 billion, and 10.6 billion, as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. Stock Repurchase Activity In March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $ 10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration, which replaced the previous $ 5.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in February 2016. We repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for $ 6.0 billion in 2022 under these programs. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2020 or 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we have $ 6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program. Stock Award Plans Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years . Stock Award Activity Stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 2022 Cost of sales $ 283 $ 540 $ 757 Fulfillment 1,357 1,946 2,745 Technology and content 5,061 6,645 10,621 Sales and marketing 1,710 2,530 3,875 General and administrative 797 1,096 1,623 Total stock-based compensation expense (1) $ 9,208 $ 12,757 $ 19,621 ___________________ (1) The related tax benefits were $ 1.9 billion, $ 2.7 billion, and $ 4.3 billion for 2020, 2021, and 2022. The following table summarizes our restricted stock unit activity (in millions): Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding as of January 1, 2020 286.7 $ 73 Units granted 158.6 119 Units vested ( 115.5 ) 62 Units forfeited ( 26.5 ) 82 Outstanding as of December 31, 2020 303.3 100 Units granted 127.3 167 Units vested ( 108.4 ) 85 Units forfeited ( 42.3 ) 116 Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 279.9 134 Units granted 262.8 142 Units vested ( 113.3 ) 114 Units forfeited ( 45.0 ) 143 Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 384.4 144 61 Table of Contents Scheduled vesting for outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2022, is as follows (in millions): Year Ended 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Scheduled vesting — restricted stock units 140.8 136.6 67.3 35.8 1.7 2.2 384.4 As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 23.8 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with more than half of the compensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a remaining weighted-average recognition period of 1.1 years. The estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 was 26.7 %, 26.5 %, and 26.5 %. Changes in our estimates and assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. During 2020, 2021, and 2022, the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $ 15.5 billion, $ 18.2 billion, and $ 12.8 billion. Common Stock Available for Future Issuance As of December 31, 2022, common stock available for future issuance to employees is 1.7 billion shares. Note 9 — INCOME TAXES In 2020, 2021, and 2022, we recorded net tax provision (benefit) of $ 2.9 billion, $ 4.8 billion, and $( 3.2 ) billion. Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $ 1.7 billion, $ 3.7 billion, and $ 6.0 billion for 2020, 2021, and 2022. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included a partial election for 2020 and 2021, and a full election for 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes. The components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes, net are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 2022 U.S. Federal: Current $ 1,835 $ 2,129 $ 2,175 Deferred ( 151 ) 155 ( 6,686 ) Total 1,684 2,284 ( 4,511 ) U.S. State: Current 626 763 1,074 Deferred ( 190 ) ( 178 ) ( 1,302 ) Total 436 585 ( 228 ) International: Current 956 2,209 1,682 Deferred ( 213 ) ( 287 ) ( 160 ) Total 743 1,922 1,522 Provision (benefit) for income taxes, net $ 2,863 $ 4,791 $ ( 3,217 ) U.S. and international components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 2022 U.S. $ 20,219 $ 35,879 $ ( 8,225 ) International 3,959 2,272 2,289 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 24,178 $ 38,151 $ ( 5,936 ) 62 Table of Contents The items accounting for differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision recorded for income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 2022 Income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate $ 5,078 $ 8,012 $ ( 1,246 ) Effect of: Tax impact of foreign earnings and losses ( 538 ) ( 1,349 ) ( 370 ) State taxes, net of federal benefits 343 465 ( 173 ) Tax credits ( 639 ) ( 1,136 ) ( 1,006 ) Stock-based compensation (1) ( 1,107 ) ( 1,094 ) 612 Foreign income deduction (2) ( 372 ) ( 301 ) ( 1,258 ) Other, net 98 194 224 Total $ 2,863 $ 4,791 $ ( 3,217 ) ___________________ (1) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits or shortfalls from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $ 1.8 billion and $ 1.9 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2020 and 2021, and a $ 33 million tax shortfall from stock-based compensation for 2022. (2) U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction. Our provision for income taxes in 2021 was higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was partially offset by an increase in U.S. federal research and development credits and the impact of the distribution of certain intangible assets from Luxembourg to the U.S. in Q4 2021, resulting in the utilization of $ 2.6 billion of Luxembourg deferred tax assets previously subject to a valuation allowance. We generated an income tax benefit in 2022 as compared to a provision for income taxes in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in pretax income and an increase in the foreign income deduction. This was partially offset by a reduction in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable effects of corporate restructuring transactions. The foreign income deduction benefit recognized in 2022 reflects a change in our application of tax regulations related to the computation of qualifying foreign income and includes an income tax benefit of approximately $ 655 million related to years prior to 2022. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. 63 Table of Contents Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2021 2022 Deferred tax assets (1): Loss carryforwards U.S. - Federal/States 228 386 Loss carryforwards - Foreign 2,417 2,831 Accrued liabilities, reserves, and other expenses 2,821 3,280 Stock-based compensation 2,738 4,295 Depreciation and amortization 941 1,009 Operating lease liabilities 15,399 18,285 Capitalized research and development — 6,824 Other items 603 1,023 Tax credits 626 950 Total gross deferred tax assets 25,773 38,883 Less valuation allowances (2) ( 3,596 ) ( 4,374 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 22,177 34,509 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 3,562 ) ( 9,039 ) Operating lease assets ( 14,422 ) ( 17,140 ) Assets held for investment ( 4,019 ) — Other items ( 668 ) ( 817 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowances $ ( 494 ) $ 7,513 ___________________ (1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies. (2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions or future capital gains, as well as tax credits. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2022. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $ 10.4 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2023. Tax Contingencies We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. 64 Table of Contents The reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions): December 31, 2020 2021 2022 Gross tax contingencies – January 1 $ 3,923 $ 2,820 $ 3,242 Gross increases to tax positions in prior periods 88 403 274 Gross decreases to tax positions in prior periods ( 465 ) ( 354 ) ( 172 ) Gross increases to current period tax positions 507 507 706 Settlements with tax authorities ( 1,207 ) ( 60 ) ( 20 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 26 ) ( 74 ) ( 28 ) Gross tax contingencies – December 31 (1) $ 2,820 $ 3,242 $ 4,002 ___________________ (1) As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $ 4.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $ 2.2 billion, if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $ 110 million and $ 103 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 were $( 48 ) million, $ 28 million, and $( 7 ) million. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income. In September 2022, the Luxembourg Tax Authority (“LTA”) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. We believe the LTA’s position is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In February 2023, we received a decision by the Indian Tax Authority (“ITA”) that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to the U.S. We will need to remit taxes on the services in question, including for a portion of prior years, until this matter is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe the ITA’s decision is without merit, we intend to defend our position vigorously, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this matter is adversely resolved, we would reflect significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid. In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately € 250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission’s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. 65 Table of Contents Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. North America The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants On Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 69 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington February 2, 2023 70 Table of Contents Item 9B.

Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I — “Risk Factors.” As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. General We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Consumers We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, and Ring, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes fast, free shipping on millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, and other benefits. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.” Sellers We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs. Developers and Enterprises We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. Content Creators We serve authors and independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. Advertisers We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. 3 Table of Contents Competition Our businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Human Capital Our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,608,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business. As we strive to be Earth’s best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (funded education for hourly employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback. 4 Table of Contents Available Information Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases.

Risk Factors Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in the risk factors below, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Business and Industry Risks We Face Intense Competition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation. Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • local economic and political conditions; • government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership; • restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal 6 Table of Contents precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; • business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices; • limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; • limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; • shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; • laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; • lower levels of use of the Internet; • lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; • lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; • difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; • different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; • compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; • laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and • geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth. The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable 7 Table of Contents to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand. We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service. We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and 8 Table of Contents Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa. Operating Risks Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following: • our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands; • our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; • our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; • the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; • changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; • timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; • the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; • the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth; • the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; • variations in the mix of products and services we sell; • variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; • the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; • factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics); • the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; • increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products; • constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs; • the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; • our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; • the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings; 9 Table of Contents • the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and • disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade disputes, and similar events. We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition, failure to optimize inventory or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network currently is being affected by global supply chain constraints and constrained labor markets, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like. We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time and, if successful, those organizational efforts may decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our fulfillment network operating efficiency. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events. We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches Because we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented. We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results. 10 Table of Contents Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises), or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • impairment of other relationships; 11 Table of Contents • variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and • difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • problems retaining key personnel; • additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; • the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions; • the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations; • the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; • the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; • the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented; • losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our financial results; • for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, or investments for which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes; • the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company; • the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face; • potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and • for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results. We Face Significant Inventory Risk In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results. 12 Table of Contents We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services. We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as: • changes in interest rates; • conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in; • quarterly variations in operating results; • fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular; • changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels; • changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; • changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; • changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and • transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both. Legal and Regulatory Risks Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting 13 Table of Contents requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations violate competition rules, including aspects of Amazon’s European marketplace for sellers, particularly with respect to use of data, fulfillment services, and featured offers. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks. Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations. We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, 14 Table of Contents consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date. Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities. We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle 1 . On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales 1 The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 18 Table of Contents by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 518 million and 523 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. 19 Table of Contents Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2021, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $370 million. In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 66,064 $ 46,327 Investing activities (59,611) (58,154) Financing activities (1,104) 6,291 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $84.4 billion and $96.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $23.5 billion and $22.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, and were primarily British Pounds, Euros, Japanese Yen, and Canadian Dollars. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $66.1 billion and $46.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2021, compared to the prior year, was 20 Table of Contents primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(59.6) billion and $(58.2) billion in 2020 and 2021, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $35.0 billion, and $55.4 billion in 2020 and 2021, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.1) billion and $6.3 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $17.3 billion and $27.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $18.4 billion and $20.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $11.6 billion and $7.1 billion in 2020 and 2021, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS. We had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility, $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs, and $803 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. As of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $7.6 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion for 2020 and 2021. Effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which will delay the deductibility of these expenses and potentially increase the amount of cash taxes we pay. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $257 million and $260 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. We expect to fund the acquisition of MGM Holdings Inc. with cash on hand. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Overview As reflected in the discussion below, ongoing direct and indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to them had varying effects on our 2021 results of operations, although some effects, including customer demand, are mitigating or becoming more difficult to isolate or quantify. Moreover, it is not possible to determine the duration and scope of the pandemic, the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic, any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns, supply chain disruptions, and labor availability and costs, or the impact of other indirect factors that may be attributable to the pandemic, and the extent to which these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations. However, we expect our net sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. In addition, these direct and indirect factors can make it difficult to isolate and quantify the portion of our costs that are a direct result of the pandemic and costs arising from factors that may have been influenced by the pandemic, including increased wage rates and incentives, increased carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from constrained labor markets and global supply chain constraints. We expect these factors and their effects on our operations to continue into Q1 2022. 22 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 Net Sales: North America $ 236,282 $ 279,833 International 104,412 127,787 AWS 45,370 62,202 Consolidated $ 386,064 $ 469,822 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 38 % 18 % International 40 22 AWS 30 37 Consolidated 38 22 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America 38 % 18 % International 38 20 AWS 30 37 Consolidated 37 21 Net sales mix: North America 61 % 60 % International 27 27 AWS 12 13 Consolidated 100 % 100 % Sales increased 22% in 2021, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $1.4 billion and $3.8 billion for 2020 and 2021. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below. North America sales increased 18% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. We expect our North America sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. International sales increased 22% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. We expect our International sales growth rate to decelerate in Q1 2022 compared to the increase we experienced in Q1 2021. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $1.7 billion and $3.0 billion in 2020 and 2021. AWS sales increased 37% in 2021, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 23 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 Operating Income (Loss): North America $ 8,651 $ 7,271 International 717 (924) AWS 13,531 18,532 Consolidated $ 22,899 $ 24,879 Operating income was $22.9 billion and $24.9 billion for 2020 and 2021. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The decrease in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased wage rates and incentives, increased carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies, and growth in certain operating expenses, including marketing, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $8 million and $88 million for 2020 and 2021. The International operating loss in 2021, as compared to the operating income in the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased wage rates and incentives, and increased carrier rates, and growth in certain operating expenses, including marketing, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $411 million and $435 million for 2020 and 2021. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, all of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth, and reduced prices for our customers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $30 million and $(372) million for 2020 and 2021. 24 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 233,307 $ 272,344 Fulfillment 58,517 75,111 Technology and content 42,740 56,052 Marketing 22,008 32,551 General and administrative 6,668 8,823 Other operating expense (income), net (75) 62 Total operating expenses $ 363,165 $ 444,943 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales 41 % 17 % Fulfillment 45 28 Technology and content 19 31 Marketing 17 48 General and administrative 28 32 Other operating expense (income), net (137) (183) Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 60.4 % 58.0 % Fulfillment 15.2 16.0 Technology and content 11.1 11.9 Marketing 5.7 6.9 General and administrative 1.7 1.9 Other operating expense (income), net — — Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, costs from expanding our fulfillment network, as well as increased carrier rates, increased wage rates and incentives, and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from a constrained labor market and global supply chain constraints. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $61.1 billion and $76.7 billion in 2020 and 2021. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and 25 Table of Contents content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, increased wage rates and incentives and fulfillment network inefficiencies resulting from a constrained labor market and global supply chain constraints, and costs from expanding our fulfillment network. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2022 due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment, which will primarily impact our AWS segment. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment. Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to higher marketing spend, which was constrained in 2020 in response to COVID-19, and increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional fees. 26 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $(75) million and $62 million during 2020 and 2021, and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in 2020, offset by a lease impairment in 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $555 million and $448 million during 2020 and 2021. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in 2020 and 2021 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. Our long-term lease liabilities were $52.6 billion and $67.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Our long-term debt was $31.8 billion and $48.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $2.4 billion and $14.6 billion during 2020 and 2021. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2021 is a valuation gain of $11.8 billion from our equity securities of Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November 2021. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.9 billion and $4.8 billion in 2020 and 2021. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations. 27 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2020 and 2021 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 66,064 $ 46,327 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (35,044) (55,396) Free cash flow $ 31,020 $ (9,069) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (59,611) $ (58,154) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (1,104) $ 6,291 Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2020 and 2021 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 66,064 $ 46,327 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (35,044) (55,396) Free cash flow 31,020 (9,069) Principal repayments of finance leases (10,642) (11,163) Principal repayments of financing obligations (53) (162) Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations $ 20,325 $ (20,394) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (59,611) $ (58,154) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (1,104) $ 6,291 28 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2020 and 2021 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2021 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 66,064 $ 46,327 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (35,044) (55,396) Free cash flow 31,020 (9,069) Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (9,104) (4,422) Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (427) (687) Principal repayments of financing obligations (53) (162) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations $ 21,436 $ (14,340) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (59,611) $ (58,154) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (1,104) $ 6,291 ___________________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of $11,588 million and $7,061 million. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $10,642 million and $11,163 million. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2020 Year Ended December 31, 2021 As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) Net sales $ 386,064 $ (1,438) $ 384,626 $ 469,822 $ (3,804) $ 466,018 Operating expenses 363,165 (989) 362,176 444,943 (3,653) 441,290 Operating income 22,899 (449) 22,450 24,879 (151) 24,728 ___________________ (1) Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. (2) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. 29 Table of Contents Guidance We provided guidance on February 3, 2022, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 3, 2022, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as uncertainty regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, labor market and global supply chain constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 3, 2022 regarding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations as well as the effect of other factors discussed above. First Quarter 2022 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $112.0 billion and $117.0 billion, or to grow between 3% and 8% compared with first quarter 2021. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 150 basis points from foreign exchange rates. • Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in first quarter 2021. This guidance includes approximately $1.0 billion lower depreciation expense due to increases in the estimated useful lives of our servers and networking equipment beginning on January 1, 2022. • This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2021 (in millions, except percentages): 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2021 Money market funds $ 20,312 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 20,312 $ 20,312 Weighted average interest rate (0.02) % — % — % — % — % — % (0.02) % Corporate debt securities 18,063 6,253 8,231 2,044 921 — 35,512 35,764 Weighted average interest rate 0.34 % 1.02 % 1.02 % 1.35 % 1.22 % — % 0.70 % U.S. government and agency securities 1,584 837 561 672 558 61 4,273 4,300 Weighted average interest rate 0.30 % 0.39 % 1.00 % 1.14 % 0.99 % 1.01 % 0.65 % Asset-backed securities 1,237 1,966 1,722 959 312 500 6,696 6,738 Weighted average interest rate 1.19 % 0.93 % 1.28 % 1.27 % 0.99 % 1.14 % 1.14 % Foreign government and agency securities 105 52 22 — — — 179 181 Weighted average interest rate 0.97 % 1.12 % 0.74 % — % — % — % 0.98 % Other fixed income securities 142 264 222 57 — — 685 686 Weighted average interest rate 0.65 % 0.93 % 0.68 % 1.35 % — % — % 0.83 % $ 41,443 $ 9,372 $ 10,758 $ 3,732 $ 1,791 $ 561 $ 67,657 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 67,981 As of December 31, 2021, we had long-term debt with a face value of $50.6 billion, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. 31 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Risk During 2021, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $3.0 billion in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2021, of $22.7 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.1 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.5 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2021, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $285 million, $575 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates. Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2021, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $22.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which primarily relate to Rivian Automotive, Inc., represent $20.3 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2021, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Page Report of Ernst & Young LLP , Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ( PCAOB ID: 42 ) 34 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 36 Consolidated Statements of Operations 37 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 38 Consolidated Balance Sheets 39 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity 40 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 41 33 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 34 Table of Contents Income Taxes Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Auditing the recognition and measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management’s evaluation of tax positions may involve the use of valuation methodologies and assumptions, including forecasts of income or loss, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, including the selection of valuation methodologies and assumptions; determination of forecasts of income or loss; and development of the related disclosures. We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation methodologies and assumptions, including the determination of forecasts of income or loss, and the accuracy of the Company’s calculations and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We have also evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES Description of Business We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.” Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, and valuation and impairment of investments. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. For example, in Q4 2021 we completed a useful life study for our servers and networking equipment and are increasing the useful lives from four years to five years for servers and from five years to six years for networking equipment in January 2022, which, based on servers and networking equipment that are included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2021, will have an anticipated impact to our 2022 operating income of $ 3.1 billion. We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from three years to four years in January 2020. Supplemental Cash Flow Information The following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION: Cash paid for interest on debt $ 875 $ 916 $ 1,098 Cash paid for operating leases $ 3,361 $ 4,475 $ 6,722 Cash paid for interest on finance leases $ 647 $ 612 $ 521 Cash paid for interest on financing obligations $ 39 $ 102 $ 153 Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds $ 881 $ 1,713 $ 3,688 Assets acquired under operating leases $ 7,870 $ 16,217 $ 25,369 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases $ 13,723 $ 11,588 $ 7,061 Property and equipment acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements $ 1,362 $ 2,267 $ 5,616 41 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 494 500 506 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 10 10 9 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 504 510 515 Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period. Advertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions. AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term. Other - Other revenue includes sales related to various other service offerings, which are recognized as or when those services are performed. Return Allowances Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $ 712 million, $ 859 million, and $ 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Additions to the allowance were $ 2.5 billion, $ 3.5 billion, and $ 5.1 billion and deductions from the allowance were $ 2.5 billion, $ 3.6 billion, and $ 4.9 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Included in “Inventories” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $ 629 million, $ 852 million, and $ 882 million as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. 42 Table of Contents Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred. Marketing Marketing costs primarily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties. Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $ 11.0 billion, $ 10.9 billion, and $ 16.9 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock 43 Table of Contents appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Marketable equity securities valuation gains (losses) $ 7 $ 525 $ 11,526 Equity warrant valuation gains (losses) 11 1,527 1,315 Upward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies 328 342 1,866 Foreign currency gains (losses) ( 20 ) 35 ( 55 ) Other, net ( 123 ) ( 58 ) ( 19 ) Total other income (expense), net 203 2,371 14,633 Included in other income (expense), net in 2021 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain of $ 11.8 billion from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (“Rivian”). Our investment in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian’s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 18 % ownership interest, and an approximate 16 % voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles, and one of our employees serving on Rivian’s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, and the 2021 valuation gain is primarily comprised of the gain recognized upon the initial public offering, and also includes subsequent changes in fair value through December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our equity investment in Rivian had a fair value of $ 15.6 billion, which reflects a discount for lack of marketability until Q1 2022 of approximately $ 800 million due to regulatory sales restrictions, and is included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets. Summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its SEC filings is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 Revenues $ — $ — $ 1 Gross profit — — ( 82 ) Loss from operations ( 409 ) ( 1,021 ) ( 1,766 ) Net loss ( 426 ) ( 1,018 ) ( 2,227 ) December 31, 2020 September 30, 2021 Total current assets $ 3,016 $ 5,345 Total assets 4,602 8,488 Total current liabilities 611 1,047 Total liabilities 742 4,201 Contingently redeemable convertible preferred stock 5,244 7,894 44 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these warrants had a fair value of $ 3.0 billion and $ 3.4 billion, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. 45 Table of Contents We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories. We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, customer receivables, net, were $ 14.8 billion and $ 20.2 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $ 4.8 billion and $ 5.3 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $ 381 million and $ 1.0 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 718 million, $ 1.1 billion, and $ 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Additions to the allowance were $ 1.0 billion, $ 1.4 billion, and $ 1.0 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $ 793 million, $ 1.0 billion, and $ 1.1 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years prior to January 1, 2020 and four years subsequent to January 1, 2020 for our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. Leases We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property. Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone prices. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term. 46 Table of Contents When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. Financing Obligations We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation. If we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. We completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2021, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.” Other Assets Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and certain equity investments. Digital Video and Music Content We obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.6 years. Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $ 6.8 billion and $ 10.7 billion. 47 Table of Contents Total video and music expense was $ 11.0 billion and $ 13.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, these investments had a carrying value of $ 2.7 billion and $ 603 million. Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Accrued Expenses and Other Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, tax-related liabilities, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $ 7.6 billion and $ 9.1 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $ 4.7 billion and $ 5.2 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns. 48 Table of Contents Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $ 11.6 billion, of which $ 9.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $ 14.0 billion. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $ 1.9 billion and $ 2.2 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $ 80.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.8 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. Other Long-Term Liabilities Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, deferred tax liabilities, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content. Foreign Currency We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $( 95 ) million, $( 118 ) million, and $ 19 million in 2019, 2020, and 2021. 49 Table of Contents Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. The following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions): December 31, 2020 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 10,063 $ — $ — $ 10,063 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 27,430 — — 27,430 Equity securities (1) 617 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 5,130 1 — 5,131 U.S. government and agency securities 7,410 30 ( 1 ) 7,439 Corporate debt securities 29,684 305 ( 1 ) 29,988 Asset-backed securities 3,206 32 ( 3 ) 3,235 Other fixed income securities 701 9 — 710 Equity securities (1) 40 $ 83,624 $ 377 $ ( 5 ) $ 84,653 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2) ( 257 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 84,396 50 Table of Contents December 31, 2021 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 10,942 $ — $ — $ 10,942 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 20,312 — — 20,312 Equity securities (1) 1,646 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 181 — — 181 U.S. government and agency securities 4,316 9 ( 25 ) 4,300 Corporate debt securities 35,810 75 ( 121 ) 35,764 Asset-backed securities 6,763 7 ( 32 ) 6,738 Other fixed income securities 688 2 ( 4 ) 686 Equity securities (1)(3) 15,740 $ 79,012 $ 93 $ ( 182 ) $ 96,309 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2) ( 260 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 96,049 ___________________ (1) The related unrealized gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $ 4 million, $ 448 million, and $ 11.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. (2) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable fixed income securities primarily as collateral for real estate, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable fixed income securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as “Accounts receivable, net and other” and of twelve months or longer as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies.” (3) Our equity investment in Rivian of $ 15.6 billion reflects a discount for lack of marketability until Q1 2022 due to regulatory sales restrictions. In addition, we are subject to contractual sales restrictions until Q2 2022. The following table summarizes gross gains and gross losses realized on sales of marketable fixed income securities (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Realized gains $ 11 $ 92 $ 85 Realized losses 7 56 38 The following table summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities as of December 31, 2021 (in millions): Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value Due within one year $ 39,070 $ 39,075 Due after one year through five years 22,790 22,712 Due after five years through ten years 2,124 2,121 Due after ten years 4,086 4,073 Total $ 68,070 $ 67,981 Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have certain prepayment conditions. 51 Table of Contents Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Reconciliation The following table provides a reconciliation of the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 42,122 $ 36,220 Restricted cash included in accounts receivable, net and other 233 242 Restricted cash included in other assets 22 15 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 42,377 $ 36,477 Note 3 — PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment, at cost, consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, 2020 2021 Gross property and equipment (1): Land and buildings $ 57,324 $ 81,104 Equipment 97,224 128,683 Other assets 3,772 4,118 Construction in progress 15,228 24,895 Gross property and equipment 173,548 238,800 Total accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 60,434 78,519 Total property and equipment, net $ 113,114 $ 160,281 __________________ (1) Includes the original cost and accumulated depreciation of fully-depreciated assets. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $ 15.1 billion, $ 16.2 billion, and $ 22.9 billion which includes amortization of property and equipment acquired under finance leases of $ 10.1 billion, $ 8.5 billion, and $ 9.9 billion for 2019, 2020, and 2021. 52 Table of Contents Note 4 — LEASES We have entered into non-cancellable operating and finance leases for fulfillment, delivery, office, physical store, data center, and sortation facilities as well as server and networking equipment, vehicles, and aircraft. Gross assets acquired under finance leases, inclusive of those where title transfers at the end of the lease, are recorded in “ Property and equipment, net ” and were $ 68.1 billion and $ 72.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Accumulated amortization associated with finance leases was $ 36.5 billion and $ 43.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.

The primary reason for all acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of 2021 acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Goodwill The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax purposes. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2020 and 2021 by segment (in millions): North America International AWS Consolidated Goodwill - January 1, 2020 $ 12,264 $ 1,300 $ 1,190 $ 14,754 New acquisitions 204 6 2 212 Other adjustments (1) 59 ( 18 ) 10 51 Goodwill - December 31, 2020 12,527 1,288 1,202 15,017 New acquisitions 230 60 76 366 Other adjustments (1) 1 ( 21 ) 8 ( 12 ) Goodwill - December 31, 2021 $ 12,758 $ 1,327 $ 1,286 $ 15,371 ___________________ (1) Primarily includes changes in foreign exchange rates. 54 Table of Contents Intangible Assets Acquired identifiable intangible assets are valued primarily by using discounted cash flows.

(2) Finite-lived intangible assets have estimated useful lives of between one and twenty-five years , and are being amortized to operating expenses on a straight-line basis. (3) Intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are in-process and used in research and development activities are considered indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the research and development efforts. Once the research and development efforts are completed, we determine the useful life and begin amortizing the assets. Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangibles was $ 565 million, $ 509 million, and $ 512 million in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Expected future amortization expense of acquired finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 $ 528 2023 452 2024 378 2025 318 2026 290 Thereafter 1,994 $ 3,960 55 Table of Contents Note 6 — DEBT As of December 31, 2021, we had $ 49.7 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (the “Notes”). We issued $ 18.5 billion of Notes in May 2021, of which $ 1.0 billion was issued for green or social projects, such as projects related to clean transportation, renewable energy, sustainable buildings, affordable housing, or socioeconomic advancement and empowerment, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. We also had other long-term debt and borrowings under our credit facility of $ 924 million and $ 803 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Our total long-term debt obligations are as follows (in millions): Maturities (1) Stated Interest Rates Effective Interest Rates December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 2012 Notes issuance of $ 3.0 billion 2022 2.50 % 2.66 % 1,250 1,250 2014 Notes issuance of $ 6.0 billion 2024 - 2044 3.80 % - 4.95 % 3.90 % - 5.11 % 5,000 4,000 2017 Notes issuance of $ 17.0 billion 2023 - 2057 2.40 % - 5.20 % 2.56 % - 4.33 % 16,000 16,000 2020 Notes issuance of $ 10.0 billion 2023 - 2060 0.40 % - 2.70 % 0.56 % - 2.77 % 10,000 10,000 2021 Notes issuance of $ 18.5 billion 2023 - 2061 0.25 % - 3.25 % 0.35 % - 3.31 % — 18,500 Credit Facility 338 803 Other long-term debt 586 — Total face value of long-term debt 33,174 50,553 Unamortized discount and issuance costs, net ( 203 ) ( 318 ) Less current portion of long-term debt ( 1,155 ) ( 1,491 ) Long-term debt $ 31,816 $ 48,744 ___________________ (1) The weighted-average remaining lives of the 2012, 2014, 2017, 2020 and 2021 Notes were 0.9 , 13.6 , 15.2 , 17.7 and 14.3 years as of December 31, 2021. The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 14.9 years as of December 31, 2021. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $ 37.7 billion and $ 53.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. We have a $ 1.0 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we increased from $ 740 million in November 2021 and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until October 2022, bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.40 %, and has a commitment fee of 0.50 % on the undrawn portion. There were $ 338 million and $ 803 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, which had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.0 % and 2.7 %, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we have pledged $ 398 million and $ 918 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. As of December 31, 2021, future principal payments for our total long-term debt were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 $ 1,493 2023 3,560 2024 5,750 2025 2,250 2026 2,750 Thereafter 34,750 $ 50,553 We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $ 10.0 billion (including up to € 3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were $ 725 million of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective interest rate, including 56 Table of Contents issuance costs, of 0.11 % and 0.08 %, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes. We also have a $ 7.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders with a term that extends to June 2023, which was amended in November 2021 to replace LIBOR as the applicable benchmark rate for loans denominated in certain foreign currencies (the “Credit Agreement”). It may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.50 %, with a commitment fee of 0.04 % on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. These amounts are included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $ 7.2 billion of unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2021. Note 7 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments, excluding open orders for purchases that support normal operations and are generally cancellable, as of December 31, 2021 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total Long-term debt principal and interest $ 2,841 $ 4,852 $ 7,014 $ 3,400 $ 3,829 $ 52,784 $ 74,720 Operating lease liabilities 7,838 7,178 6,649 6,128 5,574 32,902 66,269 Finance lease liabilities, including interest 8,278 4,772 2,278 1,355 1,220 7,963 25,866 Financing obligations, including interest (1) 423 422 419 410 417 6,404 8,495 Leases not yet commenced 1,206 1,902 2,094 2,145 2,237 21,571 31,155 Unconditional purchase obligations (2) 5,969 5,910 5,158 4,213 4,159 9,493 34,902 Other commitments (3)(4) 2,905 1,620 1,290 1,006 1,137 11,325 19,283 Total commitments $ 29,460 $ 26,656 $ 24,902 $ 18,657 $ 18,573 $ 142,442 $ 260,690 ___________________ (1) Includes non-cancellable financing obligations for fulfillment, sortation, and data center facilities. Excluding interest, current financing obligations of $ 111 million and $ 196 million are recorded within “Accrued expenses and other” and $ 3.4 billion and $ 6.2 billion are recorded within “Other long-term liabilities” as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 19.0 and 18.8 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.8 % and 3.2 % as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. (2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (3) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction, asset retirement obligations, and liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year. (4) Excludes approximately $ 3.2 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any. In addition, in May 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire MGM Holdings Inc. (“MGM”) for approximately $ 8.5 billion, including MGM’s debt, subject to customary closing conditions. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash on hand. Suppliers During 2021, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. 57 Table of Contents Other Contingencies We are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax contr oversies typically relate to (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects Within A Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’ fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $ 130 -$ 250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled “Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol,” and 7,233,978, entitled “Method And Apparatus For Managing Location Information In A Network Separate From The Data To Which The Location Information Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning in March 2020, with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, a number of cases have been filed in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and third-party sellers in Amazon’s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Some of the cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. Individuals have also initiated arbitrations based on substantially similar allegations. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers in a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections seeks to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the “CNPD”) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l. claiming that Amazon’s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of € 746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2021, Jawbone Innovations, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Echo smart speakers and displays, Fire TV Cube, and Echo Buds infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,246,058, entitled “Detecting Voiced and Unvoiced Speech Using Both Acoustic and Nonacoustic Sensors”; 8,019,091, entitled “Voice Activity 58 Table of Contents Detector (VAD)-Based Multiple-Microphone Acoustic Noise Suppression”; 8,280,072, entitled “Microphone Array with Rear Venting”; 8,321,213 and 8,326,611, both entitled “Acoustic Voice Activity Detection (AVAD) for Electronic Systems”; 8,467,543, entitled “Microphone and Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Configurations for Use with Communications Systems”; 10,779,080, entitled “Dual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA)”; and 11,122,357, entitled “Forming Virtual Microphone Arrays Using Dual Omnidirectional Microphone Array (DOMA).” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the “ICA”) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringed EU competition rules. The decision imposes a fine of € 1.13 billion and remedial actions. We believe the ICA’s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In January 2022, VideoLabs, Inc. and VL Collective IP LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Glow, Amazon Echo Show, Fire TV, Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick, Fire Tablets, AWS Elemental MediaConvert, AWS Elemental Live, AWS Elemental Server, AWS Elemental MediaPackage, AWS Elemental MediaLive, and Amazon Elastic Transcoder infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,769,238 and 8,139,878, both entitled “Picture Coding Method and Picture Decoding Method”; and 7,970,059, entitled “Variable Length Coding Method and Variable Length Decoding Method”; that Amazon Prime Video, AWS Elemental MediaConvert, AWS Elemental Live, AWS Elemental Server, AWS Elemental MediaPackage, AWS Elemental MediaLive, Amazon Elastic Transcoder, and Amazon Kinesis Video Streams infringe U.S. Patent No. 8,605,794, entitled “Method for Synchronizing Content-Dependent Data Segments of Files”; that Amazon Echo Show, Amazon Echo Spot, Amazon Connect, Amazon Chime, and Amazon Kinesis Video Streams infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,266,682, entitled “Method and System for Transmitting Data from a Transmitter to a Receiver and Transmitter and Receiver Therefore”; that AWS Auto Scaling and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,880,156, entitled “Demand Responsive Method and Apparatus to Automatically Activate Spare Servers”; and that Amazon Prime Video infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,440,559, entitled “System and Associated Terminal, Method and Computer Program Product for Controlling the Flow of Content.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See also “Note 9 — Income Taxes.” Note 8 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock We have authorized 500 million shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock. No preferred stock was outstanding for any year presented. Common Stock Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 512 million, 518 million, and 523 million, as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. 59 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Activity In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $ 5.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2019, 2020, or 2021. During the period from January 1, 2022 through February 2, 2022, we repurchased 0.5 million shares of our common stock for $ 1.3 billion. Stock Award Plans Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years . Stock Award Activity Stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Cost of sales $ 149 $ 283 $ 540 Fulfillment 1,182 1,357 1,946 Technology and content 3,725 5,061 6,645 Marketing 1,135 1,710 2,530 General and administrative 673 797 1,096 Total stock-based compensation expense (1) $ 6,864 $ 9,208 $ 12,757 ___________________ (1) The related tax benefits were $ 1.4 billion, $ 1.9 billion, and $ 2.7 billion for 2019, 2020, and 2021. The following table summarizes our restricted stock unit activity (in millions): Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding as of January 1, 2019 15.9 $ 1,024 Units granted 6.7 1,808 Units vested ( 6.6 ) 827 Units forfeited ( 1.7 ) 1,223 Outstanding as of December 31, 2019 14.3 1,458 Units granted 8.0 2,373 Units vested ( 5.8 ) 1,239 Units forfeited ( 1.3 ) 1,642 Outstanding as of December 31, 2020 15.2 2,004 Units granted 6.3 3,348 Units vested ( 5.4 ) 1,704 Units forfeited ( 2.1 ) 2,314 Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 14.0 2,684 Scheduled vesting for outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2021, is as follows (in millions): Year Ended 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total Scheduled vesting — restricted stock units 5.4 5.2 2.2 0.9 0.1 0.2 14.0 As of December 31, 2021, there was $ 16.6 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with approximately half of the compensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a remaining weighted-average recognition period of 1.1 years. The estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was 27 %. Changes in our estimates and assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. During 2019, 2020, and 2021, the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $ 11.7 billion, $ 15.5 billion, and $ 18.2 billion. 60 Table of Contents Common Stock Available for Future Issuance As of December 31, 2021, common stock available for future issuance to employees is 97 million shares. Note 9 — INCOME TAXES In 2019, 2020, and 2021, we recorded net tax provisions of $ 2.4 billion, $ 2.9 billion, and $ 4.8 billion. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $ 881 million, $ 1.7 billion, and $ 3.7 billion for 2019, 2020, and 2021. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2019 and a partial election for 2020 and 2021. The components of the provision for income taxes, net are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 U.S. Federal: Current $ 162 $ 1,835 $ 2,129 Deferred 914 ( 151 ) 155 Total 1,076 1,684 2,284 U.S. State: Current 276 626 763 Deferred 8 ( 190 ) ( 178 ) Total 284 436 585 International: Current 1,140 956 2,209 Deferred ( 126 ) ( 213 ) ( 287 ) Total 1,014 743 1,922 Provision for income taxes, net $ 2,374 $ 2,863 $ 4,791 U.S. and international components of income before income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 U.S. $ 13,285 $ 20,219 $ 35,879 International 691 3,959 2,272 Income before income taxes $ 13,976 $ 24,178 $ 38,151 61 Table of Contents The items accounting for differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision recorded for income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate $ 2,935 $ 5,078 $ 8,012 Effect of: Tax impact of foreign earnings and losses 453 ( 538 ) ( 1,349 ) State taxes, net of federal benefits 221 343 465 Tax credits ( 466 ) ( 639 ) ( 1,136 ) Stock-based compensation (1) ( 850 ) ( 1,107 ) ( 1,094 ) Foreign income deduction (2) ( 72 ) ( 372 ) ( 301 ) Other, net 153 98 194 Total $ 2,374 $ 2,863 $ 4,791 ___________________ (1) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $ 1.4 billion, $ 1.8 billion, and $ 1.9 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2019, 2020, and 2021. (2) U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction (“FDII”). Our provision for income taxes in 2020 was higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was partially offset by the impact of developments in our ongoing global tax controversies on taxes related to our foreign earnings and losses, an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and an increase in our foreign income deduction under FDII. In addition, our Luxembourg operations generated earnings in 2020 and utilized deferred tax assets previously subject to valuation allowances. Our provision for income taxes in 2021 was higher than in 2020 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was partially offset by an increase in U.S. federal research and development credits and the impact of the distribution of certain intangible assets from Luxembourg to the U.S. in Q4 2021, resulting in the utilization of $ 2.6 billion of Luxembourg deferred tax assets previously subject to a valuation allowance. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. 62 Table of Contents Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2020 2021 Deferred tax assets (1): Loss carryforwards U.S. - Federal/States 245 228 Loss carryforwards - Foreign 3,876 2,417 Accrued liabilities, reserves, and other expenses 2,457 2,821 Stock-based compensation 2,033 2,738 Depreciation and amortization 1,886 941 Operating lease liabilities 10,183 15,399 Other items 559 603 Tax credits 207 626 Total gross deferred tax assets 21,446 25,773 Less valuation allowances (2) ( 5,803 ) ( 3,596 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 15,643 22,177 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 5,508 ) ( 3,562 ) Operating lease assets ( 9,539 ) ( 14,422 ) Assets held for investment ( 569 ) ( 4,019 ) Other items ( 893 ) ( 668 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowances $ ( 866 ) $ ( 494 ) ___________________ (1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies. (2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2021. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $ 9.2 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2022. Tax Contingencies We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. The reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions): December 31, 2019 2020 2021 Gross tax contingencies – January 1 $ 3,414 $ 3,923 $ 2,820 Gross increases to tax positions in prior periods 216 88 403 Gross decreases to tax positions in prior periods ( 181 ) ( 465 ) ( 354 ) Gross increases to current period tax positions 707 507 507 Settlements with tax authorities ( 207 ) ( 1,207 ) ( 60 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 26 ) ( 26 ) ( 74 ) Gross tax contingencies – December 31 (1) $ 3,923 $ 2,820 $ 3,242 ___________________ (1) As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $ 3.2 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $ 1.6 billion, if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. 63 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $ 83 million and $ 110 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $ 4 million, $( 48 ) million, and $ 28 million. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We resolved the audits of tax years 2007 through 2015 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual. In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately € 250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission’s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. North America The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants On Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of December 31, 2021. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 68 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 and the related notes and our report dated February 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington February 3, 2022 69 Table of Contents Item 9B.

Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I — “Risk Factors.” Amazon.com, Inc.’s principal corporate offices are located in Seattle, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AMZN.” As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. General We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Consumers We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, and other devices, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, access to unlimited streaming of tens of thousands of movies and TV episodes, including Amazon Original content, and other benefits. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.” Sellers We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs. Developers and Enterprises We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. Content Creators We serve authors and independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. 3 Table of Contents Competition Our businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. Human Capital Our employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,298,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. We focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including industry-leading pay and benefits, skills training programs such as Amazon Career Choice and the Amazon Technical Academy, mentorship and support resources, and programs that advance engagement, communication, and feedback. Available Information Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases. 4 Table of Contents Executive Officers and Directors The following tables set forth certain information regarding our Executive Officers and Directors as of January 20, 2021: Information About Our Executive Officers Name Age Position Jeffrey P.

Risk Factors Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Business and Industry Risks We Face Intense Competition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • local economic and political conditions; • government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership; • restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; 6 Table of Contents • business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices; • limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; • limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; • shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; • laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; • lower levels of use of the Internet; • lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; • lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; • difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; • different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; • compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; • laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and • geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth. The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. 7 Table of Contents The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand. We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. 8 Table of Contents Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service. We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa. Operating Risks Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following: • our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands; • our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; • our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; • the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; • changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; • timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; • the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; • the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth; • the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; • variations in the mix of products and services we sell; • variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; • the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; • factors affecting our reputation or brand image; • the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; 9 Table of Contents • increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products; • the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; • our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; • the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings; • the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and • disruptions from natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade disputes, and similar events. We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition, failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. The inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events. We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches Because we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented. We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results. 10 Table of Contents Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • impairment of other relationships; • variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and • difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. 11 Table of Contents Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • problems retaining key personnel; • additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; • the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions; • the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations; • the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; • the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; • the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented; • losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our financial results; • for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes; • the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company; • the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face; • potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and • for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results. We Face Significant Inventory Risk In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results. We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication 12 Table of Contents processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services. We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as: • changes in interest rates; • conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in; • quarterly variations in operating results; • fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular; • changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels; • changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; • changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; • changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and • transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both. Legal and Regulatory Risks Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial 13 Table of Contents intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, a number of regulators have opened investigations to assess whether aspects of our operations violate competition rules. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data protection, data security, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations. We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. 14 Table of Contents We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date. Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities. We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle 1 . On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales 1 The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 19 Table of Contents by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users’ experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services, to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 512 million and 518 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Effects of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have affected our businesses, as well as those of our customers, suppliers, and third-party sellers. To serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have modified numerous aspects of our logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and third-party seller processes. Beginning in Q1 2020, we made numerous process updates across our operations worldwide, and adapted our fulfillment network, to implement employee and customer safety measures, such as enhanced cleaning and physical distancing, personal protective gear, disinfectant spraying, and temperature checks. Since February 2020, we have hired over 400,000 full-time and part-time employees to increase our fulfillment network capacity. We incurred approximately $4.0 billion in COVID-19 related costs in Q4 2020, for a total of more than $11.5 billion during 2020. We will continue to prioritize employee and customer safety and comply with evolving federal, state, and local standards as well as to implement standards or processes that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities. 20 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $270 million. In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 21 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Investing activities (24,281) (59,611) Financing activities (10,066) (1,104) Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $55.0 billion and $84.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $15.3 billion and $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $38.5 billion and $66.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2020, compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(24.3) billion and $(59.6) billion in 2019 and 2020, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $12.7 billion, and $35.0 billion in 2019 and 2020, which primarily reflect investments in additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), which investments we expect to continue over time. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion in 2019 and 2020. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(10.1) billion and $(1.1) billion in 2019 and 2020. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds of short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $2.3 billion and $17.3 billion in 2019 and 2020. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $12.3 billion and $18.4 billion in 2019 and 2020. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $13.7 billion and $11.6 billion in 2019 and 2020, reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS. We had no borrowings outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”), $725 million of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), and $338 million of borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. As of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $17.2 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income, and all remaining federal tax credits, which were primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, reduced our federal tax liability in 2020. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2018 and 2019 and a partial election for 2020. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $881 million and $1.7 billion for 2019 and 2020. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the 22 Table of Contents European Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $321 million and $257 million. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $26.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions have caused significant market volatility. These disruptions can contribute to defaults in our accounts receivable, affect asset valuations resulting in impairment charges, and affect the availability of lease and financing credit as well as other segments of the credit markets. We have utilized a range of financing methods to fund our operations and capital expenditures and expect to continue to maintain financing flexibility in the current market conditions. However, due to the rapidly evolving global situation, it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Effects of COVID-19 As reflected in the discussion below, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to it had varying effects on our 2020 results of operations. Higher net sales in the North America and International segments reflect increased demand, particularly as people are staying at home, including for household staples and other essential and home products, partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints. Other effects in the North America and International segments include increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to the impact of lower productivity, increased employee hiring and benefits, and costs to maintain safe workplaces. We expect the effects of fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints, elevated collection risk in our accounts receivable, and increased fulfillment costs and cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue into all or portions of Q1 2021. However, it is not possible to determine the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence, the actions taken in response to the pandemic, the scale and rate of economic recovery from the pandemic, any ongoing effects on consumer demand and spending patterns, or other impacts of the pandemic, and whether these or other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations. 24 Table of Contents Net Sales Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Net Sales: North America $ 170,773 $ 236,282 International 74,723 104,412 AWS 35,026 45,370 Consolidated $ 280,522 $ 386,064 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 21 % 38 % International 13 40 AWS 37 30 Consolidated 20 38 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America 21 % 38 % International 17 38 AWS 37 30 Consolidated 22 37 Net sales mix: North America 61 % 61 % International 27 27 AWS 12 12 Consolidated 100 % 100 % Sales increased 38% in 2020, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(2.6) billion and $1.4 billion for 2019 and 2020. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below. North America sales increased 38% in 2020, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, including for household staples and other essential and home products, partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints. International sales increased 40% in 2020, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, and increased demand, including for household staples and other essential and home products, partially offset by fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(2.4) billion and $1.7 billion in 2019 and 2020. AWS sales increased 30% in 2020, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 25 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Operating Income (Loss): North America $ 7,033 $ 8,651 International (1,693) 717 AWS 9,201 13,531 Consolidated $ 14,541 $ 22,899 Operating income was $14.5 billion and $22.9 billion for 2019 and 2020. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to COVID-19. We expect North America operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $23 million and $8 million for 2019 and 2020. The International operating income in 2020, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs due in part to COVID-19. We expect International operating income to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $(116) million and $411 million for 2019 and 2020. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, including a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth, and reduced prices for our customers. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $273 million and $30 million for 2019 and 2020. 26 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 165,536 $ 233,307 Fulfillment 40,232 58,517 Technology and content 35,931 42,740 Marketing 18,878 22,008 General and administrative 5,203 6,668 Other operating expense (income), net 201 (75) Total operating expenses $ 265,981 $ 363,165 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales 19 % 41 % Fulfillment 18 45 Technology and content 25 19 Marketing 37 17 General and administrative 20 28 Other operating expense (income), net (32) (137) Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 59.0 % 60.4 % Fulfillment 14.3 15.2 Technology and content 12.8 11.1 Marketing 6.7 5.7 General and administrative 1.9 1.7 Other operating expense (income), net 0.1 — Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. We expect cost of sales as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $37.9 billion and $61.1 billion in 2019 and 2020. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. 27 Table of Contents Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels, costs from expanding our fulfillment network, and the COVID-19 related impact of lower productivity, increased employee hiring and benefits, and costs to maintain safe workplaces. We expect fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales to continue to be negatively impacted through at least Q1 2021 by COVID-19 related costs. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings and an increase in spending on technology infrastructure, offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures — Use of Estimates” for additional information on our change in estimated useful life of our servers. Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, partially offset by lower spending on marketing channels as a result of COVID-19. While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. 28 Table of Contents General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2020, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $201 million and $(75) million during 2019 and 2020, and was primarily related to a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $832 million and $555 million during 2019 and 2020. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $1.6 billion in 2019 and 2020 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. Our long-term lease liabilities were $39.8 billion and $52.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Our long-term debt was $23.4 billion and $31.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $203 million and $2.4 billion during 2019 and 2020. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity warrant valuations, equity securities valuations and adjustments, and foreign currency. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future income more challenging. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.4 billion and $2.9 billion in 2019 and 2020. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations. 29 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (12,689) (35,044) Free cash flow $ 25,825 $ 31,020 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (24,281) $ (59,611) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (10,066) $ (1,104) Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (12,689) (35,044) Free cash flow 25,825 31,020 Principal repayments of finance leases (9,628) (10,642) Principal repayments of financing obligations (27) (53) Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations $ 16,170 $ 20,325 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (24,281) $ (59,611) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (10,066) $ (1,104) 30 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2019 and 2020 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 38,514 $ 66,064 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (12,689) (35,044) Free cash flow 25,825 31,020 Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (12,916) (9,104) Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (392) (427) Principal repayments of financing obligations (27) (53) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations $ 12,490 $ 21,436 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (24,281) $ (59,611) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (10,066) $ (1,104) ___________________ (1) For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of $13,723 million and $11,588 million. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $9,628 million and $10,642 million. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 31 Table of Contents Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2020 As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) Net sales $ 280,522 $ 2,560 $ 283,082 $ 386,064 $ (1,438) $ 384,626 Operating expenses 265,981 2,740 268,721 363,165 (989) 362,176 Operating income 14,541 (180) 14,361 22,899 (449) 22,450 ___ ________________ (1) Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.

Guidance We provided guidance on February 2, 2021, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of February 2, 2021, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 2, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the first quarter of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below. However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the first quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations. First Quarter 2021 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $100.0 billion and $106.0 billion, or to grow between 33% and 40% compared with first quarter 2020. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 300 basis points from foreign exchange rates. • Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $6.5 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in first quarter 2020. This guidance assumes approximately $2.0 billion of costs related to COVID-19. • This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. 32 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages): 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2020 Money market funds $ 27,430 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 27,430 $ 27,430 Weighted average interest rate (0.16) % — % — % — % — % — % (0.16) % Corporate debt securities 16,505 4,459 5,531 1,990 886 — 29,371 29,988 Weighted average interest rate 0.42 % 1.65 % 1.32 % 1.86 % 1.84 % 0.92 % U.S. government and agency securities 5,439 587 899 298 67 71 7,361 7,439 Weighted average interest rate 0.30 % 1.38 % 1.12 % 1.74 % 1.13 % 2.97 % 0.58 % Asset-backed securities 870 773 472 763 243 46 3,167 3,235 Weighted average interest rate 2.08 % 2.00 % 1.53 % 2.13 % 1.57 % 1.25 % 1.94 % Foreign government and agency securities 4,932 147 45 3 — — 5,127 5,131 Weighted average interest rate 0.25 % 0.74 % 1.28 % 1.76 % — % — % 0.28 % Other fixed income securities 109 156 230 160 43 — 698 710 Weighted average interest rate 2.10 % 1.85 % 1.10 % 0.84 % 1.31 % — % 1.38 % $ 55,285 $ 6,122 $ 7,177 $ 3,214 $ 1,239 $ 117 $ 73,154 Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities $ 73,933 As of December 31, 2020, we had long-term debt with a face value of $33.2 billion, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Foreign Exchange Risk During 2020, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $1.7 billion in comparison with the prior year. 33 Table of Contents We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2020, of $23.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $1.2 billion, $2.4 billion, and $4.7 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2020, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $245 million, $485 million, and $970 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates. Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2020, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $6.9 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $3.2 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2020, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We assess our equity investments in private companies for impairment. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 34 Table of Contents Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Page Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 36 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 38 Consolidated Statements of Operations 39 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 40 Consolidated Balance Sheets 41 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity 42 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 43 35 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and, as discussed in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2020, the Company accrued liabilities of $2.8 billion for various tax contingencies. Auditing the measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. 36 Table of Contents How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of, and experience with, international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the Company’s calculations. We have also evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in relation to these matters. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES Description of Business We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.” Prior Period Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Proceeds from short-term debt, and other” were reclassified from “Proceeds from long-term debt and other” and “Repayments of short-term debt, and other” were reclassified from “Repayments of long-term debt and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, and valuation and impairment of investments. Given the global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates have become more challenging, and actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2020 we changed our estimate of the useful life for our servers from three years to four years . The longer useful life is due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on servers that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $ 2.7 billion and an increase in net income of $ 2.0 billion, or $ 4.06 per basic share and $ 3.98 per diluted share. 43 Table of Contents Supplemental Cash Flow Information The following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION: Cash paid for interest on debt $ 854 $ 875 $ 916 Cash paid for operating leases $ — $ 3,361 $ 4,475 Cash paid for interest on finance leases $ 381 $ 647 $ 612 Cash paid for interest on financing obligations $ 194 $ 39 $ 102 Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds $ 1,184 $ 881 $ 1,713 Assets acquired under operating leases $ — $ 7,870 $ 16,217 Property and equipment acquired under finance leases $ 10,615 $ 13,723 $ 11,588 Property and equipment acquired under build-to-suit arrangements $ 3,641 $ 1,362 $ 2,267 Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 487 494 500 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 13 10 10 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 500 504 510 Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period. AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term. 44 Table of Contents Other - Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions. Return Allowances Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $ 623 million, $ 712 million, and $ 859 million as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Additions to the allowance were $ 2.3 billion, $ 2.5 billion, and $ 3.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $ 2.3 billion, $ 2.5 billion, and $ 3.6 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Included in “Inventories” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $ 519 million, $ 629 million, and $ 852 million as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred. Marketing Marketing costs primarily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties. Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $ 8.2 billion, $ 11.0 billion, and $ 10.9 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020. 45 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and litigation costs. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of a benefit from accelerated vesting of warrants to acquire equity of a vendor in Q4 2020, offset by a lease impairment in Q2 2020 and the amortization of intangible assets. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of valuations and adjustments of equity securities of $ 145 million, $ 231 million, and $ 833 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020, equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $( 131 ) million, $ 11 million, and $ 1.5 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and foreign currency gains (losses) of $( 206 ) million, $( 20 ) million, and $ 35 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020. During the period from January 1, 2021 to February 2, 2021, we expect to record upward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies of approximately $ 1.5 billion. In addition, for this same period, our equity and equity warrant investments in public companies, which are subject to volatility based on changes in market prices, have experienced gains of approximately $ 1.5 billion based on available trading prices. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future earnings in relevant jurisdictions more challenging. We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. 46 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, these warrants had a fair value of $ 669 million and $ 3.0 billion, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $ 1.6 billion and $ 2.3 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories. We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, customer receivables, net, were $ 12.6 billion and $ 14.8 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $ 4.2 billion and $ 4.8 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $ 863 million and $ 381 million. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 495 million, $ 718 million, and $ 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Additions to the allowance were $ 878 million, $ 1.0 billion, and $ 1.4 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $ 731 million, $ 793 million, and $ 1.0 billion in 2018, 2019, and 2020. 47 Table of Contents Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years prior to January 1, 2020 and four years subsequent to January 1, 2020 for our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. Leases We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property. Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone prices. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term. When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. Financing Obligations We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation. If we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as either operating or finance. 48 Table of Contents Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. We completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2020, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.” Other Assets Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; certain equity investments; equity warrant assets; long-term deferred tax assets; and lease prepayments made prior to lease commencement. Digital Video and Music Content We obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.5 years. Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 were $ 5.8 billion and $ 6.8 billion. Total video and music expense was $ 7.8 billion and $ 11.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2020. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, these investments had a carrying value of $ 1.5 billion and $ 2.7 billion. 49 Table of Contents Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in “Equity - method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Accrued Expenses and Other Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, payroll and related expenses, tax-related liabilities, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $ 4.3 billion and $ 7.6 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $ 3.3 billion and $ 4.7 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $ 10.2 billion, of which $ 7.9 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $ 11.6 billion. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.9 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $ 50.0 billion as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.4 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. Other Long-Term Liabilities Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, deferred tax liabilities, unearned revenue, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content. Foreign Currency We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates 50 Table of Contents prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $( 186 ) million, $ 95 million, and $ 118 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and other investment grade securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. The following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions): December 31, 2019 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 9,776 $ — $ — $ 9,776 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 18,850 — — 18,850 Equity securities 202 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 4,794 — — 4,794 U.S. government and agency securities 7,070 11 ( 1 ) 7,080 Corporate debt securities 11,845 37 ( 1 ) 11,881 Asset-backed securities 2,355 6 ( 1 ) 2,360 Other fixed income securities 393 1 — 394 Equity securities 5 $ 55,083 $ 55 $ ( 3 ) $ 55,342 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2) ( 321 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 55,021 51 Table of Contents December 31, 2020 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 10,063 $ — $ — $ 10,063 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 27,430 — — 27,430 Equity securities (1) 617 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 5,130 1 — 5,131 U.S. government and agency securities 7,410 30 ( 1 ) 7,439 Corporate debt securities 29,684 305 ( 1 ) 29,988 Asset-backed securities 3,206 32 ( 3 ) 3,235 Other fixed income securities 701 9 — 710 Equity securities (1) 40 $ 83,624 $ 377 $ ( 5 ) $ 84,653 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2) ( 257 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 84,396 ___________________ (1) The related unrealized gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $ 448 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. (2) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as “Accounts receivable, net and other” and of twelve months or longer as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies.” The following table summarizes gross gains and gross losses realized on sales of available-for-sale fixed income marketable securities (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Realized gains $ 2 $ 11 $ 92 Realized losses 9 7 56 The following table summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities as of December 31, 2020 (in millions): Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value Due within one year $ 52,838 $ 52,850 Due after one year through five years 17,222 17,546 Due after five years through ten years 857 863 Due after ten years 2,644 2,674 Total $ 73,561 $ 73,933 Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have certain prepayment conditions. 52 Table of Contents Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Reconciliation The following table provides a reconciliation of the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions): December 31, 2019 December 31, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 36,092 $ 42,122 Restricted cash included in accounts receivable, net and other 276 233 Restricted cash included in other assets 42 22 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 36,410 $ 42,377 Note 3 — PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment, at cost, consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, 2019 2020 Gross property and equipment (1): Land and buildings $ 39,223 $ 57,324 Equipment 71,310 97,224 Other assets 3,111 3,772 Construction in progress 6,036 15,228 Gross property and equipment 119,680 173,548 Total accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 46,975 60,434 Total property and equipment, net $ 72,705 $ 113,114 __________________ (1) Includes the original cost and accumulated depreciation of fully-depreciated assets. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $ 12.1 billion, $ 15.1 billion, and $ 16.2 billion which includes amortization of property and equipment acquired under finance leases of $ 7.3 billion, $ 10.1 billion, and $ 8.5 billion for 2018, 2019, and 2020. Note 4 — LEASES Gross assets acquired under finance leases, inclusive of those where title transfers at the end of the lease, are recorded in “Property and equipment, net” and were $ 57.4 billion and $ 68.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Accumulated amortization associated with finance leases was $ 30.0 billion and $ 36.5 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.

During 2018, we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $ 57 million. 2019 Acquisition Activity During 2019, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $ 315 million, net of cash acquired. 2020 Acquisition Activity During 2020, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $ 1.2 billion, net of cash acquired, of which $ 1.1 billion was capitalized to in-process research and development intangible assets (“IPR&D”). The primary reason for all acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of 2020 acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. 54 Table of Contents Goodwill The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax purposes. The following summarizes our goodwill activity in 2019 and 2020 by segment (in millions): North America International AWS Consolidated Goodwill - January 1, 2019 $ 12,191 $ 1,270 $ 1,087 $ 14,548 New acquisitions 71 29 89 189 Other adjustments (1) 2 1 14 17 Goodwill - December 31, 2019 12,264 1,300 1,190 14,754 New acquisitions 204 6 2 212 Other adjustments (1) 59 ( 18 ) 10 51 Goodwill - December 31, 2020 $ 12,527 $ 1,288 $ 1,202 $ 15,017 ___________________ (1) Primarily includes changes in foreign exchange rates.

(2) Finite-lived intangible assets have estimated useful lives of between one and twenty-five years , and are being amortized to operating expenses on a straight-line basis. (3) Intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are in-process and used in research and development activities are considered indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the research and development efforts. Once the research and development efforts are completed, we determine the useful life and begin amortizing the assets . 55 Table of Contents Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangibles was $ 475 million, $ 565 million, and $ 509 million in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Expected future amortization expense of acquired finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 $ 464 2022 430 2023 368 2024 303 2025 251 Thereafter 2,022 $ 3,838 Note 6 — DEBT As of December 31, 2020, we had $ 32.2 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (the “Notes”), including $ 10.0 billion issued in June 2020 for general corporate purposes. We also have other long-term debt and borrowings under our credit facility of $ 1.6 billion and $ 924 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Our total long-term debt obligations are as follows (in millions): Maturities (1) Stated Interest Rates Effective Interest Rates December 31, 2019 December 31, 2020 2012 Notes issuance of $ 3.0 billion 2022 2.50 % 2.66 % 1,250 1,250 2014 Notes issuance of $ 6.0 billion 2021 - 2044 3.30 % - 4.95 % 3.43 % - 5.11 % 5,000 5,000 2017 Notes issuance of $ 17.0 billion 2023 - 2057 2.40 % - 5.20 % 2.56 % - 4.33 % 17,000 16,000 2020 Notes issuance of $ 10.0 billion 2023 - 2060 0.40 % - 2.70 % 0.56 % - 2.77 % — 10,000 Credit Facility 740 338 Other long-term debt 830 586 Total face value of long-term debt 24,820 33,174 Unamortized discount and issuance costs, net ( 101 ) ( 203 ) Less current portion of long-term debt ( 1,305 ) ( 1,155 ) Long-term debt $ 23,414 $ 31,816 ___________________ (1) The weighted average remaining lives of the 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2020 Notes were 1.9 , 11.8 , 16.2 , and 18.7 years as of December 31, 2020. The combined weighted average remaining life of the Notes was 15.8 years as of December 31, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $ 26.2 billion and $ 37.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In October 2016, we entered into a $ 500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we subsequently increased to $ 740 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until October 2022, bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.40 %, and has a commitment fee of 0.50 % on the undrawn portion. There were $ 740 million and $ 338 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, which had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.4 % and 3.0 %, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we have pledged $ 852 million and $ 398 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. Other long-term debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.1 % and 2.9 % as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain business operations. The estimated fair value of other long-term debt, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. 56 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2020, future principal payments for our total long-term debt were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 $ 1,156 2022 1,629 2023 2,283 2024 3,355 2025 2,251 Thereafter 22,500 $ 33,174 In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $ 7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. In June 2020, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Program to $ 10.0 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2019. There were $ 725 million of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2020, which are included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and have a weighted average effective interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.11 %. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes. In April 2018, in connection with our Commercial Paper Program, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders to increase our borrowing capacity thereunder to $ 7.0 billion. In June 2020, we further amended and restated the Credit Agreement to extend the term to June 2023, and it may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the amended and restated Credit Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.50 %, with a commitment fee of 0.04 % on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2020. We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. These amounts are included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $ 5.1 billion of unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2020. 57 Table of Contents Note 7 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We have entered into non-cancellable operating and finance leases and financing obligations for equipment and office, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, data center, physical store, and renewable energy facilities. The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments, excluding open orders for purchases that support normal operations and are generally cancellable, as of December 31, 2020 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Long-term debt principal and interest $ 2,187 $ 2,622 $ 3,219 $ 4,272 $ 3,058 $ 35,680 $ 51,038 Operating lease liabilities 5,600 5,184 4,743 4,356 3,951 22,330 46,164 Finance lease liabilities, including interest 10,778 7,246 3,456 1,389 1,035 6,533 30,437 Financing obligations, including interest 227 230 233 237 240 3,751 4,918 Leases not yet commenced 1,010 1,738 1,876 1,973 1,951 20,321 28,869 Unconditional purchase obligations (1) 3,869 3,760 3,367 3,141 2,213 136 16,486 Other commitments (2)(3) 3,671 2,386 945 783 661 8,351 16,797 Total commitments $ 27,342 $ 23,166 $ 17,839 $ 16,151 $ 13,109 $ 97,102 $ 194,709 ___________________ (1) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores and long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (2) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction, asset retirement obligations, and liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year. (3) Excludes approximately $ 2.8 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any. Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we have pledged or otherwise restricted $ 994 million and $ 875 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller receivables for debt related to our Credit Facility. See “Note 6 — Debt.” Suppliers During 2020, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-party sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and we have appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If other tax authorities were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. 58 Table of Contents Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Web Services, LLC for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual Private Cloud, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto-Scaling, and Elastic Beanstalk infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,484,257, entitled “System and Method for Maintaining N Number of Simultaneous Cryptographic Sessions Using a Distributed Computing Environment.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. In June 2016, the case was stayed pending resolution of a review petition we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In January 2019, the stay of the case was lifted following resolution of the review petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects Within A Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’ fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $ 130 -$ 250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled “Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol,” and 7,233,978, entitled “Method And Apparatus For Managing Location Information In A Network Separate From The Data To Which The Location Information Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Beginning in March 2020, a number of class-action complaints were filed alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and third-party sellers in Amazon’s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization of an alleged market in online retail or other submarkets, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. In March 2020, Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Beginning in April 2020, class action complaints were filed in the Superior Court of Quebec – Division of Montreal, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, and the Federal Court of Canada against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities. The complaints allege several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged actual damages, treble damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In November 2020, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that Amazon uses data relating to our marketplace sellers in a manner that infringes EU competition rules. The Statement of Objections seeks to impose unspecified fines and remedial actions. We disagree with the preliminary assertions of the European Commission and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular 59 Table of Contents basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See also “Note 9 — Income Taxes.” Note 8 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock We have authorized 500 million shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock. No preferred stock was outstanding for any year presented. Common Stock Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 507 million, 512 million, and 518 million, as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. Stock Repurchase Activity In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $ 5.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2018, 2019, or 2020. Stock Award Plans Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years . Stock Award Activity Stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Cost of sales $ 73 $ 149 $ 283 Fulfillment 1,121 1,182 1,357 Technology and content 2,888 3,725 5,061 Marketing 769 1,135 1,710 General and administrative 567 673 797 Total stock-based compensation expense (1) $ 5,418 $ 6,864 $ 9,208 ___________________ (1) The related tax benefits were $ 1.1 billion, $ 1.4 billion, and $ 1.9 billion for 2018, 2019, and 2020. 60 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our restricted stock unit activity (in millions): Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding as of January 1, 2018 20.1 $ 725 Units granted 5.0 1,522 Units vested ( 7.1 ) 578 Units forfeited ( 2.1 ) 862 Outstanding as of December 31, 2018 15.9 1,024 Units granted 6.7 1,808 Units vested ( 6.6 ) 827 Units forfeited ( 1.7 ) 1,223 Outstanding as of December 31, 2019 14.3 1,458 Units granted 8.0 2,373 Units vested ( 5.8 ) 1,239 Units forfeited ( 1.3 ) 1,642 Outstanding as of December 31, 2020 15.2 2,004 Scheduled vesting for outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2020, is as follows (in millions): Year Ended 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Scheduled vesting — restricted stock units 5.7 5.4 2.7 1.2 0.1 0.1 15.2 As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 13.3 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with approximately half of the compensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a remaining weighted-average recognition period of 1.2 years. The estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020 was 27 %. Changes in our estimates and assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. During 2018, 2019, and 2020, the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $ 11.4 billion, $ 11.7 billion, and $ 15.5 billion. Common Stock Available for Future Issuance As of December 31, 2020, common stock available for future issuance to employees is 102 million shares. Note 9 — INCOME TAXES In 2018, 2019, and 2020, we recorded net tax provisions of $ 1.2 billion, $ 2.4 billion, and $ 2.9 billion. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $ 1.2 billion, $ 881 million, and $ 1.7 billion for 2018, 2019, and 2020. U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction (“FDII”). In addition, certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing the election of full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Our federal tax provision included the election of full expensing of qualified property for 2018 and 2019 and a partial election for 2020. 61 Table of Contents The components of the provision for income taxes, net are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 U.S. Federal: Current $ ( 129 ) $ 162 $ 1,835 Deferred 565 914 ( 151 ) Total 436 1,076 1,684 U.S. State: Current 322 276 626 Deferred 5 8 ( 190 ) Total 327 284 436 International: Current 563 1,140 956 Deferred ( 129 ) ( 126 ) ( 213 ) Total 434 1,014 743 Provision for income taxes, net $ 1,197 $ 2,374 $ 2,863 U.S. and international components of income before income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 U.S. $ 11,157 $ 13,285 $ 20,219 International 104 691 3,959 Income before income taxes $ 11,261 $ 13,976 $ 24,178 The items accounting for differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision recorded for income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate $ 2,365 $ 2,935 $ 5,078 Effect of: Tax impact of foreign earnings and losses 162 453 ( 538 ) State taxes, net of federal benefits 263 221 343 Tax credits ( 419 ) ( 466 ) ( 639 ) Stock-based compensation (1) ( 1,086 ) ( 850 ) ( 1,107 ) Foreign income deduction (FDII) ( 43 ) ( 72 ) ( 372 ) 2017 Impact of U.S. Tax Act ( 157 ) — — Other, net 112 153 98 Total $ 1,197 $ 2,374 $ 2,863 ___________________ (1) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $ 1.6 billion, $ 1.4 billion, and $ 1.8 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2018, 2019, and 2020. Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018. Our provision for income taxes in 2020 was higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in pretax income. This was partially offset by the impact of developments in our ongoing global tax controversies on taxes related to our foreign earnings and losses, an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and an increase in our foreign income deduction under FDII. In addition, our Luxembourg operations generated earnings in 2020 and utilized deferred tax assets previously subject to valuation allowances. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. 62 Table of Contents Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2019 2020 Deferred tax assets (1): Loss carryforwards U.S. - Federal/States 188 245 Loss carryforwards - Foreign 3,232 3,876 Accrued liabilities, reserves, and other expenses 1,373 2,457 Stock-based compensation 1,585 2,033 Depreciation and amortization 2,385 1,886 Operating lease liabilities 6,648 10,183 Other items 728 559 Tax credits 772 207 Total gross deferred tax assets 16,911 21,446 Less valuation allowances (2) ( 5,754 ) ( 5,803 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 11,157 15,643 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 5,507 ) ( 5,508 ) Operating lease assets ( 6,331 ) ( 9,539 ) Other items ( 640 ) ( 1,462 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowances $ ( 1,321 ) $ ( 866 ) ___________________ (1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies. (2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2020. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $ 13.4 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2021. All remaining federal tax credits, which were primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit, reduced our federal tax liability in 2020. We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business make estimates of future earnings more challenging. Since Q2 2017, we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. There is still significant uncertainty whether our earnings in Luxembourg are sustainable in the future and we will maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a release of the valuation allowance. Tax Contingencies We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. 63 Table of Contents The reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions): December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Gross tax contingencies – January 1 $ 2,309 $ 3,414 $ 3,923 Gross increases to tax positions in prior periods 164 216 88 Gross decreases to tax positions in prior periods ( 90 ) ( 181 ) ( 465 ) Gross increases to current period tax positions 1,088 707 507 Settlements with tax authorities ( 36 ) ( 207 ) ( 1,207 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 21 ) ( 26 ) ( 26 ) Gross tax contingencies – December 31 (1) $ 3,414 $ 3,923 $ 2,820 ___________________ (1) As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $ 2.8 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $ 1.5 billion, if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. The decrease in our tax contingencies in 2020 was primarily a result of developments in our global tax controversies. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $ 131 million and $ 83 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020 was $ 20 million, $ 4 million, and $( 48 ) million. We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2013 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. During Q3 2020, we resolved the audits of tax years 2007 through 2012 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual. In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately € 250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. 64 Table of Contents North America The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions. Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 North America Net sales $ 141,366 $ 170,773 $ 236,282 Operating expenses 134,099 163,740 227,631 Operating income $ 7,267 $ 7,033 $ 8,651 International Net sales $ 65,866 $ 74,723 $ 104,412 Operating expenses 68,008 76,416 103,695 Operating income (loss) $ ( 2,142 ) $ ( 1,693 ) $ 717 AWS Net sales $ 25,655 $ 35,026 $ 45,370 Operating expenses 18,359 25,825 31,839 Operating income $ 7,296 $ 9,201 $ 13,531 Consolidated Net sales $ 232,887 $ 280,522 $ 386,064 Operating expenses 220,466 265,981 363,165 Operating income 12,421 14,541 22,899 Total non-operating income (expense) ( 1,160 ) ( 565 ) 1,279 Provision for income taxes ( 1,197 ) ( 2,374 ) ( 2,863 ) Equity-method investment activity, net of tax 9 ( 14 ) 16 Net income $ 10,073 $ 11,588 $ 21,331 65 Table of Contents Net sales by groups of similar products and services, which also have similar economic characteristics, is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 2020 Net Sales: Online stores (1) $ 122,987 $ 141,247 $ 197,346 Physical stores (2) 17,224 17,192 16,227 Third-party seller services (3) 42,745 53,762 80,461 Subscription services (4) 14,168 19,210 25,207 AWS 25,655 35,026 45,370 Other (5) 10,108 14,085 21,453 Consolidated $ 232,887 $ 280,522 $ 386,064 ___________________ (1) Includes product sales and digital media content where we record revenue gross.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants On Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of December 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 69 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes and our report dated February 2, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington February 2, 2021 70 Table of Contents Item 9B.

Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I — “Risk Factors.” Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate offices are located in Seattle, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AMZN.” As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. General We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, and authors, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017. Consumers We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, and other devices, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, access to unlimited streaming of tens of thousands of movies and TV episodes, including Amazon Original content, and other benefits. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.” Sellers We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs. Developers and Enterprises We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. 3 Table of Contents Content Creators We serve authors and independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. Competition Our businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory, and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; and (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. We recognized 34% , 31% , and 31% of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . Fourth quarter 2017 results include revenue attributable to Whole Foods Market, which we acquired on August 28, 2017. Employees We employed approximately 798,000 full-time and part-time employees as of December 31, 2019 . However, employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils, statutory employee representation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of our studio operations within the United States. We consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. 4 Table of Contents Available Information Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Risk Factors Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. We Face Intense Competition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following: • our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands; 6 Table of Contents • our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; • our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; • the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; • changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; • timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; • the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; • the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth; • the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; • variations in the mix of products and services we sell; • variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; • the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; • factors affecting our reputation or brand image; • the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; • increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products; • the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; • our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; • the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and • disruptions from natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade disputes, and similar events. Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • local economic and political conditions; • government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership; • restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; • business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices; • limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; • limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; • shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; • laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; 7 Table of Contents • lower levels of use of the Internet; • lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; • lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; • difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; • different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; • compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; • laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and • geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth. The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers Failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition, failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. The inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events. 8 Table of Contents The Seasonality of Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations We expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand. We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • impairment of other relationships; • variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and • difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • problems retaining key personnel; • additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; • the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions; 9 Table of Contents • the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations; • the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; • the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; • the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented; • losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our financial results; • for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes; • the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company; • the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face; • potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and • for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results. We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa. The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches Because we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products, and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation, regulatory action (including under privacy or data protection laws), and potential liability for us, deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services, and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, 10 Table of Contents although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented. We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results. Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. We Face Significant Inventory Risk In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results. We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. 11 Table of Contents Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service. We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as: • changes in interest rates; • conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in; • quarterly variations in operating results; • fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular; • changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels; • changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; • changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; • changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and • transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both. Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, data protection, and personal privacy apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, the European Commission announced that it has opened an investigation to assess whether aspects of our operations with marketplace sellers violate EU competition rules. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people. Any of these types of 12 Table of Contents proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations. We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date. Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, the legislation known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”) requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made. We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual 13 Table of Contents terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as when these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services. We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling 14 Table of Contents goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment and delivery networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. _______________________ (1) See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. (2) Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. 19 Table of Contents Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle 3 . On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the advances of wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 507 million and 512 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 . Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” _______________________ (3) The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 20 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019 , we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $230 million . In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the U.S. tax reform legislation commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 21 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 30,723 $ 38,514 Investing activities (12,369 ) (24,281 ) Financing activities (7,686 ) (10,066 ) Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $41.3 billion and $55.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were $13.8 billion and $15.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $30.7 billion and $38.5 billion in 2018 and 2019 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2019 , compared to the prior year, is primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(12.4) billion and $(24.3) billion in 2018 and 2019 , with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $11.3 billion , and $12.7 billion in 2018 and 2019 , which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS). We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion in 2018 and 2019 . Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(7.7) billion and $(10.1) billion in 2018 and 2019 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations and repayments of long-term debt and other, and were $8.5 billion and $12.3 billion in 2018 and 2019 . Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $10.6 billion and $13.7 billion in 2018 and 2019 , with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time. We had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) or unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $740 million of borrowings outstanding under our $740 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2019 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. In 2018 and 2019 , we recorded net tax provisions of $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion . Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign 22 Table of Contents subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As of December 31, 2019 , cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $13.4 billion . Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.2 billion and $881 million for 2018 and 2019 . As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $1.7 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million , that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” and “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $426 million and $321 million . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $15.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 . These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Net Sales Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, Amazon Prime membership fees, advertising services, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 Net Sales: North America $ 141,366 $ 170,773 International 65,866 74,723 AWS 25,655 35,026 Consolidated $ 232,887 $ 280,522 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 33 % 21 % International 21 13 AWS 47 37 Consolidated 31 20 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America 33 % 21 % International 19 17 AWS 47 37 Consolidated 30 22 Net sales mix: North America 61 % 61 % International 28 27 AWS 11 12 Consolidated 100 % 100 % Sales increased 20% in 2019 , compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $1.3 billion and $(2.6) billion for 2018 and 2019 . For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below. North America sales increased 21% in 2019 , compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. International sales increased 13% in 2019 , compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $1.3 billion and $(2.4) billion in 2018 and 2019 . AWS sales increased 37 % in 2019 , compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 24 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 Operating Income (Loss): North America $ 7,267 $ 7,033 International (2,142 ) (1,693 ) AWS 7,296 9,201 Consolidated $ 12,421 $ 14,541 Operating income was $12.4 billion and $14.5 billion for 2018 and 2019 . We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The decrease in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping costs and marketing expense, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $17 million and $23 million for 2018 and 2019 . The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased marketing expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $258 million and $(116) million for 2018 and 2019 . The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $(49) million and $273 million for 2018 and 2019 . 25 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 139,156 $ 165,536 Fulfillment 34,027 40,232 Technology and content 28,837 35,931 Marketing 13,814 18,878 General and administrative 4,336 5,203 Other operating expense (income), net 296 201 Total operating expenses $ 220,466 $ 265,981 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales 24 % 19 % Fulfillment 35 18 Technology and content 27 25 Marketing 37 37 General and administrative 18 20 Other operating expense (income), net 38 (32 ) Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 59.8 % 59.0 % Fulfillment 14.6 14.3 Technology and content 12.4 12.8 Marketing 5.9 6.7 General and administrative 1.9 1.9 Other operating expense (income), net 0.1 0.1 Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $27.7 billion and $37.9 billion in 2018 and 2019 . We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. 26 Table of Contents Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing costs as a percent of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2020 due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers, which will impact each of our segments. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful life of our servers. Marketing Marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased spending on marketing channels, as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. 27 Table of Contents General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2019 , compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net was $296 million and $201 million during 2018 and 2019 , and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $440 million and $832 million during 2018 and 2019 . We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2018 and 2019 . The increase is primarily related to finance leases. Our long-term lease liabilities were $9.7 billion and $39.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 . Our long-term debt was $23.5 billion and $23.4 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $(183) million and $203 million during 2018 and 2019 . The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities and warrant valuations and foreign currency. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2018 and 2019 . Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $1.7 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations. We adopted new lease accounting guidance on January 1, 2019 without retrospectively adjusting prior periods. As a result, the line items used in our calculation of measures of free cash flows have changed. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” 28 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2018 and 2019 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 30,723 $ 38,514 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (11,323 ) (12,689 ) Free cash flow $ 19,400 $ 25,825 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (12,369 ) $ (24,281 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (7,686 ) $ (10,066 ) Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2018 and 2019 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 30,723 $ 38,514 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (11,323 ) (12,689 ) Free cash flow 19,400 25,825 Principal repayments of finance leases (1) (7,449 ) (9,628 ) Principal repayments of financing obligations (1) (337 ) (27 ) Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations $ 11,614 $ 16,170 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (12,369 ) $ (24,281 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (7,686 ) $ (10,066 ) _______________ (1) Amounts for 2018 have not been retrospectively adjusted. 29 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2018 and 2019 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2019 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 30,723 $ 38,514 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (11,323 ) (12,689 ) Free cash flow 19,400 25,825 Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (10,615 ) (12,916 ) Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) — (392 ) Principal repayments of financing obligations (337 ) (27 ) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations $ 8,448 $ 12,490 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (12,369 ) $ (24,281 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (7,686 ) $ (10,066 ) ___________________ (1) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 , this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of $13,723 million . Amounts for 2018 have not been retrospectively adjusted. (2) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 , this amount relates to property included in “Principal repayments of finance leases” of $9,628 million . Amounts for 2018 have not been retrospectively adjusted. All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 30 Table of Contents Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2019 As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) Net sales $ 232,887 $ (1,253 ) $ 231,634 $ 280,522 $ 2,560 $ 283,082 Operating expenses 220,466 (1,027 ) 219,439 265,981 2,740 268,721 Operating income 12,421 (226 ) 12,195 14,541 (180 ) 14,361 ___ ________________ (1) Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.

Guidance We provided guidance on January 30, 2020 , in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 30, 2020 , and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” First Quarter 2020 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $69.0 billion and $73.0 billion, or to grow between 16% and 22% compared with first quarter 2019. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 5 basis points from foreign exchange rates. • Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in first quarter 2019. This guidance includes approximately $800 million lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2020. • This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. 31 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk During 2019 , net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $2.4 billion in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2019 , of $15.3 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $765 million , $1.5 billion , and $3.1 billion . Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2019 , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $195 million , $385 million , and $775 million , recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates. Equity Investment Risk As of December 31, 2019 , our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $3.3 billion . Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $679 million of our investments as of December 31, 2019 , and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment to fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 33 Table of Contents Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Page Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 35 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 37 Consolidated Statements of Operations 38 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 39 Consolidated Balance Sheets 40 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity 41 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 42 34 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 30, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Adoption of New Accounting Standard As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method for accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and, as discussed in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2019, the Company accrued liabilities of $3.9 billion for various tax contingencies. Auditing the measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. 35 Table of Contents How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of, and experience with, international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company’s positions. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the Company’s calculations. We have also evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in relation to these matters. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, and authors, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.” Prior Period Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the reclassification of long-term capital lease obligations that existed at December 31, 2018 from “Other long-term liabilities” to “Long-term lease liabilities” within the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. See “Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted.” Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. For example, in Q4 2019 we completed a useful life study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from three years to four years for servers in January 2020, which, based on servers that are included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019, will have an anticipated impact to our 2020 operating income of $ 2.3 billion . Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. 42 Table of Contents The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2017 2018 2019 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 480 487 494 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 13 13 10 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 493 500 504 Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks, digital video, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period. AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term. Other - Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions. Return Allowances Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $ 468 million , $ 623 million , and $ 712 million as of December 31, 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . Additions to the allowance were $ 1.8 billion , $ 2.3 billion , and $ 2.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $ 1.9 billion , $ 2.3 billion , and $ 2.5 billion in 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . Included in “Inventories” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $ 406 million , $ 519 million , and $ 629 million as of December 31, 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 , for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations. 43 Table of Contents Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred. Marketing Marketing costs primarily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties. Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $ 6.3 billion , $ 8.2 billion , and $ 11.0 billion in 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and litigation costs. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, and expenses related to legal settlements. 44 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of adjustments to and gains on equity securities of $ 18 million , $ 145 million , and $ 231 million in 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 , equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $ 109 million , $( 131 ) million , and $ 11 million in 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 , and foreign currency gains (losses) of $ 247 million , $( 206 ) million , and $( 20 ) million in 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. For our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 . We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , these warrants had a fair value of $ 440 million and $ 669 million , and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. These assets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. 45 Table of Contents Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories. We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , customer receivables, net, were $ 9.4 billion and $ 12.6 billion , vendor receivables, net, were $ 3.2 billion and $ 4.2 billion , and seller receivables, net, were $ 710 million and $ 863 million . Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. We estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 348 million , $ 495 million , and $ 718 million as of December 31, 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . Additions to the allowance were $ 626 million , $ 878 million , and $ 1.0 billion , and deductions to the allowance were $ 515 million , $ 731 million , and $ 793 million in 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction in our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years for our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. Leases We categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment, net. All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property. Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone prices. 46 Table of Contents Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term. When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. Financing Obligations We record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation. If we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as either operating or finance. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2019 , and determined that goodwill is no t impaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.” Other Assets Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; lease prepayments made prior to lease commencement; and equity warrant assets. Digital Video and Music Content We obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we 47 Table of Contents amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.7 years . Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 were $ 3.8 billion and $ 5.8 billion . Total video and music expense was $ 6.7 billion and $ 7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 . Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity - method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, these investments had a carrying value of $ 282 million and $ 1.5 billion . Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statement of operations. We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment. For debt securities and equity-method investments, we also evaluate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include: quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of the decline in value; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 . 48 Table of Contents Accrued Expenses and Other Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $ 3.4 billion and $ 4.3 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $ 2.8 billion and $ 3.3 billion . We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018 was $ 7.9 billion , of which $ 6.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $ 10.2 billion . Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $ 1.4 billion and $ 2.0 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 . Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $ 29.8 billion as of December 31, 2019 . The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years . However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. Other Long-Term Liabilities Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax liabilities, financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content. Foreign Currency We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $ 202 million , $( 186 ) million , and $ 95 million in 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and increased retained earnings by approximately $ 650 million . The adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards, which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote. We changed the recognition and classification of Amazon Prime memberships, which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the membership period as service sales. Previously, Prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product sales and service sales. Other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services are now classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis. Prior year amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy. The impact of applying this ASU for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service sales driven by the reclassification of Prime membership fees of approximately $ 3.8 billion . Service sales also increased by approximately $ 3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the reclassification of certain advertising services. 49 Table of Contents In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Under this ASU, certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases, primarily requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the new guidance, leases previously described as capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations, respectively. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 by recording an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately $ 21 billion , which included the reclassification of finance lease obligations to operating leases of $ 1.2 billion . As of December 31, 2018, amounts related to finance lease obligations and construction liabilities totaled $ 9.6 billion , of which $ 1.5 billion was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and $ 5.4 billion and $ 1.5 billion were reclassified to finance leases and operating leases, respectively. In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $ 250 million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances. In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2017 Previously Reported Adjustments As Revised Operating activities $ 18,434 $ ( 69 ) $ 18,365 Investing activities ( 27,819 ) 735 ( 27,084 ) Financing activities 9,860 68 9,928 Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 475 $ 734 $ 1,209 In March 2019, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for film costs, inclusive of episodic television and movie costs. The new guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of the production costs related to our produced episodic television content. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2019 and began capitalizing substantially all of our production costs. Adoption of this ASU resulted in approximately $ 1.0 billion of incremental capitalized film costs classified in “Other Assets” as of December 31, 2019 . 50 Table of Contents Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities As of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and other investment grade securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. The following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions): December 31, 2018 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 10,406 $ — $ — $ 10,406 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 12,515 — — 12,515 Equity securities 170 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 815 — — 815 U.S. government and agency securities 11,686 1 ( 20 ) 11,667 Corporate debt securities 5,008 1 ( 19 ) 4,990 Asset-backed securities 896 — ( 4 ) 892 Other fixed income securities 190 — ( 2 ) 188 Equity securities 33 $ 41,516 $ 2 $ ( 45 ) $ 41,676 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2) ( 426 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 41,250 51 Table of Contents December 31, 2019 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 9,776 $ — $ — $ 9,776 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 18,850 — — 18,850 Equity securities (1) 202 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 4,794 — — 4,794 U.S. government and agency securities 7,070 11 ( 1 ) 7,080 Corporate debt securities 11,845 37 ( 1 ) 11,881 Asset-backed securities 2,355 6 ( 1 ) 2,360 Other fixed income securities 393 1 — 394 Equity securities (1) 5 $ 55,083 $ 55 $ ( 3 ) $ 55,342 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (2) ( 321 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 55,021 ___________________ (1) The related unrealized gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $ 4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 . (2) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit.

We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The proceeds from the November 2012 and the December 2014 Notes were used for general corporate purposes. The proceeds from the August 2017 Notes were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay notes due in 2017, and for general corporate purposes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $ 24.3 billion and $ 26.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In October 2016, we entered into a $ 500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables , which we subsequently increased to $ 740 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until October 2022, bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“ LIBOR ”) plus 1.40 % , and has a commitment fee of 0.50 % on the undrawn portion.

There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 . In April 2018, in connection with our Commercial Paper Program, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders to increase our borrowing capacity thereunder to $ 7.0 billion . As amended and restated, the Credit Agreement has a term of three years , but it may be extended for up to three additional one -year terms if approved by the lenders.

For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (2) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements and lease arrangements prior to the lease commencement date and digital media content liabilities associated with long-term digital media content assets with initial terms greater than one year. (3) Excludes approximately $ 3.9 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any. Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , we have pledged or otherwise restricted $ 575 million and $ 994 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller receivables for debt related to our Credit Facility. See “Note 6 — Debt.” Suppliers During 2019 , no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies In 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our review is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, “Other Information — Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.” We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on 59 Table of Contents transactions by our third-party sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and we have appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If other tax authorities were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law.

The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage and hour statute.

We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In April 2019, Vocalife LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com LLC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon Echo devices infringe U.S. Patent No. RE47,049, entitled “Microphone Array System.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2019, Neodron Ltd. filed a petition with the United States International Trade Commission requesting that the International Trade Commission commence an investigation into the sale of Amazon Fire HD 10 tablets and certain Dell, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo, Microsoft, Motorola, and Samsung devices (the “accused devices”). Neodron’s petition alleges that the accused devices infringe at least one of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,422,173, entitled “Capacitive Position Sensor”; 8,791,910, entitled “Capacitive Keyboard With Position-Dependent Reduced Keying Ambiguity”; 9,024,790, entitled “Capacitive Keyboard With Non-Locking Reduced Keying Ambiguity”; and 9,372,580, entitled “Enhanced Touch Detection Methods.” Neodron is seeking a limited exclusion order preventing the importation of the accused devices into the United States. In December 2019, Neodron withdrew its infringement allegations against Amazon with regard to U.S. Patent No. 9,372,580. In May 2019, Neodron also filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon’s Fire HD 10 tablet infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 8,422,173, entitled “Capacitive Position Sensor,” and 9,372,580, entitled “Enhanced Touch Detection Methods.” The May 2019 complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and interest, a permanent injunction, and enhanced damages. In June 2019, Neodron filed a second complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon’s Fire HD 10 tablet infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 9,823,784, entitled “Capacitive Touch Screen With Noise Suppression”; 9,489,072, entitled “Noise Reduction In Capacitive Touch Sensors”; and 61 Table of Contents 8,502,547, entitled “Capacitive Sensor.” The June 2019 complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and interest, a permanent injunction, and enhanced damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. In addition, for the matters disclosed above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies.

No preferred stock was outstanding for any year presented. Common Stock Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 504 million , 507 million , and 512 million , as of December 31, 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. Stock Repurchase Activity In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $ 5.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2017 , 2018 , or 2019 . Stock Award Plans Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards and stock options over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years . Stock Award Activity Stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2017 2018 2019 Cost of sales $ 47 $ 73 $ 149 Fulfillment 911 1,121 1,182 Technology and content 2,305 2,888 3,725 Marketing 511 769 1,135 General and administrative 441 567 673 Total stock-based compensation expense (1) $ 4,215 $ 5,418 $ 6,864 ___________________ (1) The related tax benefits were $ 860 million , $ 1.1 billion , and $ 1.4 billion for 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . 62 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our restricted stock unit activity (in millions): Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding as of January 1, 2017 19.8 $ 506 Units granted 8.9 946 Units vested ( 6.8 ) 400 Units forfeited ( 1.8 ) 649 Outstanding as of December 31, 2017 20.1 725 Units granted 5.0 1,522 Units vested ( 7.1 ) 578 Units forfeited ( 2.1 ) 862 Outstanding as of December 31, 2018 15.9 1,024 Units granted 6.7 1,808 Units vested ( 6.6 ) 827 Units forfeited ( 1.7 ) 1,223 Outstanding as of December 31, 2019 14.3 1,458 Scheduled vesting for outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2019 , is as follows (in millions): Year Ended 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total Scheduled vesting — restricted stock units 6.0 5.1 2.1 1.0 — 0.1 14.3 As of December 31, 2019 , there was $ 8.8 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with approximately half of the compensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a weighted-average recognition period of 1.1 years. The estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 was 28 % , 27 % , and 27 % . Changes in our estimates and assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. During 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 , the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $ 6.8 billion , $ 11.4 billion , and $ 11.7 billion . Common Stock Available for Future Issuance As of December 31, 2019 , common stock available for future issuance to employees is 108 million shares. Note 9 — INCOME TAXES In 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 , we recorded net tax provisions of $ 769 million , $ 1.2 billion , and $ 2.4 billion . Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $ 957 million , $ 1.2 billion , and $ 881 million for 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approximately $ 789 million . This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Act. 63 Table of Contents The components of the provision for income taxes, net are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2017 2018 2019 U.S. Federal: Current $ ( 137 ) $ ( 129 ) $ 162 Deferred ( 202 ) 565 914 Total ( 339 ) 436 1,076 U.S. State: Current 211 322 276 Deferred ( 26 ) 5 8 Total 185 327 284 International: Current 724 563 1,140 Deferred 199 ( 129 ) ( 126 ) Total 923 434 1,014 Provision for income taxes, net $ 769 $ 1,197 $ 2,374 U.S. and international components of income before income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2017 2018 2019 U.S. $ 5,630 $ 11,157 $ 13,285 International ( 1,824 ) 104 691 Income before income taxes $ 3,806 $ 11,261 $ 13,976 The items accounting for differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision recorded for income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2017 2018 2019 Income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate (1) $ 1,332 $ 2,365 $ 2,935 Effect of: Tax impact of foreign earnings 1,178 119 381 State taxes, net of federal benefits 114 263 221 Tax credits ( 220 ) ( 419 ) ( 466 ) Stock-based compensation (2) ( 917 ) ( 1,086 ) ( 850 ) 2017 Impact of U.S. Tax Act ( 789 ) ( 157 ) — Other, net 71 112 153 Total $ 769 $ 1,197 $ 2,374 ___________________ (1) The U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. (2) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $ 1.3 billion , $ 1.6 billion , and $ 1.4 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 . Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we 64 Table of Contents recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $ 600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2018 2019 Deferred tax assets (1): Loss carryforwards U.S. - Federal/States 222 188 Loss carryforwards - Foreign 2,551 3,232 Accrued liabilities, reserves, and other expenses 1,064 1,373 Stock-based compensation 1,293 1,585 Depreciation and amortization 2,386 2,385 Operating lease liabilities — 6,648 Other items 484 728 Tax credits 734 772 Total gross deferred tax assets 8,734 16,911 Less valuation allowances (2) ( 4,950 ) ( 5,754 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 3,784 11,157 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 3,579 ) ( 5,507 ) Operating lease assets — ( 6,331 ) Other items ( 749 ) ( 640 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowances $ ( 544 ) $ ( 1,321 ) ___________________ (1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies. (2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 . Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December 31, 2019 were approximately $ 8.6 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2020 . As of December 31, 2019 , our federal tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $ 1.7 billion . If not utilized, a portion of the tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027 . Tax Contingencies We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. 65 Table of Contents The reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions): December 31, 2017 2018 2019 Gross tax contingencies – January 1 $ 1,710 $ 2,309 $ 3,414 Gross increases to tax positions in prior periods 223 164 216 Gross decreases to tax positions in prior periods ( 139 ) ( 90 ) ( 181 ) Gross increases to current period tax positions 518 1,088 707 Settlements with tax authorities — ( 36 ) ( 207 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 3 ) ( 21 ) ( 26 ) Gross tax contingencies – December 31 (1) $ 2,309 $ 3,414 $ 3,923 ___________________ (1) As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $ 3.9 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $ 2.1 billion , if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019 , we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $ 127 million and $ 131 million . Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2018 , and 2019 was $ 40 million , $ 20 million , and $ 4 million . We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2007 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately € 250 million , plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter. Changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2019 . The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. 66 Table of Contents North America The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other service offerings for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.

Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter. Unaudited quarterly results are as follows (in millions, except per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2018 (1) First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net sales $ 51,042 $ 52,886 $ 56,576 $ 72,383 Operating income 1,927 2,983 3,724 3,786 Income before income taxes 1,916 2,605 3,390 3,350 Provision for income taxes ( 287 ) ( 74 ) ( 508 ) ( 327 ) Net income 1,629 2,534 2,883 3,027 Basic earnings per share 3.36 5.21 5.91 6.18 Diluted earnings per share 3.27 5.07 5.75 6.04 Shares used in computation of earnings per share: Basic 484 486 488 490 Diluted 498 500 501 501 Year Ended December 31, 2019 (1) First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net sales $ 59,700 $ 63,404 $ 69,981 $ 87,437 Operating income 4,420 3,084 3,157 3,879 Income before income taxes 4,401 2,889 2,632 4,053 Provision for income taxes ( 836 ) ( 257 ) ( 494 ) ( 786 ) Net income 3,561 2,625 2,134 3,268 Basic earnings per share 7.24 5.32 4.31 6.58 Diluted earnings per share 7.09 5.22 4.23 6.47 Shares used in computation of earnings per share: Basic 491 493 495 496 Diluted 502 503 504 505 ___________________ (1) The sum of quarterly amounts, including per share amounts, may not equal amounts reported for year-to-date periods. This is due to the effects of rounding and changes in the number of weighted-average shares outstanding for each period. 70 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants On Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of December 31, 2019 . Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2019 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2019 , our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 71 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 and the related notes and our report dated January 30, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington January 30, 2020 72 Table of Contents Item 9B.

Business This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I — “Risk Factors.” Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate offices are located in Seattle, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AMZN.” As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. General We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017. Consumers We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo devices, and we develop and produce media content. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible through low everyday product pricing and shipping offers, and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use functionality, fast and reliable fulfillment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, access to unlimited streaming of thousands of movies and TV episodes, and other benefits. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.” Sellers We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs. Developers and Enterprises We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. 3 Table of Contents Content Creators We serve authors and independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. Competition Our businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; and (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Intellectual Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. We recognized 32% , 34% , and 31% of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Fourth quarter 2017 results include revenue attributable to Whole Foods Market, which we acquired on August 28, 2017. Employees We employed approximately 647,500 full-time and part-time employees as of December 31, 2018 . However, employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils, statutory employee representation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of our studio operations within the United States. We consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.

Weeks 59 Chief Executive Officer, Corning Incorporated 5 Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk Factors Please carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. We Face Intense Competition Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices, web and infrastructure computing services, and transportation and logistics services, and across geographies, including cross-border competition. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Competition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices, may increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources We are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Business, Legal, Financial, and Competitive Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following: • our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands; • our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; • our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; • the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; • changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; 6 Table of Contents • timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; • the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; • the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth; • the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; • variations in the mix of products and services we sell; • variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; • the extent to which we offer free shipping, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; • factors affecting our reputation or brand image; • the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; • increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies; • the extent to which our equity-method investees record significant operating and non-operating items; • the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; • our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; • the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and • terrorist attacks and armed hostilities. Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • local economic and political conditions; • government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership; • restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; • business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices; • limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; • limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; • shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; • laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; • lower levels of use of the Internet; • lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; • lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; • difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; 7 Table of Contents • different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; • compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; • laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and • geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth. The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements, www.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technology services in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India are actively considering changes in their foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. If We Do Not Successfully Optimize and Operate Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers, Our Business Could Be Harmed If we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, or harm our business in other ways. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. In addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, and similar factors. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. 8 Table of Contents The Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations We expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory. We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, if the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • impairment of other relationships; • variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and • difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions (such as our acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc.) create risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • problems retaining key personnel; • additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; • the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions; 9 Table of Contents • the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations; • the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; • the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; • the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented; • for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes; • the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company; • the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face; • potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and • for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results. We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa. The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches Because we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors’ or customers’ technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services, and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including 10 Table of Contents systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security. We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. We Face Significant Inventory Risk In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results. We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or May Be Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. Other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. 11 Table of Contents Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service. We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as: • changes in interest rates; • conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in; • quarterly variations in operating results; • fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular; • changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts; • changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; • changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and • transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both. Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, data protection, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, including certain aspects of our seller programs. Unfavorable regulations, laws, and decisions interpreting or applying those laws and regulations could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services and increase our cost of doing business. We Could Be Subject to Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply by the effective date. 12 Table of Contents Our tax expense and liabilities may also be affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, the legislation known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”) requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code of standards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We May Be Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our services and stores that may increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, 13 Table of Contents including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached, compromised, or otherwise unable to detect or prevent fraudulent activity, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. In these jurisdictions, we may be subject to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services. We Could Be Liable for Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions. We also may be unable to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, to the extent any of this occurs, it could harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview Our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers . The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, and advertising. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows 1 . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and other facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. _______________________ (1) See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. (2) Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. 18 Table of Contents Because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle 3 . On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 504 million and 507 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” _______________________ (3) The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 19 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018 , we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $190 million. In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the U.S. tax reform legislation commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 20 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 17,203 $ 18,365 $ 30,723 Investing activities (9,516 ) (27,084 ) (12,369 ) Financing activities (3,716 ) 9,928 (7,686 ) Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $ 26.0 billion , $31.0 billion , and $41.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were $9.1 billion , $11.1 billion , and $13.8 billion , as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $17.2 billion , $18.4 billion , and $30.7 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(9.5) billion , $(27.1) billion , and $(12.4) billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $ 6.7 billion , $ 10.1 billion , and $11.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), during all three years. In 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $116 million , $14.0 billion , and $2.2 billion . Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.7) billion , $9.9 billion , and $(7.7) billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other, which were $4.3 billion , $6.3 billion , and $8.5 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Property and equipment acquired under capital leases was $5.7 billion , $9.6 billion , and $10.6 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $618 million , $16.2 billion , and $768 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . During 2017, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057. The proceeds from notes issued in August 2017 (the “August 2017 Notes”) were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay notes due in 2017, and for general corporate purposes. 21 Table of Contents In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2018 . We had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $594 million of borrowings outstanding under our $620 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December 31, 2018 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 5 — Debt” for additional information. In 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we recorded net tax provisions of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion . Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As of December 31, 2018 , cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $12.0 billion. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $412 million , $957 million , and $1.2 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . As of December 31, 2018 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $1.3 billion and $426 million . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $13.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 . These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Whole Foods Market from the date of acquisition in August 2017. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Net Sales Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, Amazon Prime membership fees, advertising services, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Net Sales: North America $ 79,785 $ 106,110 $ 141,366 International 43,983 54,297 65,866 AWS 12,219 17,459 25,655 Consolidated $ 135,987 $ 177,866 $ 232,887 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: North America 25 % 33 % 33 % International 24 23 21 AWS 55 43 47 Consolidated 27 31 31 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America 25 % 33 % 33 % International 26 23 19 AWS 55 43 47 Consolidated 28 31 30 Net sales mix: North America 59 % 60 % 61 % International 32 30 28 AWS 9 10 11 Consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % Sales increased 31% in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $(550) million , $210 million , and $1.3 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below. North America sales increased 33% in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and the impact of the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. International sales increased 23% and 21% in 2017 , and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(489) million , $138 million , and $1.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . AWS sales increased 43 % and 47 % in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 23 Table of Contents Operating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Operating Income (Loss): North America $ 2,361 $ 2,837 $ 7,267 International (1,283 ) (3,062 ) (2,142 ) AWS 3,108 4,331 7,296 Consolidated $ 4,186 $ 4,106 $ 12,421 Operating income was $4.2 billion , $4.1 billion , and $12.4 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The increase in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by costs to expand our fulfillment network. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $27 million , $(4) million , and $17 million for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by costs to expand our fulfillment network. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $89 million , $(85) million , and $258 million for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $(5) million , $(53) million , and $(49) million for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . 24 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Information about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Operating expenses: Cost of sales $ 88,265 $ 111,934 $ 139,156 Fulfillment 17,619 25,249 34,027 Marketing 7,233 10,069 13,814 Technology and content 16,085 22,620 28,837 General and administrative 2,432 3,674 4,336 Other operating expense, net 167 214 296 Total operating expenses $ 131,801 $ 173,760 $ 220,466 Year-over-year Percentage Growth: Cost of sales 23 % 27 % 24 % Fulfillment 31 43 35 Marketing 38 39 37 Technology and content 28 41 27 General and administrative 39 51 18 Other operating expense, net (2 ) 28 38 Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 64.9 % 62.9 % 59.8 % Fulfillment 13.0 14.2 14.6 Marketing 5.3 5.7 5.9 Technology and content 11.8 12.7 12.4 General and administrative 1.8 2.1 1.9 Other operating expense, net 0.1 0.1 0.1 Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $16.2 billion , $21.7 billion , and $27.7 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. 25 Table of Contents Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores, and variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels. We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. Marketing We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels. While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. 26 Table of Contents Other Operating Expense, Net Other operating expense, net was $167 million , $214 million , and $296 million during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. Interest Income and Expense Our interest income was $100 million , $202 million , and $440 million during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $484 million , $848 million , and $1.4 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-term debt and capital and finance lease arrangements. Our long-term debt was $24.7 billion and $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Our other long-term liabilities were $21.0 billion and $27.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 5 — Debt and Note 6 — Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional information. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was $90 million , $346 million , and $(183) million during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to foreign currency, equity warrant valuation, and equity securities gains. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Act. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the one-time favorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to the 27 Table of Contents U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit, and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As of December 31, 2018 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information. Equity-Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax Equity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(96) million , $(4) million , and $9 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The primary components of this activity during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 were our equity-method investment gains (losses) during the years and impairments recorded in 2016. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases. As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to add restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives,” which both are included in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 17,203 $ 18,365 $ 30,723 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives (6,737 ) (10,058 ) (11,323 ) Free cash flow $ 10,466 $ 8,307 $ 19,400 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (9,516 ) $ (27,084 ) $ (12,369 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (3,716 ) $ 9,928 $ (7,686 ) 28 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Less Lease Principal Repayments Free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities. Free cash flow less lease principal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 17,203 $ 18,365 $ 30,723 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives (6,737 ) (10,058 ) (11,323 ) Principal repayments of capital lease obligations (3,860 ) (4,799 ) (7,449 ) Principal repayments of finance lease obligations (147 ) (200 ) (337 ) Free cash flow less lease principal repayments $ 6,459 $ 3,308 $ 11,614 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (9,516 ) $ (27,084 ) $ (12,369 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (3,716 ) $ 9,928 $ (7,686 ) Free Cash Flow Less Finance Lease Principal Repayments and Assets Acquired Under Capital Leases Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which is included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 17,203 $ 18,365 $ 30,723 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives (6,737 ) (10,058 ) (11,323 ) Property and equipment acquired under capital leases (5,704 ) (9,637 ) (10,615 ) Principal repayments of finance lease obligations (147 ) (200 ) (337 ) Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases $ 4,615 $ (1,530 ) $ 8,448 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (9,516 ) $ (27,084 ) $ (12,369 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (3,716 ) $ 9,928 $ (7,686 ) All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. 29 Table of Contents Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior years. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2018 As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) Net sales $ 135,987 $ 550 $ 136,537 $ 177,866 $ (210 ) $ 177,656 $ 232,887 $ (1,253 ) $ 231,634 Operating expenses 131,801 660 132,461 173,760 (352 ) 173,408 220,466 (1,027 ) 219,439 Operating income 4,186 (110 ) 4,076 4,106 142 4,248 12,421 (226 ) 12,195 ___ ________________ (1) Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year for operating results.

Guidance We provided guidance on January 31, 2019 , in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January 31, 2019 , and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” First Quarter 2019 Guidance • Net sales are expected to be between $56 billion and $60 billion, or to grow between 10% and 18% compared with first quarter 2018. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 210 basis points from foreign exchange rates. • Operating income is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in first quarter 2018. • This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. 30 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk During 2018 , net sales from our International segment accounted for 28% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $1.3 billion in comparison with the prior year. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2018 , of $13.8 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $690 million, $1.4 billion, and $2.8 billion. All cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2018 , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $145 million, $305 million, and $685 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates. 32 Table of Contents Investment Risk As of December 31, 2018 , our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $942 million. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $518 million of our investments as of December 31, 2018 , and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment to fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 33 Table of Contents Item 8.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 31, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.” Prior Period Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities (collectively, the “Company”). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 474 480 487 Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 10 13 13 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 484 493 500 41 Table of Contents Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks, digital video, e-books, digital music, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period. AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term. Other - Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions. Return Allowances Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $567 million , $468 million , and $623 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Additions to the allowance were $1.5 billion , $1.8 billion , and $2.3 billion and deductions from the allowance were $1.5 billion , $1.9 billion , and $2.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Included in “Inventories” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $411 million , $406 million , and $519 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor Agreements We have agreements with our vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. 42 Table of Contents Fulfillment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and physical stores, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Marketing Marketing costs primarily consist of targeted online advertising, payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, and television advertising. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties. Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $5.0 billion , $6.3 billion , and $8.2 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Prepaid advertising costs were not significant as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Technology and Content Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation expense and rent; professional fees and litigation costs; and other general corporate costs for corporate functions, including accounting, finance, tax, legal, and human resources, among others. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Other Operating Expense, Net Other operating expense, net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, and expenses related to legal settlements. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) of $21 million , $247 million , and $(206) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 and equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $67 million , $109 million , and $(131) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 and equity securities gains of $1 million , $18 million , and $145 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . 43 Table of Contents Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. For our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As part of entering into commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , these warrants had a fair value of $441 million and $440 million , and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. The related gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $67 million , $109 million , and $(131) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . These assets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories. 44 Table of Contents We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , customer receivables, net, were $6.4 billion and $9.4 billion , vendor receivables, net, were $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion , and seller receivables, net, were $692 million and $710 million . Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. We estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $237 million , $348 million , and $495 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Additions to the allowance were $451 million , $626 million , and $878 million , and deductions to the allowance were $403 million , $515 million , and $731 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction in our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit, finance, and capital lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years for our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations We categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other incentives provided by the landlord. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease. We establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we assess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities are accounted for as finance leases. We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. As disclosed in “Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted,” our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on January 1, 2019. 45 Table of Contents Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2018 , and determined that goodwill is no t impaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 4 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.” Other Assets Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; and equity warrant assets. Video and Music Content We obtain video and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions, which include both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available for streaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage patterns, which typically ranges from one to five years. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original content. Capitalized production costs associated with our original content are limited by the amount of revenue we expect to earn, which results in a portion being expensed as incurred. These capitalized costs are amortized to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing pattern of customer streams in the first months after availability. Investments We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.” Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity - method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statement of operations. We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment. For debt securities and equity method investments, we also evaluate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we 46 Table of Contents assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include: quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of the decline in value; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accrued Expenses and Other Included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $2.9 billion and $3.4 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion . We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2017 was $6.1 billion , of which $5.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 , including adjustments related to the new revenue recognition guidance. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 . The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. Foreign Currency We have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $62 million , $202 million , and $(186) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . 47 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and increased retained earnings by approximately $650 million . The adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards, which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote. We changed the recognition and classification of Amazon Prime memberships, which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the membership period as service sales. Previously, Prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product sales and service sales. Other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services are now classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis. Prior year amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy. The impact of applying this ASU for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service sales driven by the reclassification of Prime membership fees of approximately $3.8 billion . Service sales also increased by approximately $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the reclassification of certain advertising services. In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Under this ASU, certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $250 million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances. In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 Previously Reported Adjustments As Revised Operating activities $ 17,272 $ (69 ) $ 17,203 Investing activities (9,876 ) 360 (9,516 ) Financing activities (3,740 ) 24 (3,716 ) Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 3,656 $ 315 $ 3,971 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Previously Reported Adjustments As Revised Operating activities $ 18,434 $ (69 ) $ 18,365 Investing activities (27,819 ) 735 (27,084 ) Financing activities 9,860 68 9,928 Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 475 $ 734 $ 1,209 48 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 with an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. This adoption approach will result in a balance sheet presentation that will not be comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU will result in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately $21 billion , which includes the reclassification of finance leases to operating leases of approximately $1.2 billion , and the derecognition of build-to-suit lease assets and liabilities when we do not control the building during the construction period of approximately $1.5 billion . Note 2 — CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and other investment grade securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. The following table summarizes, by major security type, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy (in millions): December 31, 2017 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 9,982 $ — $ — $ 9,982 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 11,343 — — 11,343 Equity securities 23 30 — 53 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 620 — — 620 U.S. government and agency securities 4,841 1 (19 ) 4,823 Corporate debt securities 4,265 1 (9 ) 4,257 Asset-backed securities 910 — (5 ) 905 Other fixed income securities 340 — (2 ) 338 $ 32,324 $ 32 $ (35 ) $ 32,321 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (1) (1,335 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 30,986 49 Table of Contents December 31, 2018 Cost or Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Total Estimated Fair Value Cash $ 10,406 $ — $ — $ 10,406 Level 1 securities: Money market funds 12,515 — — 12,515 Equity securities 29 143 (2 ) 170 Level 2 securities: Foreign government and agency securities 815 — — 815 U.S. government and agency securities 11,686 1 (20 ) 11,667 Corporate debt securities 5,008 1 (19 ) 4,990 Asset-backed securities 896 — (4 ) 892 Other fixed income securities 190 — (2 ) 188 Equity securities 28 5 — 33 $ 41,573 $ 150 $ (47 ) $ 41,676 Less: Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (1) (426 ) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 41,250 ___________________ (1) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as “Accounts receivable, net and other” and of twelve months or longer as non-current “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies.” The following table summarizes gross gains and gross losses realized on sales of available-for-sale fixed income marketable securities (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Realized gains $ 3 $ 5 $ 2 Realized losses 11 11 9 The following table summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value Due within one year $ 27,520 $ 27,508 Due after one year through five years 2,865 2,845 Due after five years through ten years 187 185 Due after ten years 538 529 Total $ 31,110 $ 31,067 Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have certain prepayment conditions. 50 Table of Contents The following table provides a reconciliation of the amount of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions): December 31, 2017 December 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 20,522 $ 31,750 Restricted cash included in accounts receivable, net and other 1,329 418 Restricted cash included in other assets 5 5 Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 21,856 $ 32,173 Note 3 — PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment, at cost, consisted of the following (in millions): December 31, 2017 2018 Gross property and equipment (1): Land and buildings $ 23,896 $ 31,741 Equipment 42,244 54,591 Other assets 2,438 2,577 Construction in progress 4,078 6,861 Gross property and equipment 72,656 95,770 Total accumulated depreciation and amortization (1) 23,790 33,973 Total property and equipment, net $ 48,866 $ 61,797 ___________________ (1) We revised our prior year presentation of gross property and equipment and total accumulated depreciation and amortization to include all property and equipment in service, including equipment which is fully-depreciated, to conform to the current year presentation. Total property and equipment, net remains unchanged for the prior year. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $6.4 billion , $8.8 billion , and $12.1 billion which includes amortization of property and equipment acquired under capital leases of $3.8 billion , $5.4 billion , and $7.3 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Gross assets recorded under capital leases were $26.4 billion and $36.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accumulated amortization associated with capital leases was $13.4 billion and $19.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . We capitalize construction in progress and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are considered the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction period. For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which do not qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these buildings. This is principally due to our significant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the buildings are being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the related leases’ terms. Additionally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangements and finance leases provide purchase options. Upon occupancy, the long-term construction obligations are considered long-term finance lease obligations with amounts payable during the next 12 months recorded as “Accrued expenses and other.” Gross assets remaining under finance leases were $5.4 billion and $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accumulated amortization associated with finance leases was $635 million and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As disclosed in “Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on January 1, 2019. Note 4 — ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 2016 Acquisition Activity During 2016 , we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $103 million . The primary reason for these acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our consolidated financial statements, was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. 51 Table of Contents 2017 Acquisition Activity On May 12, 2017 , we acquired Souq Group Ltd. (“Souq”), an e-commerce company, for approximately $583 million , net of cash acquired, and on August 28, 2017, we acquired Whole Foods Market, a grocery store chain, for approximately $13.2 billion , net of cash acquired. Both acquisitions are intended to expand our retail presence. During 2017 , we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $204 million . The primary reason for our other 2017 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. 2018 Acquisition Activity On April 12, 2018 , we acquired Ring Inc. (“Ring”) for cash consideration of approximately $839 million , net of cash acquired, and on September 11, 2018 , we acquired PillPack, Inc. (“PillPack”) for cash consideration of approximately $753 million , net of cash acquired, to expand our product and service offerings. During 2018 , we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $57 million . The primary reason for our other 2018 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Purchase Price Allocation The aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions was allocated as follows (in millions): December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Purchase Price Cash paid, net of cash acquired $ 81 $ 13,859 $ 1,618 Indemnification holdback 22 104 31 $ 103 $ 13,963 $ 1,649 Allocation Goodwill $ 60 $ 9,501 $ 1,228 Intangible assets (1): Marketing-related 2 1,987 186 Contract-based 1 440 13 Technology-based 53 166 285 Customer-related 1 54 193 57 2,647 677 Property and equipment 3 3,810 11 Deferred tax assets 17 117 174 Other assets acquired 10 1,858 282 Long-term debt (5 ) (1,165 ) (176 ) Deferred tax liabilities (18 ) (961 ) (159 ) Other liabilities assumed (21 ) (1,844 ) (388 ) $ 103 $ 13,963 $ 1,649 ___________________ (1) Intangible assets acquired in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 have estimated useful lives of between one and seven years, one and twenty-five years, and two and seven years, with weighted-average amortization periods of five years, twenty-one years, and six years. We determined the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach. These assets are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 52 Table of Contents Goodwill The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax purposes.

Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The proceeds from the November 2012 and the December 2014 Notes were used for general corporate purposes. The proceeds from the August 2017 Notes were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay notes due in 2017, and for general corporate purposes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $25.7 billion and $24.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables , which we subsequently increased to $620 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available for a term of three years , bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“ LIBOR ”) plus 1.65% , and has a commitment fee of 0.50% on the undrawn portion. There were $592 million and $594 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , which had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.7% and 3.2% as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we 54 Table of Contents have pledged $686 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . The other debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate of 5.8% and 6.0% as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . We used the net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain business operations. The estimated fair value of the other long-term debt, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As of December 31, 2018 , future principal payments for our total debt were as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 $ 1,371 2020 1,298 2021 1,016 2022 1,266 2023 1,014 Thereafter 19,000 $ 24,965 In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2018 . In April 2018, in connection with our Commercial Paper Program, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders to increase our borrowing capacity thereunder to $7.0 billion . As amended and restated, the Credit Agreement has a term of three years , but it may be extended for up to three additional one -year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the amended and restated Credit Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.50% , with a commitment fee of 0.04% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

Long-term finance lease obligations are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2018 Gross finance lease obligations $ 8,376 Less imputed interest (1,323 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments 7,053 Less current portion of finance lease obligations (411 ) Total long-term finance lease obligations $ 6,642 As disclosed in “Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on January 1, 2019. Construction Liabilities We capitalize construction in progress and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are considered the owner during the construction period for accounting purposes. These liabilities primarily relate to our corporate buildings and fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data centers. As disclosed in “Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on January 1, 2019. Tax Contingencies We have recorded reserves for tax contingencies, inclusive of accrued interest and penalties, for U.S. and foreign income taxes. These reserves primarily relate to transfer pricing and state income taxes, and are presented net of offsetting deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credits. See “Note 9 — Income Taxes” for discussion of tax contingencies. 56 Table of Contents Note 7 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We have entered into non-cancellable operating, capital, and finance leases for equipment and office, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, data center, physical store, and renewable energy facilities. Rental expense under operating lease agreements was $1.4 billion , $2.2 billion , and $3.4 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The following summarizes our principal contractual commitments, excluding open orders for purchases that support normal operations and are generally cancellable, as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Debt principal and interest $ 2,277 $ 2,161 $ 1,861 $ 2,078 $ 1,781 $ 30,013 $ 40,171 Capital lease obligations, including interest (1) 7,807 5,742 2,725 704 473 501 17,952 Finance lease obligations, including interest (2) 628 640 652 664 675 5,117 8,376 Operating leases 3,127 3,070 2,775 2,473 2,195 13,026 26,666 Unconditional purchase obligations (3) 3,523 4,103 3,291 3,098 2,974 5,204 22,193 Other commitments (4) (5) 2,618 1,455 1,056 843 808 8,875 15,655 Total commitments $ 19,980 $ 17,171 $ 12,360 $ 9,860 $ 8,906 $ 62,736 $ 131,013 ___________________ (1) Excluding interest, current capital lease obligations of $5.8 billion and $7.7 billion are recorded within “Accrued expenses and other” as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , and $8.4 billion and $9.6 billion are recorded within “Other long-term liabilities” as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 .

(3) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores and long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (4) Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements and equipment lease arrangements that have not been placed in service and digital media content liabilities associated with long-term digital media content assets with initial terms greater than one year. (5) Excludes approximately $3.4 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any. Pledged Assets As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we have pledged or otherwise restricted $1.4 billion and $575 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Suppliers During 2018 , no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies In 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our review is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, “Other Information — Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.” 57 Table of Contents We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-party sellers. We believe the assessment is without merit. If South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In November 2007, an Austrian copyright collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logistik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germany seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed the German case pending a final decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana’s claim and in September 2010 commenced an appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of the tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditions set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana’s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana’s appeal. In February 2016, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. In March 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further proceedings. A number of additional actions have been filed making similar allegations. In December 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle für private Überspielungsrechte (“ZPU”), filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Media EU S.à r.l., Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, and Amazon Eurasia Holdings S.à r.l. in the District Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website to customers located in Germany. In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.à r.l. in the Court of First Instance of Brussels, Belgium, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. In November 2013, the Belgian court ruled in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August 2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v.

Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and former employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states including Arizona, California, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, and Nevada, and one complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage and hour statute. In February 2015, the courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. In March 2016, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealed the district court’s judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the court of 58 Table of Contents appeals affirmed the district court’s decision. In June 2017, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Busk and Saldana cases with prejudice. We dispute any remaining allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. In addition, for the matters disclosed above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. See also “Note 9 — Income Taxes.” Note 8 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Preferred Stock We have authorized 500 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock. No preferred stock was outstanding for any year presented. Common Stock Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 497 million , 504 million , and 507 million , as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. Stock Repurchase Activity In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2016 , 2017 , or 2018 . Stock Award Plans Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards and stock options over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years . 60 Table of Contents Stock Award Activity Stock-based compensation expense is as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Cost of sales $ 16 $ 47 $ 73 Fulfillment 657 911 1,121 Marketing 323 511 769 Technology and content 1,664 2,305 2,888 General and administrative 315 441 567 Total stock-based compensation expense (1) $ 2,975 $ 4,215 $ 5,418 ___________________ (1) The related tax benefits were $907 million , $860 million , and $1.1 billion for 2016, 2017, and 2018. In 2017 and 2018, the tax benefit reflects the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% . The following table summarizes our restricted stock unit activity (in millions): Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding as of January 1, 2016 18.9 $ 362 Units granted 9.3 660 Units vested (6.1 ) 321 Units forfeited (2.3 ) 440 Outstanding as of December 31, 2016 19.8 506 Units granted 8.9 946 Units vested (6.8 ) 400 Units forfeited (1.8 ) 649 Outstanding as of December 31, 2017 20.1 725 Units granted 5.0 1,522 Units vested (7.1 ) 578 Units forfeited (2.1 ) 862 Outstanding as of December 31, 2018 15.9 $ 1,024 Scheduled vesting for outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2018 , is as follows (in millions): Year Ended 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Scheduled vesting — restricted stock units 6.9 5.6 2.4 0.8 0.1 0.1 15.9 As of December 31, 2018 , there was $6.6 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with approximately half of the compensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a weighted-average recognition period of 1.1 years. The estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 was 28% , 28% , and 27% . Changes in our estimates and assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. During 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $4.3 billion , $6.8 billion , and $11.4 billion . Common Stock Available for Future Issuance As of December 31, 2018 , common stock available for future issuance to employees is 113 million shares. 61 Table of Contents Note 9 — INCOME TAXES In 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we recorded net tax provisions of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion . We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $412 million , $957 million , and $1.2 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% , eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approximately $789 million . This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% , after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Act. The components of the provision for income taxes, net are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Current taxes: U.S. Federal $ 1,136 $ (137 ) $ (129 ) U.S. State 208 211 322 International 327 724 563 Current taxes 1,671 798 756 Deferred taxes: U.S. Federal 116 (202 ) 565 U.S. State (31 ) (26 ) 5 International (331 ) 199 (129 ) Deferred taxes (246 ) (29 ) 441 Provision for income taxes, net $ 1,425 $ 769 $ 1,197 U.S. and international components of income before income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 U.S. $ 4,551 $ 5,630 $ 11,157 International (659 ) (1,824 ) 104 Income before income taxes $ 3,892 $ 3,806 $ 11,261 62 Table of Contents The items accounting for differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision recorded for income taxes are as follows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate (1) $ 1,362 $ 1,332 $ 2,365 Effect of: Tax impact of foreign earnings (69 ) 1,178 119 State taxes, net of federal benefits 110 114 263 Tax credits (119 ) (220 ) (419 ) Stock-based compensation (2) 189 (917 ) (1,086 ) Domestic production activities deduction (94 ) — — 2017 Impact of U.S. Tax Act — (789 ) (157 ) Other, net 46 71 112 Total $ 1,425 $ 769 $ 1,197 ___________________ (1) The U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. (2) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and beginning in 2017, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. For 2017 and 2018, our tax provision includes $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the one-time favorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments. We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. 63 Table of Contents Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): December 31, 2017 2018 Deferred tax assets (1): Loss carryforwards U.S. - Federal/States $ 211 $ 222 Loss carryforwards - Foreign 2,149 2,551 Accrued liabilities, reserves, and other expenses 901 1,064 Stock-based compensation 1,026 1,293 Deferred revenue 349 321 Assets held for investment 35 69 Depreciation and amortization 279 2,386 Other items 167 94 Tax credits 381 734 Total gross deferred tax assets 5,498 8,734 Less valuation allowance (2) (2,538 ) (4,950 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 2,960 3,784 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization (2,568 ) (3,579 ) Acquisition related intangible assets (531 ) (682 ) Other items (58 ) (67 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowance $ (197 ) $ (544 ) ___________________ (1) Deferred tax assets are presented net of tax contingencies. (2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions and future capital gains. As of December 31, 2018 , our federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $627 million , $7.8 billion , and $919 million . The federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable foreign and state tax law. If not utilized, a portion of the federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029 , 2019 , and 2019 , respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , our tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1.7 billion . If not utilized, a portion of the tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 . As of December 31, 2018 , our federal capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes was approximately $261 million . If not utilized, a portion of the capital loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 . Tax Contingencies We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. 64 Table of Contents The reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions): December 31, 2016 2017 2018 Gross tax contingencies – January 1 $ 1,181 $ 1,710 $ 2,309 Gross increases to tax positions in prior periods 355 223 164 Gross decreases to tax positions in prior periods (133 ) (139 ) (90 ) Gross increases to current period tax positions 308 518 1,088 Settlements with tax authorities — — (36 ) Lapse of statute of limitations (1 ) (3 ) (21 ) Gross tax contingencies – December 31 (1) $ 1,710 $ 2,309 $ 3,414 ___________________ (1) As of December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $3.4 billion of accrued tax contingencies, of which $1.7 billion , if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $107 million and $127 million . Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 was $9 million , $40 million , and $20 million . We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2005 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. As previously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. In September 2017, the IRS appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million , plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2008 and thereafter. We expect the total amount of tax contingencies will grow in 2019 . In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2018 . The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Marketing,” “Technology and content,” and “General and administrative” based 65 Table of Contents on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. North America The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. International The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. AWS The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other service offerings for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2018 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018 , our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 70 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes and our report dated January 31, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington January 31, 2019 71 Table of Contents Item 9B.
