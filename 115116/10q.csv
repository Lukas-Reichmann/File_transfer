Exhibits 36 SIGNATURES 37 Explanatory Note This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our.” Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “goal,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis, which could adversely affect our video businesses • the success of our businesses depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of international transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect our businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • a cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1:

STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior year periods to conform to classifications used in 2023. See Note 2 for a discussion of the changes in our presentation of segment operating results. Note 2: Segment Information Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our presentation of segment operating results around our two primary businesses: Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. Connectivity & Platforms: Contains our broadband and wireless connectivity businesses operated under the Xfinity and Comcast brands in the United States and under the Sky brand in certain territories in Europe (the “Connectivity & Platforms markets”). Also includes our video services businesses and the operations of our Sky-branded entertainment television channels in the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Our Connectivity & Platforms business is reported in two reportable business segments: • Residential Connectivity & Platforms Segment: Includes our residential broadband and wireless connectivity services, residential and business video services, advertising sales and Sky channels. Revenue is generated primarily from customers that subscribe to our services and from the sale of advertising and wireless devices. • Business Services Connectivity Segment: Includes our connectivity services for small business locations in the United States, which include broadband, voice and wireless services, as well as our solutions for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and our small business connectivity service offerings for international locations. Revenue is generated primarily from customers that subscribe to our services. Content & Experiences: Contains our media and entertainment businesses that develop, produce, and distribute entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences and that own and operate theme parks in the United States and Asia. Our Content & Experiences business is reported in three reportable business segments: • Media Segment: Includes primarily NBCUniversal ’ s television and streaming business, including national and regional cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; and Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service. Also includes international networks, including most of the Sky Sports channels, and other digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the distribution of our television and streaming programming and from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and other digital properties. • Studios Segment: Includes primarily our NBCUniversal and Sky film and television studio production and distribution operations. Revenue is generated primarily from licensing our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally; and from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. • Theme Parks Segment: Includes primarily the operations of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; Osaka, Japan; and Beijing, China. Revenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Our other business interests consist primarily of Sky operations outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets, the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the operations of Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications formed in June 2022. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. Transactions between our Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences businesses, and between segments within the Content & Experiences business, generally include intercompany profit consistent with third-party transactions. The segments within our Connectivity & Platforms business use certain shared infrastructure, including the cable distribution network in the United States, and each segment is presented with its direct costs and an allocation of shared costs, as well as revenue from its customers. Our financial data by reportable business segment is presented in the tables below and has been updated to reflect our new segment presentation, including: (1) presentation of Cable Communications results in the Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments and (2) presentation of Sky ’ s results across the segments within the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences businesses, and Corporate and Other. We do not present asset information for our reportable business segments as this information is not used to allocate resources and capital.

The most significant of these transactions include distribution revenue in Media related to fees from Residential Connectivity & Platforms for the rights to distribute television programming and content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. A summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.

In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. The term loan is due at the earlier of March 2024 or upon receipt of proceeds under the put/call provisions. As of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our collateralized obligation were each $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair values were based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheets in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method and, as a result, is less than its fair value. Other Investments Other investments also includes investments in certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, which are generally accounted for at amortized cost. These short-term instruments totaled $ 253 million and $ 304 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. Proceeds from short-term instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $ 339 million and $ 874 million, respectively. Purchases of short-term instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $ 286 million and $ 1.8 billion , respectively. Consolidated Variable Interest Entity Universal Beijing Resort We own a 30 % interest in a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”), which opened in September 2021. Universal Beijing Resort is a consolidated VIE with the remaining interest owned by a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies. The construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. As of September 30, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $ 3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $ 3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of September 30, 2023, our condensed consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 7.8 billion and $ 7.1 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.

Amounts are impacted by foreign currency translation each period. In the third quarter of 2022, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $ 8.1 billion in our Sky reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. When performing this analysis, we also considered multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions. The decline in fair value primarily resulted from an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions in the Sky territories. In connection with this assessment, in the third quarter of 2022, we also recorded impairments of intangible assets related to Sky, which primarily related to customer relationship assets. These impairments totaled $ 485 million and are presented in goodwill and long-lived asset impairments in the consolidated statement of income. 12 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 8: Equity and Share-Based Compensation Weighted-Average Common Shares Outstanding Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding – basic 4,109 4,377 4,160 4,449 Effect of dilutive securities 33 — 23 29 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding – diluted 4,141 4,377 4,184 4,477 Antidilutive securities 86 288 172 156 Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders (“diluted EPS”) considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method.

Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. In March 2023, we granted 22 million RSUs and 57 million stock options related to our annual management awards. The weighted-average fair values associated with these grants were $ 36.62 per RSU and $ 8.33 per stock option. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, share-based compensation expense recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income was $ 238 million and $ 256 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, share-based compensation expense recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of income was $ 786 million and $ 802 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, we had unrecognized pretax compensation expense of $ 2.2 billion related to nonvested RSUs and nonvested stock options. Note 9: Supplemental Financial Information Income Taxes In the third quarter of 2022, a state tax law change was enacted that resulted in a decrease to our net deferred tax liabilities of $ 286 million, with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense. The goodwill impairment in the third quarter of 2022 (see Note 7) was primarily not deductible for tax purposes.

Consolidated revenue increased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by an increase in the Connectivity & Platforms business. Consolidated revenue decreased slightly for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in the Content & Experiences business. Revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” 15 Table of Contents Consolidated costs and expenses , excluding depreciation expense, amortization expense and goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily driven by a decrease in the Content & Experiences business. Consolidated costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by decreases in the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences businesses. Costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased amortization of software, the impact of foreign currency and increased depreciation at our theme parks. Consolidated depreciation and amortization increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in amortization of software and depreciation at our theme parks. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $571 million and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and $517 million and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively . Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated goodwill and long-lived asset impairments included charges related to Sky totaling $8.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 recognized in connection with our annual impairment assessment. The impairments primarily reflected an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions in Sky’s territories. See “Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates” and Note 7 for further discussion. Consolidated interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increases in average debt outstanding and higher weighted-average interest rates. Consolidated investment and other income (loss), net increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 49 $ (242) $ 454 $ (523) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net (87) (2) (130) (207) Other income (loss), net 88 (21) 349 (245) Total investment and other income (loss), net $ 50 $ (266) $ 672 $ (975) The chang es in investment and other income (loss), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to equity in net income (losses) of investees, net driven by our investment in Atairos and changes in other income (loss), net and in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $252 million and $753 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and $(97) million and $(473) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. The changes in other income (loss), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from gains on foreign exchange remeasurement compared to losses in the prior year period and increased interest income compared to the prior year period. The change for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included gains on insurance contracts compared to losses in the prior year period. The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses on nonmarketable securities in the current year period. The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses on marketable securities in the prior year period, partially offset by losses on nonmarketable securities in the current year period compared to gains in the prior year period. 16 Table of Contents Consolidated income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The increases in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 were primarily driven by the effect of a change in our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of state tax law changes, which resulted in a $286 million benefit in the prior year periods and by higher income before income taxes. Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also impacted by the goodwill impairment related to Sky, which was primarily not deductible for tax purposes (see Note 9). Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests changed f or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with the same periods in 2022 primarily due to decreases in losses at Universal Beijing Resort as a result of increased operations in the current year periods, partially offset by increases in losses in our Xumo streaming platform joint venture in the current year periods. 17 Table of Contents Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information.

We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects the year-over-year basis point change. (b) Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 28 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts. We continue to focus on growing our higher-margin connectivity businesses while managing overall operating costs. We also continue to invest in our network to support higher-speed broadband offerings and to expand the number of homes and businesses passed. Our customer relationship growth has slowed primarily reflecting continued low domestic household move levels and an increasingly competitive environment. We believe our residential connectivity revenue will increase as a result of growth in average domestic broadband revenue per customer, as well as increases in international connectivity and domestic wireless revenue. At the same time, we expect continued declines in video revenue as a result of domestic customer net losses due to shifting video consumption patterns and the competitive environment, although customer net losses typically partially mitigate the impact of continued rate increases on programming expenses. We also expect continued declines in other revenue in wireline voice revenue. Global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations. We believe our Business Services Connectivity segment will continue to grow by offering competitive services, including to medium-sized and enterprise customers. 18 Table of Contents Connectivity & Platforms Customer Metrics Net Additions / (Losses) September 30, Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2023 2022 (d) 2023 2022 2023 2022 (d) Customer Relationships Domestic Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships (a) 31,722 31,928 (39) (26) (138) 119 International Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships (a) 17,958 17,884 74 96 18 (146) Business Services Connectivity customer relationships (b) 2,640 2,621 5 13 15 48 Total Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships 52,320 52,434 40 83 (105) 21 Domestic Broadband Residential customers 29,779 29,835 (17) 10 (33) 253 Business customers 2,508 2,507 (2) 10 1 34 Total domestic broadband customers 32,287 32,342 (18) 19 (32) 286 Domestic Wireless Total domestic wireless lines (c) 6,278 4,948 294 333 965 968 Domestic Video Total domestic video customers 14,495 16,582 (490) (561) (1,647) (1,594) (a) Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships generally represent the number of residential customer locations that subscribe to at least one of our services. International Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships represent customers receiving Sky services in the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Previously reported total Sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of December 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships receiving Sky services outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Because each of our services includes a variety of product tiers, which may change from time to time, net additions or losses in any one period will reflect a mix of customers at various tiers. (b) Business Services Connectivity customer metrics are gener ally counted based on the number of locations receiving services, including locations within our distribution system in the United States, as well as locations outside of our distribution system both in the United States and internationally. Certain arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system are also generally counted based on the number of locations served. (c) Domestic wireless lines represent the number of residential and business customers ’ wireless devices. An individual customer relationship may have multiple wireless lines. (d) Customer metrics for 2022 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certain customers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. These changes in methodology were not material to any period presented. Three Months Ended September 30, Change Constant Currency Change (a) Nine Months Ended September 30, Change Constant Currency Change (a) 2023 2022 % % 2023 2022 % % Average monthly total Connectivity & Platforms revenue per customer relationship $ 129.20 $ 127.55 1.3 % 0.3 % $ 128.95 $ 129.07 (0.1) % 0.1 % Average monthly total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 52.40 $ 50.79 3.2 % 2.8 % $ 52.32 $ 50.49 3.6 % 3.7 % (a) Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 28 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts. Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business customers, as well as changes in advertising and other revenue and in foreign currency exchange rates. While revenue from our individual service offerings is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses. 19 Table of Contents Connectivity & Platforms — Supplemental Costs and Expenses Information Connectivity & Platforms supplemental costs and expenses information in the table below is presented on an aggregate basis across the Connectivity & Platforms segments as the segments use certain shared infrastructure, including the cable distribution network in the United States.

We expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in paid subscribers and advertising revenue at Peacock. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing at Peacock, with such costs increasing in 2023. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Olympics, Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup in 2022. Global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations. Our Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content & Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. The Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began work stoppages in May and July 2023, respectively (collectively the “work stoppages”). The Writers Guild of America work stoppage ended at the end of September 2023. The pause in production during the work stoppages has primarily resulted in reduced content licensing revenue and programming and production costs at our Studios segment, which will continue in the near term. The work stoppages will also result in reduced programming and production costs at our Media segment in the near term. We continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks. Our results in prior periods were impacted by temporary restrictions and closures at our international theme parks due to COVID-19.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP. 28 Table of Contents Reconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 4,046 $ (4,598) $ 12,128 $ 2,347 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (49) (68) (175) (295) Income tax expense 1,468 1,014 4,481 3,562 Interest expense 1,060 960 3,068 2,922 Investment and other (income) loss, net (50) 266 (672) 975 Depreciation 2,203 2,150 6,662 6,525 Amortization 1,290 1,183 4,146 3,824 Goodwill and long-lived asset impairments — 8,583 — 8,583 Adjustments (a) (6) (9) (16) 15 Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,962 $ 9,482 $ 29,621 $ 28,459 (a) Amounts represent the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, including costs related to our investment portfolio. Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Connectivity & Platforms, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Connectivity & Platforms business, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the businesses, and we believe they are helpful for investors because such measures present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate their underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cas h equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program generally provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. As of September 30, 2023, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. In the third quarter of 2023, we amended our agreements with The Walt Disney Company regarding our ownership interest in Hulu and the related put and call provisions, which may now be exercised as early as November 2023. See Note 6 for additional information. Operating Activit ies Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income $ 18,830 $ 9,511 Depreciation and amortization 10,807 10,349 Goodwill and long-lived asset impairments — 8,583 Noncash share-based compensation 955 989 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (2,030) (2,736) Payments of interest (2,566) (2,341) Payments of income taxes (3,823) (4,022) Proceeds from investments and other 406 197 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 22,579 $ 20,530 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including reduced spending due to the work stoppages and the timing of sporting events, and the timing of recognition of deferred revenue. The increase in payments of interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to higher weighted-average interest rates and cash proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps related to the collateralized obligation in the prior year period. The decrease in payments of income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to higher payments in the prior year period relating to the preceding tax year, partially offset by higher taxable income in the current year period. 31 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily du e to increased capital expenditures, decreased proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments, increased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development and a sale of a business in the prior year period. The se increases were partially offset by de creased purchases of short-term investments and decreased cash paid related to the construction of Universal Beijing Resort in the current year period. Capital expenditures increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily reflecting increased spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions by the Connectivity & Platforms businesses and increased spending on the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando, as well as $271 million associated with the acquisition of land for potential theme park expansion opportunities. In September 2023, we entered into an agreement with T-Mobile to sell certain of our spectrum licenses. The agreement provides us with a right to remove certain licenses from the transaction, resulting in total cash consideration between $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion. The sale is expected to close in 2028 subject to various conditions and approvals. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher proceeds from borrow ings in the current year period and a de crease in the repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, partially offset by higher repurchases and repayments of debt and repayments of short-term borrowings in the current year period. In May 2023, we issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes maturing between 2029 and 2064, of which $2.9 billion was used to purchase senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025. In February 2023, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes maturing in 2033 and an amount equal to the net proceeds from this issuance is intended to finance or refinance one or more green projects, assets or activities that meet certain specified eligibility criteria. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made total debt repayments of $3.0 billion, including the $2.9 billion purchase of senior notes. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outst an ding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 5 and 8 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased a total of 180.5 million shares of our Clas s A common stock for $7.5 billion. As of September 30, 2023, we had $8.5 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase program. Under this authorizati on, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions. In addition, we paid $270 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 7.4% increase in our dividend to $1.16 per share on an annualized basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid dividends of $3.6 billion. In July 2023, our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.29 per share, which was paid in October 2023. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. 32 Table of Contents Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Debt Subject to Cross-Guarantees Comcast $ 91.6 $ 88.4 NBCUniversal (a) 1.6 1.6 Comcast Cable (a) 0.9 0.9 94.1 90.9 Debt Subject to One-Way Guarantees Sky 4.4 5.2 Other (a) 0.1 0.1 4.5 5.3 Debt Not Guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 3.4 3.5 Other 1.4 1.3 4.8 4.8 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (6.2) (6.2) Total debt $ 97.3 $ 94.8 (a) NBCUniversal Media, LLC (“NBCUniversal”), Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (“Comcast Cable”) and Comcast Holdings Corporation (“Comcast Holdings”), which is included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees, are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 6 for additional information. Cross-Guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $134 billion and $128 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $18 billion and $30 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. One-Way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky Limited (“Sky ”) , including all of its senior notes, and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. 33 Table of Contents Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $102 billion and $97 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $16 billion and $28 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Following the change in presentation of our segment operating results in the first quarter of 2023, we reassessed our reporting units related to goodwill and concluded that our reporting units are the same as our reportable business segments. See Note 2 for additional information. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We assessed goodwill for impairment in connection with our change in segment presentation in the first quarter of 2023. Based on our assessment, no impairment was required, and the estimated fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values. In 2022, in connection with our annual impairment testing, we recorded an impairment of $8.1 billion related to goodwill in our Sky reporting unit (See Note 7). In preparing this assessment, we estimated the fair value of the Sky reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis involved significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business, including the estimated impact of macroeconomic conditions in the Sky territories, as well as the selection of the discount rate, which increased by 125 basis points compared to the prior analysis. When analyzing the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model, we also considered multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions. Changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our.” Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “goal,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing on a per subscriber basis, which could adversely affect our video businesses • the success of our businesses depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and our businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of international transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect our businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • a cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1:

Comcast Corporation NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheets were derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior year periods to conform to classifications used in 2023. See Note 2 for a discussion of the changes in our presentation of segment operating results. Note 2: Segment Information Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our presentation of segment operating results around our two primary businesses: Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. Connectivity & Platforms: Contains our broadband and wireless connectivity businesses operated under the Xfinity and Comcast brands in the United States and under the Sky brand in certain territories in Europe (the “Connectivity & Platforms markets”). Also includes our video services businesses and the operations of our Sky-branded entertainment television channels in the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Our Connectivity & Platforms business is reported in two reportable business segments: • Residential Connectivity & Platforms Segment: Includes our residential broadband and wireless connectivity services, residential and business video services, advertising sales and Sky channels. Revenue is generated primarily from customers that subscribe to our services and from the sale of advertising and wireless devices. • Business Services Connectivity Segment: Includes our connectivity services for small business locations in the United States, which include broadband, voice and wireless services, as well as our solutions for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and our small business connectivity service offerings for international locations. Revenue is generated primarily from customers that subscribe to our services. Content & Experiences: Contains our media and entertainment businesses that develop, produce, and distribute entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences and that own and operate theme parks in the United States and Asia. Our Content & Experiences business is reported in three reportable business segments: • Media Segment: Includes primarily NBCUniversal ’ s television and streaming business, including national and regional cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; and Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service. Also includes international networks, including most of the Sky Sports channels, and other digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the distribution of our television and streaming programming and from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and other digital properties. • Studios Segment: Includes primarily our NBCUniversal and Sky film and television studio production and distribution operations. Revenue is generated primarily from licensing our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally; and from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. • Theme Parks Segment: Includes primarily the operations of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; Osaka, Japan; and Beijing, China. Revenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Our other business interests consist primarily of Sky operations outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets, the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the operations of Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications formed in June 2022. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. Transactions between our Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences businesses, and between segments within the Content & Experiences business, generally include intercompany profit consistent with third-party transactions. The segments within our Connectivity & Platforms business use certain shared infrastructure, including the cable distribution network in the United States, and each segment is presented with its direct costs and an allocation of shared costs, as well as revenue from its customers. Our financial data by reportable business segment is presented in the tables below and has been updated to reflect our new segment presentation, including: (1) presentation of Cable Communications results in the Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments and (2) presentation of Sky ’ s results across the segments within the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences businesses, and Corporate and Other. We do not present asset information for our reportable business segments as this information is not used to allocate resources and capital.

The most significant of these transactions include distribution revenue in Media related to fees from Residential Connectivity & Platforms for the rights to distribute television programming and content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. A summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.

The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 6: Investments and Variable Interest Entities Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ ( 80 ) $ ( 413 ) $ 405 $ ( 280 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net ( 38 ) ( 321 ) ( 44 ) ( 205 ) Other income (loss), net 133 ( 162 ) 261 ( 224 ) Investment and other income (loss), net $ 15 $ ( 897 ) $ 622 $ ( 709 ) The amount of unrealized gains (losses), net recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period was $( 41 ) million and $( 333 ) million, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains (losses), net recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period was $( 66 ) million and $( 251 ) million, respectively.

Atairos Atairos is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) that follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $ 28 million and $ 26 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our investment in Atairos, inclusive of certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf and classified as advances within other investments, was $ 4.7 billion and $ 4.3 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, our remaining unfunded capital commitment was $ 1.5 billion. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our collateralized obligation were each $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair values were based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheets in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method and, as a result, is less than its fair value. 12 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Other Investments Other investments include investments in certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, which are generally accounted for at amortized cost. These short-term instruments totaled $ 162 million and $ 304 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. Proceeds from short-term instruments for the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $ 304 million and there were no proceeds for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Purchases of short-term instruments for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $ 162 million and $ 1.0 billion, respectively. Consolidated Variable Interest Entity Universal Beijing Resort We own a 30 % interest in a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”), which opened in September 2021. Universal Beijing Resort is a consolidated VIE with the remaining interest owned by a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies. The construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. As of June 30, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $ 3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $ 3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of June 30, 2023, our condensed consolidated balance sheets included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 7.8 billion and $ 7.1 billion, respectively.

Consolidated revenue increased for the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by increases in the Content & Experiences business and in Corporate and Other. Consolidated revenue decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in the Content & Experiences business, partially offset by an increase in Corporate and Other. Revenue for our reportable business segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” 15 Table of Contents Consolidated costs and expenses , excluding depreciation and amortization expense, remained consistent with the prior year period for the three months ended June 30, 2023 driven by increases in the Content & Experiences business and in Corporate and Other, offset by a decrease in the Connectivity & Platforms business. Consolidated costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2023, driven by decreases in the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences businesses, partially offset by an increase in Corporate and Other. Costs and expenses for our reportable business segments and our corporate operations and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to increased depreciation at our theme parks. Consolidated depreciation and amortization increased for the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the amortization of software, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $572 million and $1.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and $568 million and $1.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively . Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated interest expense increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to higher weighted-average interest rates and increases in average debt outstanding. Consolidated investment and other income (loss), net increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ (80) $ (413) $ 405 $ (280) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net (38) (321) (44) (205) Other income (loss), net 133 (162) 261 (224) Total investment and other income (loss), net $ 15 $ (897) $ 622 $ (709) The chang es in investment and other income (loss), net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 were primarily due to equity in net income (losses) of investees, net driven by our investment in Atairos, as well as due to changes in other income (loss), net and realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $(23) million and $501 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and $(454) million and $(376) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The change in other income (loss), net for the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily resulted from gains on insurance contracts compared to losses in the prior year period and foreign exchange remeasurement losses in the prior year period compared to gains in the current year period. The change in other income (loss), net for the six months ended June 30, 2023 primarily resulted from foreign exchange remeasurement losses in the prior year period compared to gains in the current year period, gains on insurance contracts compared to losses in the prior year period and increased interest income compared to the prior year period. The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses on marketable and nonmarketable securities in the prior year period. The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses on marketable securities in the prior year period. Consolidated income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The increases in income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 were primarily driven by higher income before income taxes. Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests changed f or the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared with the same periods in 2022 primarily due to lower losses at Universal Beijing Resort as a result of increased operations in the current year periods, partially offset by losses in our Xumo streaming platform joint venture in the current year periods. 16 Table of Contents Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information.

We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects the year-over-year basis point change. (b) Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 27 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts. We continue to focus on growing our higher-margin connectivity businesses while managing overall operating costs. We also continue to invest in our network to support higher-speed broadband offerings and to expand the number of homes and businesses passed. Our customer relationships growth has slowed primarily reflecting continued low domestic household move levels and an increasingly competitive environment. We believe our residential connectivity revenue will increase as a result of growth in average domestic broadband revenue per customer, as well as increases in domestic wireless and international connectivity revenue. At the same time, we expect continued declines in video revenue as a result of domestic customer net losses due to shifting video consumption patterns and the competitive environment, although customer net losses typically partially mitigate the impact of continued rate increases on programming expenses. We also expect continued declines in other revenue in wireline voice revenue. Global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations. In addition, currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the British pound and euro impacted our Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment results during the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the prior year period. We believe our Business Services Connectivity segment will continue to grow by offering competitive services, including to medium-sized and enterprise customers. 17 Table of Contents Connectivity & Platforms Customer Metrics Net Additions / (Losses) June 30, Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (in thousands) 2023 2022 (d) 2023 2022 2023 2022 (d) Customer Relationships Domestic Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships (a) 31,761 31,955 (65) (38) (100) 146 International Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships (a) 17,884 17,788 (167) (120) (55) (242) Business Services Connectivity customer relationships (b) 2,635 2,608 5 16 10 35 Total Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships 52,280 52,351 (228) (143) (145) (62) Domestic Broadband Residential customers 29,796 29,826 (20) (10) (17) 243 Business customers 2,509 2,497 1 13 3 24 Total domestic broadband customers 32,305 32,323 (19) 3 (14) 267 Domestic Wireless Total domestic wireless lines (c) 5,984 4,615 316 317 671 635 Domestic Video Total domestic video customers 14,985 17,144 (543) (521) (1,157) (1,032) (a) Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships generally represent the number of residential customer locations that subscribe to at least one of our services. International Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships represent customers receiving Sky services in the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Previously reported total Sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of December 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships receiving Sky services outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Because each of our services includes a variety of product tiers, which may change from time to time, net additions or losses in any one period will reflect a mix of customers at various tiers. (b) Business Services Connectivity customer metrics are gener ally counted based on the number of locations receiving services, including locations within our distribution system in the United States, as well as locations outside of our distribution system both in the United States and internationally. Certain arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system are also generally counted based on the number of locations served. (c) Domestic wireless lines represent the number of residential and business customers ’ wireless devices. An individual customer relationship may have multiple wireless lines. (d) Customer metrics for 2022 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certain customers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. These changes in methodology were not material to any period presented. Three Months Ended June 30, Change Constant Currency Change (a) Six Months Ended June 30, Change Constant Currency Change (a) 2023 2022 % % 2023 2022 % % Average monthly total Connectivity & Platforms revenue per customer relationship $ 129.53 $ 129.30 0.2 % — % $ 128.97 $ 129.96 (0.8) % — % Average monthly total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 53.10 $ 50.84 4.4 % 4.4 % $ 52.33 $ 50.40 3.8 % 4.2 % (a) Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 27 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts. Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business customers, as well as changes in advertising and other revenue and in foreign currency exchange rates. While revenue from our individual service offerings is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses. 18 Table of Contents Connectivity & Platforms — Supplemental Costs and Expenses Information Connectivity & Platforms supplemental costs and expenses information in the table below is presented on an aggregate basis across the Connectivity & Platforms segments as the segments use certain shared infrastructure, including the cable distribution network in the United States.

Domestic broadband revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to increases in average rates. Domestic wireless revenue consists of revenue from sales of wireless services and devices, including handsets, tablets and smart watches, to residential customers in the United States. Domestic wireless revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to increases in the number of customer lines. International connectivity revenue consists of revenue from sales of broadband services, including equipment and installation services, wireless services and wireless devices to residential customers in the Connectivity & Platforms markets in Europe, as well as commission revenue related to sales of third-party DTC streaming services. International connectivity revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due to increases in wireless revenue, resulting from increases in sales of wireless devices and wireless services, and in broadband revenue. Wireless and broadband revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency in the six months ended June 30, 2023. Video revenue consists of revenue from sales of video services to residential and business customers across the Connectivity & Platforms markets, including equipment and installation services. Video revenue includes pay-per-view and other transactional revenue and franchise fees, as well as revenue from sales of certain hardware, including Sky Glass smart televisions. Video r evenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due to declines in the number of video customers, partially offset by increases in average rates. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2023 also includes the negative impact of foreign currency. Advertising revenue includes revenue from the sale of advertising across our platforms in the Connectivity & Platforms markets, including advertising as part of our distribution agreements with linear television networks in the United States, and advertising on Sky-branded entertainment television channels and digital properties. Advertising also includes revenue where we represent the sales efforts of third parties and from our advanced advertising businesses. Advertising revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to declines in domestic political advertising and overall market weakness in the current year periods. Other revenue includes revenue in the Connectivity & Platforms markets from sales of wireline voice services to residential customers; our residential security and automation services businesses; the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers; the distribution of our Sky-branded entertainment television channels on third-party platforms; commissions from electronic retailing networks; and certain billing and collection fees.

Residential Connectivity & Platforms Segment – Costs and Expenses Programming expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to declines in the number of domestic video subscribers, partially offset by domestic contractual rate increases and increases in programming expenses for international sports channels. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2023 also includes the impact of foreign currency. Other expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to decreased spending on marketing and promotion, lower technical and support costs, a decrease in fees paid to third-party channels relating to advertising sales, and lower customer service expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increased direct product costs associated with our wireless service resulting from increases in device sales and the number of customers receiving our wireless service. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2023 also includes the impact of foreign currency. 20 Table of Contents Business Services Connectivity Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change (in millions) 2023 2022 % 2023 2022 % Revenue $ 2,292 $ 2,203 4.0 % $ 4,575 $ 4,375 4.6 % Costs and expenses 970 941 3.1 1,921 1,879 2.3 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,322 $ 1,263 4.7 % $ 2,654 $ 2,496 6.3 % Business services connectivity revenue primarily consists of revenue from our connectivity service offerings for small business locations, which include broadband, voice and wireless services, as well as our solutions for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises.

We operate our Media segment as a combined television and streaming business. We expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in paid subscribers and advertising revenue at Peacock. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing at Peacock, with such costs increasing in 2023. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Olympics, Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup in 2022. Global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations. In addition, currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the British pound and euro impacted revenue and programming and production costs at our international networks during the six months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the prior year period. 21 Table of Contents Our Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content & Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. We continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks. Our results in prior periods were impacted by temporary restrictions and closures at our international theme parks due to COVID-19. In addition, currency exchange rates have impacted our international theme park results as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.

This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Connectivity & Platforms, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Connectivity & Platforms business, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the businesses, and we believe they are helpful for investors because such measures present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate their underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. 27 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Connectivity & Platforms Constant Currency Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 (in millions) As Reported Effects of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Amounts As Reported Effects of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Amounts Revenue Residential Connectivity & Platforms $ 18,131 $ 31 $ 18,162 $ 36,472 $ (318) $ 36,154 Business Services Connectivity 2,203 — 2,203 4,375 (1) 4,374 Total Connectivity & Platforms revenue $ 20,335 $ 30 $ 20,365 $ 40,846 $ (318) $ 40,528 Adjusted EBITDA Residential Connectivity & Platforms $ 6,733 $ 3 $ 6,736 $ 13,344 $ (56) $ 13,288 Business Services Connectivity 1,263 (1) 1,262 2,496 — 2,496 Total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA $ 7,995 $ 3 $ 7,998 $ 15,840 $ (55) $ 15,785 Adjusted EBITDA Margin Residential Connectivity & Platforms 37.1 % - bps 37.1 % 36.6 % 20 bps 36.8 % Business Services Connectivity 57.3 - bps 57.3 57.1 - bps 57.1 Total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA margin 39.3 % - bps 39.3 % 38.8 % 10 bps 38.9 % Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 As Reported Effects of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Amounts As Reported Effects of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Amounts Average monthly total Connectivity & Platforms revenue per customer relationship $ 129.30 $ 0.19 $ 129.49 $ 129.96 $ (1.01) $ 128.95 Average monthly total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 50.84 $ 0.02 $ 50.86 $ 50.40 $ (0.18) $ 50.22 Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 (in millions) As Reported Effects of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Amounts As Reported Effects of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Amounts Costs and expenses Programming $ 4,679 $ 11 $ 4,690 $ 9,563 $ (92) $ 9,471 Technical and support 1,916 2 1,918 3,865 (25) 3,840 Direct product costs 1,329 5 1,334 2,667 (62) 2,605 Marketing and promotion 1,296 3 1,299 2,628 (23) 2,605 Customer service 720 1 721 1,455 (12) 1,443 Other 2,399 5 2,404 4,829 (49) 4,780 Total Connectivity & Platforms costs and expenses $ 12,339 $ 28 $ 12,367 $ 25,007 $ (263) $ 24,744 28 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Residential Connectivity & Platforms Constant Currency Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 (in millions, except per customer data) As Reported Effects of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Amounts As Reported Effects of Foreign Currency Constant Currency Amounts Revenue Domestic broadband $ 6,107 $ — $ 6,107 $ 12,158 $ — $ 12,158 Domestic wireless 722 — 722 1,399 — 1,399 International connectivity 791 5 796 1,631 (73) 1,558 Total residential connectivity 7,620 5 7,625 15,187 (73) 15,114 Video 7,793 19 7,812 15,795 (172) 15,623 Advertising 1,112 3 1,115 2,185 (32) 2,153 Other 1,607 3 1,610 3,305 (41) 3,264 Total revenue 18,131 31 18,162 36,472 (318) 36,154 Costs and Expenses Programming 4,679 11 4,690 9,563 (92) 9,471 Other 6,720 16 6,736 13,565 (170) 13,395 Total costs and expenses 11,399 27 11,426 23,128 (262) 22,866 Adjusted EBITDA $ 6,733 $ 3 $ 6,736 $ 13,344 $ (56) $ 13,288 Other Adjustments From time to time, we present adjusted information, such as revenue, to exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Six Months Ended June 30, (in billions) 2023 2022 Cash provided by operating activities $ 14.4 $ 13.6 Cash used in investing activities $ (7.5) $ (6.8) Cash used in financing activities $ (4.5) $ (8.6) (in billions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 7.1 $ 4.7 Short-term and long-term debt $ 97.5 $ 94.8 Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cas h equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program generally provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. As of June 30, 2023, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. 29 Table of Contents Operating Activit ies Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income $ 12,355 $ 11,936 Depreciation and amortization 7,315 7,016 Noncash share-based compensation 668 675 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (1,975) (1,715) Payments of interest (1,823) (1,644) Payments of income taxes (2,384) (2,841) Proceeds from investments and other 269 155 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,426 $ 13,584 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including the impacts of sporting events, and the recognition of deferred revenue. The increase in payments of interest for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to cash proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps related to the collateralized obligation in the prior year period. The decrease in payments of income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to higher payments in the prior year relating to the preceding tax year. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased capital expenditures and increased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development. The se increases were partially offset by de creased purchases of short-term investments, increased proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments and decreased cash paid related to the construction of Universal Beijing Resort in the current year period. Capital expenditures, which are our most significant recurring investing activity, increased for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily reflecting increased spending by the Connectivity & Platforms businesses primarily o n scalable infrastructure and line extensions, and increased spending on the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher proceeds from borrow ings in the current year period and a de crease in the repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, partially offset by higher repurchases and repayments of debt and repayments of short-term borrowings in the current year period. In May 2023, we issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes maturing between 2029 and 2064, of which $2.9 billion was used to purchase senior notes maturing in 2024 and 2025. In February 2023, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes maturing in 2033 and an amount equal to the net proceeds from this issuance is intended to finance or refinance one or more green projects, assets or activities that meet certain specified eligibility criteria. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we made total debt repayments of $3.0 billion, including the $2.9 billion purchase of senior notes. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outst an ding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased a total of 103.1 million shares of our Clas s A common stock for $4.0 billion. As of June 30, 2023, we had $12.0 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase program. Under this authorizati on, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions. 30 Table of Contents In addition, we paid $227 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 7.4% increase in our dividend to $1.16 per share on an annualized basis. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we paid dividends of $2.4 billion. In May 2023, our Board of Directors approved our second quarter dividend of $0.29 per share, which was paid in July 2023. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Debt Subject to Cross-Guarantees Comcast $ 91.8 $ 88.4 NBCUniversal (a) 1.6 1.6 Comcast Cable (a) 0.9 0.9 94.4 90.9 Debt Subject to One-Way Guarantees Sky 4.5 5.2 Other (a) 0.1 0.1 4.7 5.3 Debt Not Guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 3.4 3.5 Other 1.2 1.3 4.6 4.8 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (6.2) (6.2) Total debt $ 97.5 $ 94.8 (a) NBCUniversal Media, LLC (“NBCUniversal”), Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (“Comcast Cable”) and Comcast Holdings Corporation (“Comcast Holdings”), which is included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees, are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 6 for additional information. Cross-Guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. 31 Table of Contents As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $132 billion and $128 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $18 billion and $30 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. One-Way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky Limited (“Sky ”) , including all of its senior notes, and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $101 billion and $97 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $16 billion and $28 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Following the change in presentation of our segment operating results in the first quarter of 2023, we reassessed our reporting units related to goodwill and concluded that our reporting units are the same as our reportable business segments. See Note 2 for additional information. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We assessed goodwill for impairment in connection with our change in segment presentation in the first quarter of 2023. Based on our assessment, no impairment was required, and the estimated fair values of our new reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Exhibits 32 SIGNATURES 33 Explanatory Note This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our.” Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “goal,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’

STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior year period to conform to classifications used in 2023. See Note 2 for a discussion of the changes in our presentation of segment operating results. Note 2: Segment Information Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our presentation of segment operating results around our two primary businesses: Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. Connectivity & Platforms: Contains our broadband and wireless connectivity businesses operated under the Xfinity and Comcast brands in the United States and under the Sky brand in certain territories in Europe (the “Connectivity & Platforms markets”). Also includes our video services businesses and the operations of our Sky-branded entertainment television channels in the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Our Connectivity & Platforms business is reported in two reportable business segments: • Residential Connectivity & Platforms Segment: Includes our residential broadband and wireless connectivity services, residential and business video services, advertising sales and Sky channels. Revenue is generated primarily from customers that subscribe to our services and from the sale of advertising and wireless devices. • Business Services Connectivity Segment: Includes our connectivity services for small business locations in the United States, which include broadband, voice and wireless services, as well as our solutions for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and our small business connectivity service offerings for international locations. Revenue is generated primarily from customers that subscribe to our services. Content & Experiences: Contains our media and entertainment businesses that develop, produce, and distribute entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences and that own and operate theme parks in the United States and Asia. Our Content & Experiences business is reported in three reportable business segments: • Media Segment: Includes primarily NBCUniversal ’ s television and streaming business, including national and regional cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; and Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service. Also includes international networks, including most of the Sky Sports channels, and other digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the distribution of our television and streaming programming and from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and other digital properties. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation • Studios Segment: Includes primarily our NBCUniversal and Sky film and television studio production and distribution operations. Revenue is generated primarily from licensing our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally; and from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. • Theme Parks Segment: Includes primarily the operations of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; Osaka, Japan; and Beijing, China. Revenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks. Our other business interests consist primarily of Sky operations outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets, the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the operations of Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications formed in June 2022. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. Transactions between our Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences businesses, and between segments within the Content & Experiences business, generally include intercompany profit consistent with third-party transactions. The segments within our Connectivity & Platforms business use certain shared infrastructure, including the cable distribution network in the United States, and each segment is presented with its direct costs and an allocation of shared costs, as well as revenue from its customers. Our financial data by reportable business segment is presented in the tables below and has been updated to reflect our new segment presentation, including: (1) presentation of Cable Communications results in the Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments and (2) presentation of Sky ’ s results across the segments within the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences businesses, and Corporate and Other. We do not present asset information for our reportable business segments as this information is not used to allocate resources and capital.

The most significant of these transactions include distribution revenue in Media related to fees from Residential Connectivity & Platforms for the rights to distribute television programming and content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation A summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.

Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.

As of December 31, 2022, our debt had a carrying value of $ 94.8 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 86.9 billion. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Note 6: Investments and Variable Interest Entities Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 485 $ 133 Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net ( 6 ) 117 Other income (loss), net 128 ( 62 ) Investment and other income (loss), net $ 607 $ 188 The amount of unrealized gains (losses), net recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period was $( 24 ) million and $ 90 million, respectively. 10 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Investments (in millions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Equity method $ 6,211 $ 5,421 Marketable equity securities 91 96 Nonmarketable equity securities 1,623 1,653 Other investments 471 972 Total investments 8,396 8,142 Less: Current investments 98 402 Less: Investment securing collateralized obligation 464 490 Noncurrent investments $ 7,834 $ 7,250 Equity Me thod Investments The amount of cash distributions received from equity method investments presented within operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows in the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 20 million and $ 32 million, respectively. Atairos Atairos is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) that follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $ 14 million and $ 13 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our investment in Atairos, inclusive of certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf and classified as advances within other investments, was $ 4.8 billion and $ 4.3 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, our remaining unfunded capital commitment was $ 1.5 billion. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our collateralized obligation were each $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair values were based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method and, as a result, is less than its fair value. Other Investments Other investments include investments in certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, which are generally accounted for at amortized cost. There were no such investments as of March 31, 2023. These short-term instruments totaled $ 304 million as of December 31, 2022. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. Consolidated Variable Interest Entity Universal Beijing Resort We own a 30 % interest in a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”), which opened in September 2021. Universal Beijing Resort is a consolidated VIE with the remaining interest owned by a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies. The construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. As of March 31, 2023, Universal Beijing Resort had $ 3.6 billion of debt outstanding, including $ 3.2 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of March 31, 2023, our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 8.3 billion and $ 7.4 billion, respectively.

All amounts are presented under the new segment structure. Consolidated Operating Results Three Months Ended March 31, Change (in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 % Revenue $ 29,691 $ 31,010 (4.3) % Costs and Expenses: Programming and production 9,004 10,570 (14.8) Marketing and promotion 1,963 2,062 (4.8) Other operating and administrative 9,301 9,260 0.4 Depreciation 2,264 2,213 2.3 Amortization 1,513 1,335 13.3 Total costs and expenses 24,045 25,440 (5.5) Operating income 5,646 5,569 1.4 Interest expense (1,010) (993) 1.6 Investment and other income (loss), net 607 188 NM Income before income taxes 5,243 4,764 10.1 Income tax expense (1,476) (1,288) 14.6 Net income 3,767 3,476 8.4 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (67) (73) (8.4) Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 3,834 $ 3,549 8.0 % Basic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.91 $ 0.79 15.2 % Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.91 $ 0.78 16.7 % Adjusted EBITDA (a) $ 9,415 $ 9,150 2.9 % Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM. (a) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 25 for additional information, including our definition and our use of Adjusted EBITDA, and for a reconciliation from net income attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA. Consolidated revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by decreases in the Content & Experiences and Connectivity & Platforms businesses. Revenue for our reportable business segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated costs and expenses , excluding depreciation and amortization expense, decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by decreases in the Content & Experiences and Connectivity & Platforms businesses, partially offset by an increase in Corporate and Other. Costs and expenses for our reportable business segments and our corporate operations and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the amortization of software, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency. 14 Table of Contents Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $556 million and $592 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated interest expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to higher weighted-average interest rates. Consolidated investment and other income (loss), net increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 485 $ 133 Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net (6) 117 Other income (loss), net 128 (62) Total investment and other income (loss), net $ 607 $ 188 The chang e in investment and other income (loss), net was primarily due to our investment in Atairos and changes in other income (loss), net and realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $524 million and $78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The change in other income (loss), net for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the s ame period in 2022 primarily resulted from foreign exchange remeasurement losses in the prior year period, gains on insurance contracts compared to losses in the prior year period and increased interest income compared to the prior year period. The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily due to gains on nonmarketable securities in the prior year period, partially offset by losses on marketable securities in the prior year period. Consolidated income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily driven by higher income before income taxes. Consolidated net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests changed f or the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared with the same period in 2022 primarily due to lower losses at Universal Beijing Resort as a result of increased operations in the current year period, partially offset by losses in our Xumo streaming platform joint venture in the current year. 15 Table of Contents Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. See Note 2 for additional information on our reportable business segments. Connectivity & Platforms Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, Change Constant Currency Change (b) (in millions) 2023 2022 % % Revenue Residential Connectivity & Platforms $ 17,869 $ 18,340 (2.6) % (0.7) % Business Services Connectivity 2,283 2,172 5.1 5.2 Total Connectivity & Platforms revenue $ 20,153 $ 20,512 (1.8) % (0.1) % Adjusted EBITDA Residential Connectivity & Platforms $ 6,762 $ 6,611 2.3 % 3.2 % Business Services Connectivity 1,332 1,233 8.0 7.9 Total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,093 $ 7,844 3.2 % 3.9 % Adjusted EBITDA Margin (a) Residential Connectivity & Platforms 37.8 % 36.0 % 180 bps 140 bps Business Services Connectivity 58.3 56.8 150 bps 150 bps Total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA margin 40.2 % 38.2 % 200 bps 160 bps (a) Our Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our high-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects the year-over-year basis point change. (b) Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 25 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts. We continue to focus on growing our higher-margin connectivity businesses while managing overall operating costs. We also continue to invest in our network to support higher-speed broadband offerings and to expand the number of homes and businesses passed. Our customer relationships growth has slowed primarily reflecting continued low domestic household move levels and an increasingly competitive environment. We believe our residential connectivity revenue will increase as a result of growth in average domestic broadband revenue per customer, as well as increases in domestic wireless and international connectivity revenue. At the same time, we expect continued declines in video revenue as a result of domestic customer net losses due to shifting video consumption patterns and the competitive environment, although customer net losses typically partially mitigate the impact of continued rate increases on programming expenses. We also expect continued declines in other revenue in wireline voice revenue. Global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations. In addition, currency exchange rates have impacted our Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment results as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative primarily to the British pound and euro. We believe our Business Services Connectivity segment will continue to grow by offering competitive services, including to medium-sized and enterprise customers. 16 Table of Contents Connectivity & Platforms Customer Metrics Net Additions / (Losses) March 31, Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2023 2022 (d) 2023 2022 (d) Customer relationships Domestic Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships (a) 31,826 31,993 (34) 184 International Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships (a) 18,051 17,908 111 (122) Business Services Connectivity customer relationships (b) 2,630 2,592 5 19 Total Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships 52,507 52,494 82 81 Domestic broadband Residential customers 29,815 29,836 3 253 Business customers 2,508 2,485 2 12 Total domestic broadband customers 32,324 32,320 5 264 Domestic wireless Total domestic wireless lines (c) 5,668 4,298 355 318 Domestic video Total domestic video customers 15,528 17,664 (614) (512) (a) Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships generally represent the number of residential customer locations that subscribe to at least one of our services. International Residential Connectivity & Platforms customer relationships represent customers receiving Sky services in the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Previously reported total Sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of December 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships receiving Sky services outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets. Because each of our services includes a variety of product tiers, which may change from time to time, net additions or losses in any one period will reflect a mix of customers at various tiers. (b) Business Services Connectivity customer metrics are gener ally counted based on the number of locations receiving services, including locations within our distribution system in the United States, as well as locations outside of our distribution system both in the United States and internationally. Certain arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system are also generally counted based on the number of locations served. (c) Domestic wireless lines represent the number of residential and business customers ’ wireless devices. An individual customer relationship may have multiple wireless lines. (d) Customer metrics for 2022 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certain customers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. These changes in methodology were not material to any period presented. Three Months Ended March 31, Change Constant Currency Change (a) 2023 2022 % % Average monthly total Connectivity & Platforms revenue per customer relationship $ 128.04 $ 130.35 (1.8) % (0.1) % Average monthly total Connectivity & Platforms Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 51.42 $ 49.85 3.1 % 3.9 % (a) Constant currency is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 25 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of constant currency amounts. Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business customers, as well as changes in advertising and other revenue and in foreign currency exchange rates. While revenue from our individual service offerings is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses. 17 Table of Contents Connectivity & Platforms — Supplemental Costs and Expenses Information Connectivity & Platforms supplemental costs and expenses information in the table below is presented on an aggregate basis across the Connectivity & Platforms segments as the segments use certain shared infrastructure, including the cable distribution network in the United States.

Domestic broadband revenue also includes revenue related to our customers ’ use of Flex streaming devices and commission revenue related to sales of third-party direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) streaming services . Domestic broadband revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to an increase in average rates. Domestic wireless revenue consists of revenue from sales of wireless services and devices, including handsets, tablets and smart watches, to residential customers in the United States. Domestic wireless revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to an increase in the number of customer lines and device sales. International connectivity revenue consists of revenue from sales of broadband services, including equipment and installation services, wireless services and wireless devices to residential customers in the Connectivity & Platforms markets in Europe, as well as commission revenue related to sales of third-party DTC streaming services. International connectivity revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to increases in wireless revenue, resulting from increases in sales of wireless devices and wireless services, and broadband revenue. Wireless and broadband revenues were negatively impacted by foreign currency. Video revenue consists of revenue from sales of video services to residential and business customers across the Connectivity & Platforms markets, including equipment and installation services. Video includes pay-per-view and other transactional revenue and franchise fees, as well as revenue from sales of certain hardware, including Sky Glass smart televisions. Video r evenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to a decline in the number of video customers and the negative impact of foreign currency, partially offset by an increase in average rates. Advertising revenue includes revenue from the sale of advertising across our platforms in the Connectivity & Platforms markets, including advertising as part of our distribution agreements with linear television networks in the United States, and advertising on Sky-branded entertainment television channels and digital properties. Advertising also includes revenue where we represent the sales efforts of third parties and from our advanced advertising businesses. Advertising revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to overall market weakness, the negative impact of foreign currency and a decline in domestic political advertising in the current year period. Other revenue includes revenue in the Connectivity & Platforms markets from sales of wireline voice services to residential customers; our residential security and automation services businesses; the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers; the distribution of our Sky-branded entertainment television channels on third-party platforms; commissions from electronic retailing networks; and certain billing and collection fees. Other revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to a decrease in voice revenue driven by a decline in the number of residential wireline voice customers and a decrease due to the negative impact of foreign currency. Residential Connectivity & Platforms Segment – Costs and Expenses Programming expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to a decline in the number of domestic video subscribers and the impact of foreign currency, partially offset by domestic contractual rate increases and an increase in programming expenses for international sports channels. Other expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency, decreased spending on marketing and promotion, lower technical and support costs, and a decrease in fees paid to third-party channels relating to advertising sales. These decreases were partially offset by increased direct product costs associated with our wireless service resulting from increases in device sales and the number of customers receiving the service. 19 Table of Contents Business Services Connectivity Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, Change (in millions) 2023 2022 % Revenue $ 2,283 $ 2,172 5.1 % Costs and expenses 952 938 1.4 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,332 $ 1,233 8.0 % Business services connectivity revenue primarily consists of revenue from our connectivity service offerings for small business locations, which include broadband, voice and wireless services, as well as our solutions for medium-sized customers and larger enterprises. Business services connectivity revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to an increase in revenue from small business customers driven by an increase in average rates, and an increase in revenue from medium-sized and enterprise customers. Business services connectivity costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to an increase in direct product costs.

We operate our Media segment as a combined television and streaming business. We expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in Peacock paid subscribers and advertising revenue. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing at Peacock, with such costs increasing in 2023. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Olympics, Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup in 2022. Global economic conditions and consumer sentiment have in the past, and may continue to, adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations. In addition, currency exchange rates have impacted revenue and programming and production costs at our international networks as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative primarily to the British pound and euro. Our Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content & Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. 20 Table of Contents We continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks. Our results in prior periods were impacted by temporary restrictions and closures at our international theme parks due to COVID-19. In addition, currency exchange rates have impacted our international theme park results as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly against the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.

A significant portion of this revenue comes from the Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment. International networks revenue in creased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to an increase in revenue associated with the distribution of sports channels, partially offset by a decrease from the negative impact of foreign currency. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from the licensing of our owned content and technology, and revenue generated by various digital properties. Other revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to a decrease in content licensing. * * * Revenue included $685 million and $472 million related to Peacock for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We had 22 million and 13 million paid subscribers of Peacock as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Peacock paid subscribers represent customers from which Peacock receives a subscription fee on a retail or wholesale basis. Paid subscribers do not include certain customers that receive Peacock as part of bundled services where Peacock does not receive fees. Media Segment – Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs include the amortization of owned and licensed programming, including sports rights, direct production costs, production overhead, on-air talent costs and costs associated with the distribution of our programming to third-party networks and other distribution platforms. Programming and production costs decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to costs associated with our broadcast of the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl in the prior year period, partially offset by higher programming costs at Peacock. International sports programming costs remained consistent with the prior year period driven by a decrease due to the impact of foreign currency, offset by the shift of certain European football matches and the related programming expense to the first half of 2023 due to timing of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Marketing and promotion expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with promoting our networks, Peacock and other digital properties. Marketing and promotion expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to lower costs related to marketing for entertainment programming and for Peacock. Other expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses. Other expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to an increase in costs related to Peacock. * * * Costs and expenses included $1.4 billion and $928 million related to Peacock for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 22 Table of Contents Studios Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, Change (in millions) 2023 2022 % Revenue Content licensing $ 2,344 $ 2,429 (3.5) % Theatrical 319 168 90.1 Other 292 310 (5.6) Total revenue 2,956 2,907 1.7 Costs and Expenses Programming and production 2,101 2,122 (1.0) Marketing and promotion 397 327 21.6 Other 180 213 (15.7) Total costs and expenses 2,678 2,662 0.6 Adjusted EBITDA $ 277 $ 245 13.3 % Studios Seg ment – Revenue Content licensing revenue relates to the licensing of our owned film and television content in the United States and internationally to television networks and DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-per-view services provided by multichannel video providers and OTT service providers. Content licensing revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios under licensing agreements, partially offset by the timing of when content was made available by our film studios. Theatrical revenue relates to the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters. Theatrical revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the strong performances of recent releases, including Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and M3GAN . Other revenue consists primarily of the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products, as well as the production and licensing of live stage plays and the distribution of content produced by third parties. Studios Segment – Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs include the amortization of capitalized film and television production and acquisition costs; residuals and participations expenses; and distribution expenses. The costs associated with producing film and television content have generally increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future. Programming and production costs decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to lower costs associated with content licensing sales, partially offset by higher costs associated with theatrical releases in the current year period. Marketing and promotion expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with advertising for our theatrical releases. Marketing and promotion expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher spending on recent and upcoming theatrical film releases in the current year period. Other expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other overhead expenses.

Theme parks revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 driven by an increase at our international theme parks, which had COVID-19 related restrictions in the prior year period, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency, and an increase in our domestic theme parks primarily due to higher attendance driven by the opening of Super Nintendo World at our theme park in Hollywood in the current year period. Theme parks segment costs and expenses consist primarily of theme park operations, including repairs and maintenance and related administrative expenses; food, beverage and merchandise costs; labor costs; and sales and marketing costs. Theme parks costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher costs associated with increased guest attendance.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP. 25 Table of Contents Reconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 3,834 $ 3,549 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (67) (73) Income tax expense 1,476 1,288 Interest expense 1,010 993 Investment and other (income) loss, net (607) (188) Depreciation 2,264 2,213 Amortization 1,513 1,335 Adjustments (a) (8) 33 Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,415 $ 9,150 (a) Amounts represent the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, including costs related to our investment portfolio. Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Connectivity & Platforms, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Connectivity & Platforms business, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the businesses, and we believe they are helpful for investors because such measures present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate their underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Three Months Ended March 31, (in billions) 2023 2022 Cash provided by operating activities $ 7.2 $ 7.3 Cash used in investing activities $ (3.4) $ (2.6) Cash used in financing activities $ (3.1) $ (4.5) (in billions) March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5.5 $ 4.7 Short-term and long-term debt $ 95.5 $ 94.8 27 Table of Contents Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cas h equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program generally provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. As of March 31, 2023, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. Operating Activit ies Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2023 2022 Operating income $ 5,646 $ 5,569 Depreciation and amortization 3,777 3,548 Noncash share-based compensation 359 376 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (1,731) (1,475) Payments of interest (766) (747) Payments of income taxes (148) (90) Proceeds from investments and other 91 75 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,228 $ 7,257 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 was primarily related to the timing of sporting events, including the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl in the prior year period, and the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which impacted the timing of collections on receivables, recognition of deferred revenue and amortization, and related payments for our film and television costs. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased capital expenditures, increased cash paid for intangible assets related to software development and increased purchases of investments in the current year period. The se increases were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments and decreased cash paid related to the construction of Universal Beijing Resort in the current year period. Capital expenditures, which are our most significant recurring investing activity, increased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, primarily reflecting increased spending o n scalable infrastructure and line extensions by the Connectivity & Platforms businesses and increased spending on the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to a de crease in the repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, and higher proceeds from borrow ings in the current year period, partially offset by repayments of short-term borrowings in the current year period. In February 2023, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes maturing in 2033. An amount equal to the net proceeds from these notes is intended to finance or refinance one or more green projects, assets or activities that meet certain specified eligibility criteria. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outst an ding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. 28 Table of Contents Share Repurchases and Dividends During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased a total of 52.5 million shares of our Clas s A common stock for $2.0 billion. As of March 31, 2023, we had $14.0 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase program. Under this authorizati on, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions. In addition, we paid $177 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2023, we paid dividends of $1.2 billion. and our Board of Directors approved an 7.4% increase in our dividend to $1.16 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.29 per share, which was paid in April 2023. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.

The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 6 for additional information. Cross-Guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. 29 Table of Contents The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $130 billion and $128 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $18 billion and $30 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. One-Way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky Limited (“Sky ”) , including all of its senior notes, and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $99 billion and $97 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $16 billion and $28 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Following the change in presentation of our segment operating results in the first quarter of 2023, we reassessed our reporting units related to goodwill and concluded that our reporting units are the same as our reportable business segments. See Note 2 for additional information. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We assessed goodwill for impairment in connection with our change in segment presentation in the first quarter of 2023. Based on our assessment, no impairment was required, and the estimated fair values of our new reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have evaluated the information required under this item that was disclosed in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and there have been no material changes to this information.

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “NBCUniversal;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “goal,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC. Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • a cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in five reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Cable Communications is a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and other services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand. We also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Media consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s television and streaming platforms, including national, regional and international cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; and Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service. Studios consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s film and television studio production and distribution operations. Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; Osaka, Japan; and Beijing, China. Sky is one of Europe ’ s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Our financial data by reportable segment is presented in the tables below. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 16,539 $ 7,452 $ 1,945 $ 2,021 $ 369 NBCUniversal Media 5,230 583 198 25 63 Studios 3,163 537 11 1 4 Theme Parks 2,064 819 266 450 15 Headquarters and Other 22 ( 199 ) 121 137 46 Eliminations (a) ( 909 ) ( 59 ) — — — NBCUniversal 9,570 1,681 596 614 129 Sky (c) 4,253 701 722 96 183 Corporate and Other 147 ( 378 ) 70 59 87 Eliminations (a) ( 660 ) 26 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 29,849 $ 9,482 $ 3,333 $ 2,791 $ 769 Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 16,115 $ 7,069 $ 1,965 $ 1,673 $ 370 NBCUniversal Media 6,770 997 248 20 38 Studios 2,407 179 14 1 3 Theme Parks 1,449 434 213 122 8 Headquarters and Other 28 ( 248 ) 115 87 36 Eliminations (a) ( 654 ) ( 12 ) — — — NBCUniversal 10,001 1,349 591 229 85 Sky 4,988 971 884 160 221 Corporate and Other 65 ( 335 ) 38 80 48 Eliminations (a) ( 871 ) ( 98 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 30,298 $ 8,957 $ 3,477 $ 2,142 $ 723 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 49,680 $ 22,172 $ 5,850 $ 5,164 $ 1,113 NBCUniversal Media 17,427 3,080 698 59 152 Studios 8,885 783 34 3 12 Theme Parks 5,428 1,902 814 990 30 Headquarters and Other 46 ( 528 ) 363 331 122 Eliminations (a) ( 2,474 ) ( 98 ) — — — NBCUniversal 29,311 5,138 1,909 1,383 315 Sky (c) 13,529 2,185 2,402 373 506 Corporate and Other 549 ( 944 ) 188 141 219 Eliminations (a) ( 2,196 ) ( 93 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 90,874 $ 28,459 $ 10,349 $ 7,062 $ 2,152 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 47,922 $ 20,972 $ 5,845 $ 4,739 $ 1,022 NBCUniversal Media 16,955 3,847 749 49 112 Studios 7,027 833 39 2 9 Theme Parks 3,163 593 615 348 23 Headquarters and Other 65 ( 643 ) 356 184 93 Eliminations (a) ( 2,230 ) ( 238 ) — — — NBCUniversal 24,981 4,392 1,759 584 238 Sky 15,205 1,895 2,524 615 633 Corporate and Other 246 ( 876 ) 95 208 113 Eliminations (a) ( 2,304 ) ( 87 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 86,049 $ 26,297 $ 10,222 $ 6,146 $ 2,006 (a) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. A summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.

As of December 31, 2021, our debt had a carrying value of $ 94.8 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 109.3 billion. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Note 6: Significant Transactions Acquisitions In October 2021, we acquired Masergy, a provider of software-defined networking and cloud platforms for global enterprises, for total cash consideration of $ 1.2 billion. The acquisition accelerates our growth in serving large and mid-sized companies, particularly U.S.-based organizations with multi-site global enterprises. Masergy’s results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date and are reported in our Cable Communications segment. We have recorded Masergy’s assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values with $ 845 million recorded to goodwill and the remainder primarily attributed to software and customer relationship intangible assets. The acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations. 10 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 7: Investments and Variable Interest Entities Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ ( 242 ) $ 602 $ ( 523 ) $ 1,696 Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net ( 2 ) 106 ( 207 ) 532 Other income (loss), net ( 21 ) 59 ( 245 ) 146 Investment and other income (loss), net $ ( 266 ) $ 766 $ ( 975 ) $ 2,374 The amount of unrealized gains (losses), net recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period were $( 43 ) million and $( 165 ) million, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains (losses), net recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period were $( 283 ) million and $ 91 million, respectively.

Atairos Atairos is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) that follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $ 39 million and $ 36 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our investment in Atairos, inclusive of certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf and classified as advances within other investments, was $ 4.3 billion and $ 4.7 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, our remaining unfunded capital commitment was $ 1.5 billion. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our collateralized obligation were $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Other Investments Other investments also includes investments in certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, which are generally accounted for at amortized cost. These short-term instruments totaled $ 977 million as of September 30, 2022 and there were no such investments as of December 31, 2021. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. Consolidated Variable Interest Entity Universal Beijing Resort We own a 30 % interest in a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”), which opened in September 2021. Universal Beijing Resort is a consolidated VIE with the remaining interest owned by a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies. The construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. As of September 30, 2022, Universal Beijing Resort had $ 3.3 billion of debt outstanding, including $ 3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of September 30, 2022, our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 8.1 billion and $ 7.2 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.

The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. When performing this analysis, we also considered multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions. The decline in fair value primarily resulted from an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions in the Sky territories. In connection with this assessment, in the third quarter of 2022, we also recorded impairments of intangible assets related to our Sky segment, which primarily related to customer relationship assets. These impairments totaled $ 485 million and are presented in goodwill and long-lived asset impairments in the consolidated statement of income.

Note 10: Supplemental Financial Information Income Taxes In the third quarter of 2022, a state tax law change was enacted that resulted in a decrease to our net deferred tax liabilities of $ 286 million, with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense. In the second quarter of 2021, tax law changes were enacted in the United Kingdom that resulted in an increase to our net deferred tax liabilities of $ 498 million, with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The goodwill impairment in the third quarter of 2022 (see Note 8) was primarily not deductible for tax purposes.

The redeemable subsidiary preferred stock was presented in redeemable noncontrolling interests. Contingencies We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. COVID-19 has impacted our businesses in a number of ways, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. The most significant continuing impacts have resulted from temporary restrictions and closures at our international theme parks. The continuing effects of COVID-19, in addition to worsening U.S., European and global economic conditions and consumer sentiment, may adversely impact demand for our products and services, including advertising, and our results of operations over the near to medium term. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates have impacted our results of operations in our Sky and Theme Parks segments as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased depreciation at NBCUniversal driven by the opening of Universal Beijing Resort, increased amortization of software at Sky and increased depreciation and amortization related to other business initiatives, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency at Sky. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $517 million and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $603 million and $1.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated Goodwill and Long-lived Asset Impairments Goodwill and long-lived asset impairments included charges related to our Sky segment totaling $8.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 recognized in connection with our annual impairment assessment. The impairments primarily reflected an increased discount rate and reduced estimated future cash flows as a result of macroeconomic conditions in Sky ’ s territories. See “Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates” and Note 8 for further discussion. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding in the current year period. Interest expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding in the current year period and a $78 million charge recorded in the prior year period related to the early redemption of senior notes due 2024. 16 Table of Contents Consolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ (242) $ 602 $ (523) $ 1,696 Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net (2) 106 (207) 532 Other income (loss), net (21) 59 (245) 146 Total investment and other income (loss), net $ (266) $ 766 $ (975) $ 2,374 The chang e in investment and other income (loss), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was due to equity in net income (losses) of investees, net primarily related to our investment in Atairos Group, Inc., realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net and other income (loss), net. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $(97) million and $(473) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, and $555 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. The changes in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily resulted from fair value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities. The change in other income (loss), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the s ame periods in 2021 primarily resulted from net losses on foreign exchange remeasurement in the current year period, losses on insurance contracts and an impairment of an equity method investment. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. In addition, income tax expense was affected by changes in our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of tax law changes, including $286 million of benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 related to state taxes and $498 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 in the United Kingdom (see Note 10). Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was also impacted by the goodwill impairment, which was primarily not deductible for tax purposes (see Note 10). Consolidated Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests The change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to decreased losses at Universal Beijing Resort due to operations in the current year period, partially offset by operations of the streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications in the current year period. The change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to increased losses at Universal Beijing Resort due to operations in the current year period compared to pre-opening costs in the prior year period in advance of the park ’ s opening in September 2021 and operations of the streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications in the current year period. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes. 17 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 % 2022 2021 % Revenue Residential: Broadband $ 6,135 $ 5,801 5.7 % $ 18,292 $ 17,118 6.9 % Video 5,255 5,499 (4.4) 16,214 16,676 (2.8) Voice 745 851 (12.5) 2,293 2,592 (11.5) Wireless 789 603 30.8 2,188 1,672 30.9 Business services 2,436 2,227 9.4 7,256 6,597 10.0 Advertising 756 705 7.2 2,174 2,002 8.6 Other 423 427 (0.9) 1,263 1,265 (0.2) Total revenue 16,539 16,115 2.6 49,680 47,922 3.7 Operating costs and expenses Programming 3,446 3,546 (2.8) 10,611 10,809 (1.8) Technical and product support 2,284 2,169 5.3 6,749 6,265 7.7 Customer service 574 581 (1.1) 1,727 1,765 (2.2) Advertising, marketing and promotion 943 1,012 (6.8) 2,926 2,887 1.3 Franchise and other regulatory fees 408 432 (5.7) 1,237 1,382 (10.5) Other 1,430 1,305 9.6 4,258 3,841 10.9 Total operating costs and expenses 9,086 9,045 0.5 27,508 26,949 2.1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 7,452 $ 7,069 5.4 % $ 22,172 $ 20,972 5.7 % 18 Table of Contents Customer Metrics Our customer relationships net additions were lower in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to prior periods primarily due to decreased growth in our broadband net additions and also reflected accelerated net losses in our video and voice customers. In a reversal from pandemic trends, our broadband net addition growth has slowed primarily reflecting continued low household move levels and an increasingly competitive environment, which is continuing in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. Business customers are gener ally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system, with certain offerings such as Ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships. Wireless lines represent the number of activated, eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics in 2021 did not include customers in certain pandemic-related programs through which portions of our customers temporarily received our services for free. These programs ended in December 2021, resulting in a one-time benefit to net additions in the three months ended March 31, 2022.

While revenue from our residential broadband, video, voice and wireless services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses. Cable Communications Segment – Revenue Broadband Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due to increases in average rates and increases in the number of residential broadband customers. Video Revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due to declines in the number of residential video customers, partially offset by increases in average rates.

Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our operating margin is Adjusted EB ITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 was 45.1% and 44.6%, respectively. Our operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was 43.9% and 43.8%, respectively.

The timing of this event will also result in lower sports programming expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as an increase in the first half of 2023. This increase was partially offset by lower entertainment programming costs in the current year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily reflecting lower costs associated with Serie A in Italy as a result of the reduced broadcast rights and lower costs associated with other sports contracts in Germany in the current year period, partially offset by the timing of recognition of costs related to sporting events.

Refer to Note 2 for a description of transactions between our segments. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 27 Table of Contents We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods. 28 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Sky Constant Currency Growth Rates Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Actual Constant Currency Constant Currency Change Actual Constant Currency Constant Currency Change (in millions, except per customer data) 2022 2021 % 2022 2021 % Revenue Direct-to-consumer $ 3,510 $ 3,525 (0.4) % $ 11,073 $ 11,197 (1.1) % Content 273 256 6.4 833 919 (9.3) Advertising 471 479 (1.6) 1,623 1,605 1.1 Total revenue 4,253 4,260 (0.2) 13,529 13,720 (1.4) Operating costs and expenses Programming and production 1,570 1,520 3.3 5,080 6,062 (16.2) Direct network costs 635 553 14.8 1,944 1,726 12.7 Other 1,348 1,359 (0.8) 4,320 4,234 2.0 Total operating costs and expenses 3,553 3,431 3.5 11,344 12,022 (5.6) Adjusted EBITDA $ 701 $ 829 (15.5) % $ 2,185 $ 1,698 28.7 % Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship $ 51.25 $ 50.91 0.7 % $ 53.48 $ 53.87 (0.7) % Other Adjustments From time to time, we present adjusted information, such as revenue, to exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 Cash provided by operating activities $ 20,530 $ 21,457 Cash used in investing activities $ (10,158) $ (8,406) Cash used in financing activities $ (13,299) $ (12,946) (in millions) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,695 $ 8,711 Short-term and long-term debt $ 92,452 $ 94,850 Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cas h equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. As of September 30, 2022, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. 29 Table of Contents Operating Activit ies Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 Operating income $ 9,511 $ 15,996 Depreciation and amortization 10,349 10,222 Goodwill and long-lived asset impairments 8,583 — Noncash share-based compensation 989 1,019 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (2,736) (1,057) Payments of interest (2,341) (2,943) Payments of income taxes (4,022) (2,201) Proceeds from investments and other 197 420 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 20,530 $ 21,457 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including the return to normal production levels and the timing of sporting events, and decreases in accounts receivable, which included the impact of our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in the prior year period. The decrease in payments of interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to the timing of interest payments following the debt exchange in August 2021, a decrease in average debt outstanding in the current year period and cash proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps related to the collateralized obligation. The increase in payments of income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a tax benefit from our senior notes exchange in 2021, which reduced payments by $0.7 billion in the prior year, higher taxable income in the current year period and payments made in 2022 related to the preceding tax year. The decrease in proceeds from investments and other for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to decreased cash distributions received from equity method investments. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflecting purchases of short-term investments in the current year period (see Note 7) and increased capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets related to software development. The se increases were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments and the sale of a business in the current year period, decreased cash paid related to the construction of Universal Beijing Resort in the current year period and cash paid for the acquisition of a business in the prior year period. Capital expenditures, which are our most significant recurring investing activity, increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflecting increased spending at Them e Parks primarily related to the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando, and at Cable Communications due to increased spending on line extensions, scalable infrastructure, support capital and customer premise equipment. These increases were partially offset by decreased spending at Sky primarily related to customer premise equipment. In 2022, we formed the SkyShowtime joint venture with Paramount Global. The new direct-to-consumer streaming service was made available in select European markets in September 2022, and the partners have committed to a multiyear funding plan that began in 2022. 30 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increases in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans in the current year and higher proceeds fro m borrowings in the prior year period, partially offset by higher repurchases and repayments of debt in the prior year period. Other financing activities included initial contributions related to our streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications received in the current year period under a multiyear funding plan and payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in the prior year period. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstan ding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends In the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. In September 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $20 billion, effective September 13, 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased a total of 225.7 million shares of our Clas s A common stock for $9.5 billion. Under the new authorizati on, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares during the remainder of 2022, which may be in the open market or in private transactions. In addition, we paid $307 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis. On July 27, 2022, we paid dividends of $1.2 billion. In July 2022, our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.27 per share, which was paid in October 2022. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. 31 Table of Contents Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Debt Subject to Cross-Guarantees Comcast $ 84.6 $ 85.9 Comcast Cable (a) 2.0 2.1 NBCUniversal (a) 1.6 1.6 88.2 89.6 Debt Subject to One-Way Guarantees Sky 5.8 6.3 Other (a) 0.1 0.1 5.9 6.5 Debt Not Guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 3.3 3.6 Other 1.2 1.2 4.5 4.7 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (6.2) (6.0) Total debt $ 92.5 $ 94.8 (a) NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 7 for additional information. Cross-Guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $127 billion and $126 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $27 billion and $30 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. 32 Table of Contents One-Way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $98 billion and $96 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $26 billion and $29 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights are critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We performed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights as of July 1, 2022. In connection with our impairment assessment process, in order to support our qualitative assessments, we typically perform quantitative assessments of our reporting units approximately once every four years. Pursuant to this practice, our current year impairment testing for our cable franchise rights and goodwill in our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments was based on quantitative assessments, and no impairment was required. The goodwill in our Sky segment resulted from our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018, and given this was a recent transaction, the fair value of the Sky reporting unit has been in close proximity to its carrying value. We performed a quantitative assessment for goodwill in our Sky reporting unit and determined that the fair value had declined, resulting in an impairment of $8.1 billion (see Note 8). In preparing the quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of the Sky reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis involved significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business, including the estimated impacts of macroeconomic conditions in the Sky territories, as well as the selection of the discount rate, which increased by 125 basis points compared to the analysis in 2021. When analyzing the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model, we also considered multiples of earnings from comparable public companies and recent market transactions. Changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 33 Table of Contents ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have evaluated the information required under this item that was disclosed in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and there have been no material changes to this information.

Exhibits 31 SIGNATURES 32 Explanatory Note This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “NBCUniversal;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “goal,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC. Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • a cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in five reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Cable Communications is a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and other services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand. We also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Media consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s television and streaming platforms, including national, regional and international cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; and Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service. Studios consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s film and television studio production and distribution operations. Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; Osaka, Japan; and Beijing, China. Sky is one of Europe ’ s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Our financial data by reportable segment is presented in the tables below. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 16,601 $ 7,448 $ 1,945 $ 1,776 $ 409 NBCUniversal Media 5,332 1,337 251 22 43 Studios 2,966 1 11 1 4 Theme Parks 1,804 632 266 319 9 Headquarters and Other 8 ( 137 ) 123 121 45 Eliminations (a) ( 664 ) 23 — — — NBCUniversal 9,445 1,856 651 463 100 Sky 4,501 863 809 130 169 Corporate and Other 164 ( 304 ) 62 45 64 Eliminations (a) ( 696 ) ( 36 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 30,016 $ 9,827 $ 3,469 $ 2,414 $ 743 Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 16,002 $ 7,073 $ 1,950 $ 1,695 $ 337 NBCUniversal Media 5,148 1,378 254 19 42 Studios 2,224 156 12 1 5 Theme Parks 1,095 221 195 100 8 Headquarters and Other 22 ( 186 ) 125 62 30 Eliminations (a) ( 534 ) ( 15 ) — — — NBCUniversal 7,955 1,553 586 182 86 Sky 5,220 560 826 184 211 Corporate and Other 92 ( 261 ) 21 83 37 Eliminations (a) ( 723 ) 2 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 28,546 $ 8,927 $ 3,383 $ 2,144 $ 671 Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 33,142 $ 14,720 $ 3,905 $ 3,143 $ 744 NBCUniversal Media 12,196 2,496 500 34 88 Studios 5,722 246 23 2 7 Theme Parks 3,364 1,082 548 540 14 Headquarters and Other 24 ( 329 ) 242 194 75 Eliminations (a) ( 1,566 ) ( 39 ) — — — NBCUniversal 19,741 3,457 1,313 769 185 Sky 9,276 1,485 1,680 277 323 Corporate and Other 402 ( 566 ) 118 82 131 Eliminations (a) ( 1,535 ) ( 119 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 61,026 $ 18,977 $ 7,016 $ 4,270 $ 1,383 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 31,807 $ 13,903 $ 3,880 $ 3,065 $ 652 NBCUniversal Media 10,184 2,851 501 29 75 Studios 4,620 653 25 2 7 Theme Parks 1,714 159 402 226 15 Headquarters and Other 38 ( 395 ) 241 98 57 Eliminations (a) ( 1,576 ) ( 225 ) — — — NBCUniversal 14,980 3,043 1,168 354 153 Sky 10,217 924 1,640 455 412 Corporate and Other 181 ( 541 ) 57 128 65 Eliminations (a) ( 1,434 ) 11 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 55,751 $ 17,339 $ 6,745 $ 4,003 $ 1,283 (a) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. A summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.

As of December 31, 2021, our debt had a carrying value of $ 94.8 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 109.3 billion. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Note 6: Significant Transactions Acquisitions In October 2021, we acquired Masergy, a provider of software-defined networking and cloud platforms for global enterprises, for total cash consideration of $ 1.2 billion. The acquisition accelerates our growth in serving large and mid-sized companies, particularly U.S.-based organizations with multi-site global enterprises. Masergy’s results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date and are reported in our Cable Communications segment. We have recorded a preliminary estimate of Masergy’s assets and liabilities with approximately $ 850 million recorded to goodwill and the remainder primarily attributed to software and customer relationship intangible assets. These estimates are not yet final and are subject to change. The acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations. 10 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 7: Investments and Variable Interest Entities Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ ( 413 ) $ 959 $ ( 280 ) $ 1,095 Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net ( 321 ) 189 ( 205 ) 426 Other income (loss), net ( 162 ) 69 ( 224 ) 87 Investment and other income (loss), net $ ( 897 ) $ 1,216 $ ( 709 ) $ 1,607 The amount of unrealized gains (losses), net recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period was $( 333 ) million and $ 153 million, respectively.

Atairos Atairos is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) that follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $ 26 million and $ 24 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our investment in Atairos, inclusive of certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf and classified as advances within other investments, was $ 4.4 billion and $ 4.7 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, our remaining unfunded capital commitment was $ 1.5 billion. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our collateralized obligation were $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. Other Investments Other investments also includes investments in certain short-term instruments with maturities over three months when purchased, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit and U.S. government obligations, which are generally accounted for at amortized cost. These short-term instruments totaled $ 1.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 and there were no such investments 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation as of December 31, 2021. The carrying amounts of these investments approximate their fair values, which are primarily based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. Consolidated Variable Interest Entity Universal Beijing Resort We own a 30 % interest in a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”), which opened in September 2021. Universal Beijing Resort is a consolidated VIE with the remaining interest owned by a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies. The construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the partners in accordance with their equity interests. As of June 30, 2022, Universal Beijing Resort had $ 3.5 billion of debt outstanding, including $ 3.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of June 30, 2022, our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 8.8 billion and $ 7.7 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.

Overview We are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. COVID-19 has impacted our businesses in a number of ways, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. The most significant continuing impacts have resulted from temporary restrictions and closures at our international theme parks. The continuing effects of COVID-19, in addition to worsening U.S. and global economic conditions and consumer sentiment, may adversely impact demand for our products and services and our results of operations over the near to medium term.

Consolidated revenue increased for the six months ended June 30, 2022, driven by Media, Theme Parks, Cable Communications and Studios, partially offset by decreases in revenue in Sky. Revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Costs and Expenses Consolidated operating costs and expenses, which is comprised of total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased for the three months ended June 30, 2022, driven by Media, Studios, Theme Parks and Cable Communications, partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses in Sky. Consolidated operating costs and expenses, which is comprised of total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased for the six months ended June 30, 2022, driven by Media, Studios, Theme Parks and Cable Communications, partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses in Sky. Operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, businesses development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 % 2022 2021 % Cable Communications $ 1,945 $ 1,950 (0.3) % $ 3,905 $ 3,880 0.7 % NBCUniversal 651 586 11.2 1,313 1,168 12.4 Sky 809 826 (2.0) 1,680 1,640 2.4 Corporate and Other 62 21 191.5 118 57 106.0 Comcast Consolidated $ 3,469 $ 3,383 2.5 % $ 7,016 $ 6,745 4.0 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to increased depreciation at NBCUniversal driven by the opening of Universal Beijing Resort and increased amortization of software at Sky, partially offset by the impacts of foreign currency . Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $568 million and $1.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $586 million and $1.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding in the current year periods and a $78 million charge recorded in the prior year periods related to the early redemption of senior notes due 2024. Consolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ (413) $ 959 $ (280) $ 1,095 Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net (321) 189 (205) 426 Other income (loss), net (162) 69 (224) 87 Total investment and other income (loss), net $ (897) $ 1,216 $ (709) $ 1,607 Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM. The change in investment and other income (loss), net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was due to equity in net income (losses) of investees, net related to our investment in Atairos Group, Inc., realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net and other income (loss), net. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income (loss) of $(454) million and $(376) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, and $883 million and $960 million for the three and six months ended 15 Table of Contents June 30, 2021, respectively. The changes in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily resulted from fair value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities. The change in other income (loss), net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily resulted from losses on insurance contracts, an impairment of an equity method investment and net losses on foreign exchange remeasurement in the current year period. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The decrease in income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was primarily driven by $498 million of income tax expense recognized in the second quarter of 2021 related to an increase in our net deferred tax liability as a result of the enactment of tax law changes in the United Kingdom and lower income before income taxes in the current year periods, partially offset by lower tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation plans. Consolidated Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests The changes in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was primarily due to increased losses at Universal Beijing Resort due to operations in the current year period compared to pre-opening costs in the prior year period in advance of the park ’ s opening in September 2021 (see Note 7). Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes.

Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. Business customers are gener ally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system, with certain offerings such as Ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships. Wireless lines represent the number of activated, eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics in 2021 did not include customers in certain pandemic-related programs through which portions of our customers temporarily received our services for free. These programs ended in December 2021, resulting in a one-time benefit to net additions in the three months ended March 31, 2022. Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 % 2022 2021 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 160.88 $ 158.53 1.5 % $ 161.03 $ 158.45 1.6 % Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 72.18 $ 70.07 3.0 % $ 71.52 $ 69.26 3.3 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential broadband, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses. 17 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment – Revenue Broadband Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due to increases in average rates and increases in the number of residential broadband customers. Video Revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due to declines in the number of residential video customers, partially offset by increases in average rates. We expect that the number of residential video customers will continue to decline, negatively impacting video revenue as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. Voice Revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to declines in the number of residential voice customers. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Revenue in creased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to increases in the number of customer lines. Business Services Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due to increases in average rates and customer relationships compared to the prior year periods and due to the acquisition of Masergy in October 2021. Advertising Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to increases in political advertising, revenue from our advanced advertising businesses and advertising at our Xumo streaming service. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to declines in the number of video subscribers, partially offset by contractual rate increases. Technical and product support expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to increases in costs associated with our wireless phone service resulting from increases in device sales and the number of customers receiving the service, and the acquisition of Masergy. Customer service expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses were consistent for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and increased for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to increased spending associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings. Franchise and other regulatory fees decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to decreases in regulatory costs. Other operating costs and expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to lower levels of bad d ebt expense in the prior year periods. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our operating margin is Adjusted EB ITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was 44.9% and 44.4%, respectively. Our operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was 44.2% and 43.7%, respectively. 18 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Segments Results of Operations Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 % 2022 2021 % Revenue Media $ 5,332 $ 5,148 3.6 % $ 12,196 $ 10,184 19.8 % Studios 2,966 2,224 33.3 5,722 4,620 23.9 Theme Parks 1,804 1,095 64.8 3,364 1,714 96.3 Headquarters and Other 8 22 (63.9) 24 38 (35.9) Eliminations (664) (534) (24.5) (1,566) (1,576) 0.7 Total revenue $ 9,445 $ 7,955 18.7 % $ 19,741 $ 14,980 31.8 % Adjusted EBITDA Media $ 1,337 $ 1,378 (2.9) % $ 2,496 $ 2,851 (12.4) % Studios 1 156 (99.5) 246 653 (62.4) Theme Parks 632 221 186.5 1,082 159 NM Headquarters and Other (137) (186) 26.3 (329) (395) 16.8 Eliminations 23 (15) NM (39) (225) 82.7 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,856 $ 1,553 19.5 % $ 3,457 $ 3,043 13.6 % Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.

Programming and production costs increased primarily due to costs associated with our broadcasts of the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl and higher programming costs at Peacock, partially offset by lower costs for other sports programming. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs and other operating and administrative costs increased primarily due to higher costs related to Peacock. Operating costs and expenses included $912 million and $1.8 billion related to Peacock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, including amounts related to the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl in the first quarter of 2022. Operating costs and expenses included $485 million and $853 million related to Peacock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and ma rketing as we invest in the platform and attract new customers. 20 Table of Contents Studios Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 % 2022 2021 % Revenue Content licensing $ 2,118 $ 1,781 19.0 % $ 4,397 $ 3,855 14.0 % Theatrical 550 198 177.2 718 237 202.6 Home entertainment and other 298 245 21.3 607 527 15.2 Total revenue 2,966 2,224 33.3 5,722 4,620 23.9 Operating costs and expenses Programming and production 2,241 1,603 39.8 4,215 3,217 31.0 Other operating and administrative 193 169 13.8 403 329 22.3 Advertising, marketing and promotion 531 296 79.7 858 420 104.4 Total operating costs and expenses 2,965 2,068 43.4 5,476 3,967 38.1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1 $ 156 (99.5) % $ 246 $ 653 (62.4) % Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM. Studios Seg ment – Revenue Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due to increases in theatrical and content licensing revenue. Theatrical revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the number of theatrical releases in the current year period, including Jurassic World: Dominion . The prior year periods included the release of F9 and were impacted by theater closures and theaters operating at reduced capacity as a result of COVID-19. Content licensing revenue increased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television and film studios under licensing agreements, including additional sales of content as production levels returned to normal. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, this increase was partially offset by the impact of a new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock in the prior year period. Studios Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to increases in programming and production costs and advertising, marketing and promotion costs. Programming and production costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with content licensing sales and theatrical releases in the current year periods. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs increased due to higher spending on current period and upcoming theatrical releases.

Them e Parks Segment – Revenue Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to improved operating conditions compared to the same periods in 2021, when each of our theme parks either operated at limited capacity or was closed as a result of COVID-19, and from the operations of Universal Beijing Resort, which opened in September 2021. In 2022, our theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood operated without capacity restrictions, and the requirement for proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test previously put in place in the fourth quarter of 2021 was lifted for our theme park in Hollywood in the first quarter of 2022. Our theme park in Japan temporarily reinstated capacity restrictions during the first quarter of 2022, which were lifted by the end of that period. Our newest theme park in Beijing continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and related travel restrictions and temporarily closed in May through the end of June of 2022 when it reopened at limited capacity. 21 Table of Contents Theme Parks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 primarily due to increased operating costs at our theme parks, as compared to decreased operating costs during the temporary closures and capacity restrictions in the prior year periods, and due to operating costs associated with Universal Beijing Resort in the current year periods, which were higher than pre-opening costs in the prior year periods.

Prior year amounts include the impact of a new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock during the first quarter of 2021. Results of operations for NBCUniversal may be impacted as we continue to use content on our platforms, including Peacock, rather than licensing it to third parties. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 , approximately 35% and 38%, respectively, of Studios segment content licensing revenue resulted from transactions with other segments, primarily with the Media segment. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 , approximately 33% and 44% respectively, of Studios segment content licensing revenue resulted from transactions with other segments, primarily with the Media segment. Eliminations increase or decrease to the extent that additional content is made available to our other segments. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of transactions between our segments.

Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 25 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of Sky’s constant currency growth rates. Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by Sky’s customers. Each of Sky’s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to-consumer service offerings. Sky Segment – Revenue Direct-to-Consumer Revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared with the prior year periods primarily due to decreases in customer relationships, while average revenue per customer relationship was consistent. The decreases in customer relationships were primarily driven by declines in Italy, partially offset by increases in the United Kingdom compared to the prior year period. Average revenue per customer relationship for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 reflected the impacts of COVID-19 on business customers in the United Kingdom in the prior year periods, partially offset by declines in average rates in Italy and Germany. The decline in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in Italy included the effects of the reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, which we had held through the end of the 2020-21 season. Beginning with the 2021-22 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 2023-24 season, we have nonexclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches, which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue in Italy in 2022. Content Revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to lower sports programming licensing revenue driven by changes in licensing agreements in Italy and Germany. Advertising Revenue decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily as a result of decreased advertising revenue associated with Serie A, partially offset by an increase in advertising revenue in the United Kingdom. Revenue decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily as a result of an overall market improvement in the United Kingdom compared to the prior year periods, partially offset by decreased advertising revenue associated with Serie A. Sky Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily reflecting lower costs associated with Serie A in Italy as a result of the reduced broadcast rights and lower costs associated with other sports contracts in Germany in the current year period, as well as the timing of recognition of costs related to sporting events. 23 Table of Contents Direct network costs increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct network costs increased primarily due to an increase in costs associated with Sky ’ s broadband and wireless phone s ervices as a result of increases in the number of customers receiving these services. Other expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to higher administrative costs.

Other business initiatives primarily include costs associated with Sky Glass smart televisions and the related hardware sales and beginning in the end of the second quarter of 2022, the operations of our streaming platform joint venture with Charter Communications. This consolidated joint venture, which was formed in June 2022, is focused on developing and offering a streaming platform on a variety of devices, including XClass TV smart televisions, and also operates the Xumo streaming service. Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to sales of Sky Glass smart televisions. The increase for the six months ended June 30, 2022 also included increases at Comcast Spectacor as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year periods. Expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to costs related to Sky Glas s. We expect to continue to incur increased costs in 2022 related to the launches of Sky Glass and our streaming platform joint venture.

This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods. 25 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Sky Constant Currency Growth Rates Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Actual Constant Currency Constant Currency Change Actual Constant Currency Constant Currency Change (in millions, except per customer data) 2022 2021 % 2022 2021 % Revenue Direct-to-consumer $ 3,680 $ 3,771 (2.4) % $ 7,564 $ 7,672 (1.4) % Content 265 318 (16.4) 561 662 (15.4) Advertising 556 574 (3.1) 1,152 1,126 2.3 Total revenue 4,501 4,662 (3.5) 9,276 9,460 (1.9) Operating costs and expenses Programming and production 1,562 2,178 (28.3) 3,510 4,543 (22.7) Direct network costs 638 561 13.8 1,310 1,173 11.6 Other 1,439 1,418 1.5 2,972 2,875 3.4 Total operating costs and expenses 3,639 4,157 (12.5) 7,791 8,591 (9.3) Adjusted EBITDA $ 863 $ 505 70.7 % $ 1,485 $ 869 70.9 % Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship $ 53.81 $ 53.89 (0.1) % $ 55.18 $ 55.08 0.2 % Liquidity and Capital Resources Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 Cash provided by operating activities $ 13,584 $ 15,357 Cash used in investing activities $ (6,792) $ (5,631) Cash used in financing activities $ (8,636) $ (9,064) (in millions) June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,822 $ 8,711 Short-term and long-term debt $ 93,542 $ 94,850 Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cas h equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. As of June 30, 2022, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. 26 Table of Contents Operating Activit ies Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 Operating income $ 11,936 $ 10,546 Depreciation and amortization 7,016 6,745 Noncash share-based compensation 675 711 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (1,715) 892 Payments of interest (1,644) (1,909) Payments of income taxes (2,841) (1,832) Proceeds from investments and other 155 204 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,584 $ 15,357 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including the return to normal production levels and the timing of sporting events, decreases in deferred revenue, which included the impacts of our broadcast of the Beijing Olympics, increases in accounts receivable, and the timing of administrative costs. The decrease in payments of interest for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding in the current year period and cash proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps related to the collateralized obligation. The increase in payments of income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was due to higher taxable income and payments related to the preceding tax year. The decrease in proceeds from investments and other for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to decreased cash distributions received from equity method investments. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflecting purchases of short-term investments in the current year period (see Note 7) and increased capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets related to software development. The se increases were partially offset by decreased cash paid related to the construction of Universal Beijing Resort in the current year period and cash paid for the acquisition of a business in the prior year period. Capital expenditures, which is our most significant recurring investing activity, increased for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflecting increased spending at Them e Parks related to the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando, and at Cable Communications due to increased spending on line extensions and scalable infrastructure, partially offset by decreased spendi ng on customer premise equipment and support capital. These increases were partially offset by decreased spending at Sky primarily related to customer premise equipment. In 2022, we formed the SkyShowtime joint venture with Paramount Global. The new direct-to-consumer streaming service is expected to be made available in select European markets starting in 2022, and the partners have committed to a multiyear funding plan that began in 2022. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to repurchases and repayments of debt in the prior year period partially off set by increases in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans in the current year. Other financing activities included initial contributions related to our streaming joint venture with Charter Communications received in the current year period 27 Table of Contents under a multiyear funding plan and payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in the prior year period. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends In the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. In January 2022, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion. During the six months ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased a total of 133.4 million shares of our Class A common stock for $6.0 billion. Under the authorizati on, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares during the remainder of 2022, which may be in the open market or in private transactions. In addition, we paid $288 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2022, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis. On April 27, 2022, we paid dividends of $1.2 billion. In May 2022, our Board of Directors approved our second quarter dividend of $0.27 per share, which was paid in July 2022. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.

Cross-Guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving 28 Table of Contents credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $126 billion for both periods and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $28 billion and $30 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. One-Way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $97 billion and $96 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $27 billion and $29 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have evaluated the information required under this item that was disclosed in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and there have been no material changes to this information.

Exhibits 30 SIGNATURES 31 Explanatory Note This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three months ended March 31, 2022. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “NBCUniversal;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “goal,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC. Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • a cyber attack, information or security breach, or technology disruption or failure may negatively impact our ability to conduct our business or result in the misuse of confidential information, all of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • natural disasters, severe weather and other uncontrollable events could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in five reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Cable Communications is a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and other services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand. We also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Media consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s television and streaming platforms, including national, regional and international cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; and Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service. Studios consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s film and television studio production and distribution operations. Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; Osaka, Japan; and Beijing, China. Sky is one of Europe ’ s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV smart televisions. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Our financial data by reportable segment is presented in the tables below. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 16,540 $ 7,272 $ 1,960 $ 1,367 $ 334 NBCUniversal Media 6,865 1,159 250 12 46 Studios 2,757 245 11 1 3 Theme Parks 1,560 451 282 220 5 Headquarters and Other 16 ( 191 ) 118 72 31 Eliminations (a) ( 901 ) ( 62 ) — — — NBCUniversal 10,296 1,601 662 306 85 Sky 4,775 622 870 147 154 Corporate and Other 238 ( 262 ) 56 37 67 Eliminations (a) ( 840 ) ( 82 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 31,010 $ 9,150 $ 3,548 $ 1,856 $ 641 Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 15,805 $ 6,830 $ 1,929 $ 1,370 $ 315 NBCUniversal Media 5,036 1,473 247 10 32 Studios 2,396 497 12 1 2 Theme Parks 619 ( 61 ) 207 126 6 Headquarters and Other 16 ( 209 ) 117 35 28 Eliminations (a) ( 1,043 ) ( 210 ) — — — NBCUniversal 7,024 1,490 583 172 68 Sky 4,997 364 814 271 201 Corporate and Other 89 ( 281 ) 36 46 28 Eliminations (a) ( 710 ) 10 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 27,205 $ 8,413 $ 3,362 $ 1,859 $ 612 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation (a) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. A summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.

As of December 31, 2021, our debt had a carrying value of $ 94.8 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 109.3 billion. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Note 6: Significant Transactions Acquisitions In October 2021, we acquired Masergy, a provider of software-defined networking and cloud platforms for global enterprises, for total cash consideration of $ 1.2 billion. The acquisition accelerates our growth in serving large and mid-sized companies, particularly U.S.-based organizations with multi-site global enterprises. Masergy’s results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date and are reported in our Cable Communications segment. We have recorded a preliminary estimate of Masergy’s assets and liabilities with approximately $ 850 million recorded to goodwill and the remainder primarily attributed to software and customer relationship intangible assets. These estimates are not yet final and are subject to change. The acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations. 10 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 7: Investments and Variable Interest Entities Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 133 $ 136 Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 117 237 Other income (loss), net ( 62 ) 17 Investment and other income (loss), net $ 188 $ 390 The amount of unrealized gains (losses), net recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period was $ 90 million and $ 98 million, respectively.

Atairos Atairos is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) that follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $ 13 million and $ 12 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our investment in Atairos, inclusive of certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf and classified as advances within other investments, was $ 4.8 billion and $ 4.7 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, our remaining unfunded capital commitment was $ 1.5 billion. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our collateralized obligation were $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. Consolidated Variable Interest Entity Universal Beijing Resort We own a 30 % interest in a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”), which opened in September 2021. Universal Beijing Resort is a consolidated VIE with the remaining interest owned by a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies. The construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation the partners in accordance with their equity interests.

Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. In March 2022, we granted 16 million RSUs and 51 million stock options related to our annual management awards.

The redeemable subsidiary preferred stock was presented in redeemable noncontrolling interests. Contingencies We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Impacts of COVID-19 COVID-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. The most significant continuing impacts to our businesses from COVID-19 have resulted from temporary restrictions at our international theme parks. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such impact will depend on restrictive governmental measures, U.S. and global economic conditions, and consumer behavior.

Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 24 for additional information, including our definition and our use of Adjusted EBITDA, and for a reconciliation from net income attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Revenue Consolidated revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022, driven by Media, Theme Parks, Cable Communications and Studios, partially offset by decreases in revenue in Sky. Revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” 14 Table of Contents Consolidated Costs and Expenses Consolidated operating costs and expenses, which is comprised of total costs and expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022, driven by Media, Studios, Theme Parks and Cable Communications, partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses in Sky. Operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, businesses development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 % Cable Communications $ 1,960 $ 1,929 1.6 % NBCUniversal 662 583 13.6 Sky 870 814 7.0 Corporate and Other 56 36 55.2 Comcast Consolidated $ 3,548 $ 3,362 5.5 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased depreciation at NBCUniversal driven by the opening of Universal Beijing Resort and increased amortization at Sky driven by increased amortization of software . Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $592 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding in the current year period. Consolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 % Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 133 $ 136 (2.2) % Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 117 237 (50.7) Other income (loss), net (62) 17 NM Total investment and other income (loss), net $ 188 $ 390 (52.0) % Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM. The change in investment and other income (loss), net for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net and other income (loss), net. The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily resulted from losses on marketable securities in the current year period compared to gains in the prior year period, partially offset by increased gains from fair value adjustments for nonmarketable equity securities in the current year period. The change in other income (loss), net for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily resulted from losses on insurance contracts and net losses on foreign exchange remeasurement in the current year period. Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net was consistent with the prior year period and included income for our investment in Atairos of $78 million and $77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily driven by tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation plans and higher income before income taxes. 15 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests The changes in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to decreased losses at Universal Beijing Resort due to operations in the current year period compared to pre-opening costs in the prior year period in advance of the park ’ s opening in September 2021 (see Note 7). Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes.

Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. Business customers are gener ally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system, with certain offerings such as Ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships. Wireless lines represent the number of activated, eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics in 2021 did not include customers in certain pandemic-related programs through which portions of our customers temporarily received our services for free. These programs ended in December 2021, resulting in a one-time benefit to net additions in the three months ended March 31, 2022. Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 160.67 $ 158.17 1.6 % Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 70.64 $ 68.35 3.3 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential broadband, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe both metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business, and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses. Cable Communications Segment – Revenue Broadband Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due to an increase in the number of residential broadband customers and an increase in average rates. 17 Table of Contents Video Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential video customers, partially offset by an increase in average rates. We expect that the number of residential video customers will continue to decline, negatively impacting video revenue as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. Voice Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential voice customers. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Revenue in creased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines. Business Services Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increases in average rates and customer relationships compared to the prior year period and due to the acquisition of Masergy in October 2021. Advertising Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increases in political advertising, advertising at our Xumo streaming service and revenue from our advanced advertising businesses. Other Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due to increases in revenue from licensing of our technology platforms and from our security and automation services. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decline in the number of video subscribers, partially offset by contractual rate increases. Technical and product support expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in costs associated with our wireless phone service resulting from increases in the number of customers receiving the service and device sales, and the acquisition of Masergy. Customer service expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased spending associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings, including advertising expenses associated with the Beijing Olympics. Franchise and other regulatory fees decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in regulatory costs. Other operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to lower levels of bad d ebt expense in the prior year period, and higher personnel and other overhead costs. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our operating margin is Adjusted EB ITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 was 44.0% and 43.2%, respectively. 18 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Segments Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 % Revenue Media $ 6,865 $ 5,036 36.3 % Studios 2,757 2,396 15.1 Theme Parks 1,560 619 151.9 Headquarters and Other 16 16 1.9 Eliminations (901) (1,043) 13.5 Total revenue $ 10,296 $ 7,024 46.6 % Adjusted EBITDA Media $ 1,159 $ 1,473 (21.3) % Studios 245 497 (50.7) Theme Parks 451 (61) NM Headquarters and Other (191) (209) 8.3 Eliminations (62) (210) 70.4 Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,601 $ 1,490 7.4 % Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.

Excluding $1.0 billion and $0.5 billion of incremental revenue associated with our broadcasts of the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl, respectively, Media revenue increased 6.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.

Excluding $1.2 billion of incremental revenue associated with our broadcasts of the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, advertising revenue increased due to higher pricing at our networks in the current year period and increased advertising revenue at Peacock. These increases were partially offset by continued audience ratings declines at our networks and increased revenue related to other sporting events in the prior year period due to COVID-19 timing impacts. 19 Table of Contents Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2022 2021 % Distribution $ 3,033 $ 2,495 21.6 % Distribution, excluding Beijing Olympics 2,706 2,495 8.5 Distribution revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to our broadcast of the Beijing Olympics. Excluding $327 million of incremental revenue associated with our broadcast of the Beijing Olympics, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, distribution revenue increased due to an increase in distribution revenue at Peacock, as well as an increase at our networks due to contractual rate increases, partially offset by a decline in the number of subscribers. We expect the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. Revenue included $472 million and $91 million related to Peacock for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including amounts related to the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl. Media Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 due to increases in programming and production costs; advertising, marketing and promotion costs; and other operating and administrative costs. Programming and production costs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to costs associated with our broadcasts of the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl and higher programming costs at Peacock. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs increased primarily due to higher marketing costs related to Peacock and higher spending related to our networks. Other operating and administrative costs increased primarily due to increased costs related to Peacock. Operating costs and expenses included $928 million and $368 million related to Peacock for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including amounts related to the Beijing Olympics and Super Bowl. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and ma rketing as we invest in the platform and attract new customers.

Content licensing revenue increased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our film and television studios under licensing agreements, including additional sales of content as production levels returned to normal, partially offset by the impact of a new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock in the prior year period. Theatrical revenue increased primarily due to recent releases, including Sing 2 , and the impact of theater closures and theaters operating at reduced capacity as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period . Studios Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increases in programming and production costs and advertising, marketing and promotion costs. Programming and production costs increased primarily due to higher costs associated with content licensing sales and theatrical releases in the current year period. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs increased due to higher spending on theatrical releases in the current year period.

Them e Parks Segment – Revenue Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to improved operating conditions compared to the same period in 2021, when each of our theme parks was either operating at a limited capacity or closed as a result of COVID-19, and from the operations of Universal Beijing Resort, which opened in September 2021. In 2022, our theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood operated without capacity restrictions and the requirement for proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test previously put in place in the fourth quarter of 2021 was lifted for our theme park in Hollywood. Our theme park in Japan temporarily reinstated capacity restrictions during the first quarter of 2022, which were lifted by the end of the period. Our newest theme park in Beijing continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and related travel restrictions. Theme Parks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased operating costs at our theme parks, as compared to decreased operating costs during the temporary closures and capacity restrictions in the prior year period, and due to operating costs associated with Universal Beijing Resort in the current year period, which were higher than pre-opening costs in the prior year period.

Prior year amounts include the impact of a new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock during the first quarter of 2021. Results of operations for NBCUniversal may be impacted as we continue to use content on our platforms, including Peacock, rather than licensing it to third parties. For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 20 21, approximately 41% and 52%, respectively, of Studios segment content licensing revenue resulted from transactions with other segments, primarily with the Media segment. Eliminations increase or decrease to the extent that additional content is made available to our other segments. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of transactions between our segments.

Each of Sky’s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to-consumer service offerings. Sky Segment – Revenue Direct-to-Consumer Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue remained consistent with the prior year period primarily due to a decrease in customer relationships offset by an increase in average revenue per customer relationship. The decrease in customer relationships was driven by a decrease in Italy, partially offset by an increase in the United Kingdom. The increase in average revenue per customer relationship reflects the impacts of COVID-19 on business customers in the prior year period and the impact of rate increases in the United Kingdom, partially offset by declines in average rates in Italy. The decline in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in Italy included the effects of the reduced broadcast rights for Serie A, which we had held through the end of the 2020-21 season. Beginning with the 2021-22 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 2023-24 season, we have nonexclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches, which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue in Italy in 2022. Content Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to lower sports programming licensing revenue driven by changes in licensing agreements in Italy and Germany. Advertising Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily as a result of an overall market improvement in the United Kingdom compared to the prior year period, partially offset by decreased advertising revenue associated with Serie A. Sky Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily reflecting lower costs associated with Serie A in Italy as a result of the reduced broadcast rights and lower costs associated with other sports contracts in Germany in the current year period, as well as the timing of recognition of costs related to sporting events. Direct network costs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct network costs increased primarily due to an increase in costs associated with Sky ’ s broadband and wireless phone s ervices as a result of increases in the number of customers receiving these services and wireless device sales. Other expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses increased primarily due to higher administrative costs and higher fees paid to third-party channels related to advertising sales.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP. 24 Table of Contents Reconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 3,549 $ 3,329 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (73) (37) Income tax expense 1,288 1,119 Investment and other (income) loss, net (188) (390) Interest expense 993 1,018 Depreciation 2,213 2,117 Amortization 1,335 1,245 Adjustments (a) 33 12 Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,150 $ 8,413 (a) Amounts represent the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, including costs related to our investment portfolio, and Sky transaction-related costs in 2021. Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cas h equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets, investing in business opportunities, and returning capital to shareholders. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. Our commercial paper program provides a lower-cost source of borrowing to fund our short-term working capital requirements. As of March 31, 2022, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion.

The decrease in payments of interest for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to the timing of interest payments following the debt exchange in August 2021 and a decrease in average debt outstanding in the current year period. The decrease in proceeds from investments and other for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to decreased cash distributions received from equity method investments. 26 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities remained consistent for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflecting decreased cash paid related to the construction of Universal Beijing Resort in the current year period and cash paid for the acquisition of a business in the prior year period, offset by decreased proceeds from sales of business and investments in the current year period. Capital expenditures, which is our most significant recurring investing activity, remained consistent for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflecting increased spending at Them e Parks related to the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando, offset by decreased spendi ng at Sky primarily related to customer premise equipment. Capital expenditures at Cable Communications were consistent with the prior period. In 2022, we formed the SkyShowtime joint venture with Paramount Global. The new direct-to-consumer streaming service is expected to be made available in select European markets starting in 2022, and the partners have committed to a multiyear funding plan that is expected to begin in 2022. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased for the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans. Net cash used in financing activities in both periods included dividend payments and repayments of debt, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings, and net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 included payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. See Notes 5 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends In the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program, which had been paused since the beginning of 2019. In January 2022, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased a total of 62.5 million shares of our Class A common stock for $3.0 billion. Under the authorizati on, which does not have an expiration date, we expect to repurchase additional shares during the remainder of 2022, which may be in the open market or in private transactions. In addition, we paid $223 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2022, we paid dividends of $1.2 billion, and our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in our dividend to $1.08 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.27 per share, which was paid in April 2022. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. 27 Table of Contents Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Debt Subject to Cross-Guarantees Comcast $ 85.6 $ 85.9 Comcast Cable (a) 2.1 2.1 NBCUniversal (a) 1.6 1.6 89.4 89.6 Debt Subject to One-Way Guarantees Sky 6.2 6.3 Other (a) 0.1 0.1 6.4 6.5 Debt Not Guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 3.7 3.6 Other 1.2 1.2 4.9 4.7 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (6.1) (6.0) Total debt $ 94.6 $ 94.8 (a) NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 7 for additional information. Cross-Guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $126 billion and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $30 billion. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. One-Way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. 28 Table of Contents Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis, and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $97 billion and $96 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $29 billion. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt, and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Exhibits 37 SIGNATURES 38 Explanatory Note This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “NBCUniversal;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC. Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • we rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comcast Corporation Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Unaudited) Three Months Ended September 30, Nine

Statements Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior year period to conform to classifications used in 2021. See Note 2 for a discussion of the changes in our presentation of segment operating results. Note 2: Segment Information In the first quarter of 2021, we changed our presentation of segment operating results. We now present our operations in five reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. The changes reflect a reorganized operating structure in NBCUniversal’s television and streaming businesses and primarily include: (i) the combination of NBCUniversal’s television networks (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the operations of Peacock (previously reported in Corporate and Other) in the Media segment, and (ii) the presentation of NBCUniversal’s television studio production operations (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the studio operations of Filmed Entertainment in the Studios segment. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. Cable Communications is a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services, which are marketed individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. Media consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s television and streaming platforms, including national, regional and international cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service; and various digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and digital properties; and the fees received from the distribution of our television network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers and from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. Media also generates other revenue from content licensing and various digital properties. Studios consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s film and television studio production and distribution operations. Revenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our owned film and television content to broadcast, cable and premium networks, and to direct-to-consumer streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-per-view services provided by multichannel video providers and over-the-top service providers; from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters; and from the sale of owned content on DVDs, Blu-ray discs and through digital distribution services. Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; Osaka, Japan; and Beijing, China. We are developing an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Revenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our Universal theme parks. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services; from the distribution of Sky’s owned television networks on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and acquired programming to third-party video providers; and from the sale of advertising. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives.

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue at Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue at Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue at Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses at Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period. A summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.

As of December 31, 2020, our debt had a carrying value of $ 103.8 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 125.6 billion. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation In March 2021, we entered into a new $ 11 billion revolving credit facility due March 30, 2026 with a syndicate of banks that may be used for general corporate purposes. We may increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility up to a total of $ 14 billion, as well as extend the expiration date to no later than March 30, 2028, subject to approval of the lenders. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility consists of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcast’s credit rating. As of September 30, 2021, the borrowing margin for borrowings based on the London Interbank Offered Rate was 1.00 %. Our revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios based on debt and EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with all financial covenants for all periods presented. The new revolving credit facility replaced an aggregate $ 9.2 billion of existing revolving credit facilities due May 26, 2022, which were terminated. Our revolving credit facilities were undrawn as of both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Note 6: Significant Transactions Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”), which opened in September 2021. We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction was funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. In the third quarter of 2021, the maximum borrowing limit under the debt financing agreement was increased to ¥ 29.7 billion RMB (approximately $ 4.6 billion) from ¥ 26.6 billion RMB (approximately $ 4.1 billion). As of September 30, 2021, Universal Beijing Resort had $ 3.4 billion of debt outstanding, including $ 3.0 billion principal amount of a term loan under the debt financing agreement. As of September 30, 2021, our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 9.1 billion and $ 7.5 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt. Acquisitions In October 2021, we acquired Masergy, a provider of software-defined networking and cloud platforms for global enterprises, for total cash consideration of $ 1.2 billion. The acquisition accelerates our growth in serving large and mid-sized companies, particularly U.S.-based organizations with multi-site global enterprises. We will apply acquisition accounting to Masergy and its results of operations will be included in our consolidated results of operations following the date of acquisition and be reported in our Cable Communications segment. The assets and liabilities acquired as a result of the transaction will be recorded at their estimated fair values, however, due to the limited time since the acquisition date, the initial acquisition accounting is incomplete. Note 7: Investments Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 602 $ ( 266 ) $ 1,696 $ ( 634 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 106 118 532 65 Other income (loss), net 59 62 146 187 Investment and other income (loss), net $ 766 $ ( 86 ) $ 2,374 $ ( 382 ) The amount of unrealized gains (losses) recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period were losses of $ 165 million and gains of $ 79 million, respectively. The amount of unrealized gains (losses) recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period were gains of $ 91 million and losses of $ 2 million, respectively. 12 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Investments (in millions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Equity method $ 7,044 $ 6,006 Marketable equity securities 368 460 Nonmarketable equity securities 2,092 1,950 Other investments 345 143 Total investments 9,849 8,559 Less: Current investments 123 292 Less: Investment securing collateralized obligation 563 447 Noncurrent investments $ 9,163 $ 7,820 Equity Method Atairos Atairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $ 36 million and $ 184 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our investment in Atairos, inclusive of certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf and classified as advances within other investments, was $ 5.2 billion and $ 3.9 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, our remaining unfunded capital commitment was $ 1.5 billion. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying value and fair value of our collateralized obligation were $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. Other Investments AirTouch In April 2020, Verizon Americas, Inc., formerly known as AirTouch Communications, Inc. (“AirTouch”), redeemed the two series of preferred stock and we received cash payments totaling $ 1.7 billion. Subsequently, we redeemed and repurchased the three series of preferred shares issued by one of our consolidated subsidiaries and made cash payments totaling $ 1.8 billion. Note 8: Equity and Share-Based Compensation Weighted-Average Common Shares Outstanding Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding – basic 4,588 4,577 4,593 4,571 Effect of dilutive securities 77 51 75 45 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding – diluted 4,665 4,628 4,668 4,616 Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders (“diluted EPS”) considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method.

Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. In March 2021, we granted 12.8 million RSUs and 42.3 million stock options related to our annual management awards. The weighted-average fair values associated with these grants were $ 54.62 per RSU and $ 9.64 per stock option.

Note 9: Supplemental Financial Information Income Taxes In the second quarter of 2021, tax law changes were enacted in the United Kingdom that, among other provisions, will increase the corporate tax rate to 25% from 19% effective April 1, 2023. The rate change resulted in an increase to our net deferred tax liabilities of $ 498 million and a corresponding increase to income tax expense in the second quarter of 2021. Our income tax expense in the United Kingdom will be based on the new rate beginning in 2023. Cash Payments for Interest and Income Taxes Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Interest $ 2,943 $ 2,845 Income taxes $ 2,201 $ 2,298 Noncash Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2021: • we recognized operating lease assets and liabilities of $ 2.8 billion related to Universal Beijing Resort with lease terms of 33 years and using a weighted average discount rate of 4.4 % • we acquired $ 1.6 billion of property and equipment and intangible assets that were accrued but unpaid • we recorded a liability of $ 1.2 billion for a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.25 per common share paid in October 2021 14 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation During the nine months ended September 30, 2020: • we acquired $ 1.9 billion of property and equipment and intangible assets that were accrued but unpaid • we recorded a liability of $ 1.1 billion for a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.23 per common share paid in October 2020 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet to the total of the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

As of December 31, 2020, the preferred stock had a carrying value equal to its liquidation preference and was presented in redeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock. Contingencies We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation. 15 Table of Contents ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Refer to Note 2 for information on our reportable segments, including a description of the segment change implemented in the first quarter of 2021. All amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Impacts of COVID-19 The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operatio ns primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts on professional sports, respectively. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such impact will depend on restrictive governmental measures, U.S. and global economic conditions, expanded availability and acceptance of vaccines and consumer behavior in response to COVID-19. The most significant effects of COVID-19 began in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, affecting the comparability of per iods included in this report. The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses. Cable Communications • Beginning in March 2020, new qualifying customers for Internet Essentials, our low-income internet adoption program, receive 60 days of free broadband services. Our customer metrics do not include customers in the free Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment as a result of COVID-19 programs. The number of customers excluded from our customer metrics has continued to decrease as some of these customers either began paying for service, resulting in customer net additions, or disconnected and no longer receive service, and we expect this to continue in future periods. We have experienced improvement in customer collections; however, we believe there continues to be a risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables as a result of COVID-19. NBCUniversal • Our theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood operated without capacity restrictions in the third quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place that ended in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan has been operating with capacity restrictions and our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks at various times in 2020 and 2021 have had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted and we cannot predict if some or all of our parks will remain open or continue to be subject to capacity restrictions, or the level of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in the first quarter of 2021. • Delays to the start of seasons for certain professional sports leagues, including the 2020-2021 NHL and NBA seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 and took place in the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs. 16 Table of Contents • Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. With the temporary closure or limited capacity operation of many movie theaters worldwide, we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally. Delays in theatrical releases affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows. Results of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19. Sky • Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers ’ locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-2021 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In 2020, our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives, with the most significant relating to severance at NBCUniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base. The costs of these initiatives were presented in Corporate and Other. Payments related to NBCUniversal employee severance are expected to be substantially complete in 2021 and the related costs savings will be realized in operating costs and expenses primarily beginning in 2021. A portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives. 17 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 % 2021 2020 % Revenue $ 30,298 $ 25,532 18.7% $ 86,049 $ 75,856 13.4 % Costs and Expenses: Programming and production 10,395 8,565 21.4 28,570 23,683 20.6 Other operating and administrative 8,981 8,059 11.4 25,799 23,959 7.7 Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,995 1,512 32.0 5,462 4,791 14.0 Depreciation 2,177 2,122 2.6 6,407 6,328 1.3 Amortization 1,301 1,198 8.6 3,815 3,520 8.4 Operating income 5,450 4,076 33.7 15,996 13,575 17.8 Interest expense (1,050) (1,220) (14.0) (3,161) (3,544) (10.8) Investment and other income (loss), net 766 (86) NM 2,374 (382) NM Income before income taxes 5,166 2,770 86.5 15,208 9,649 57.6 Income tax expense (1,235) (739) 67.1 (4,354) (2,385) 82.5 Net income 3,931 2,031 93.5 10,854 7,264 49.4 Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock (104) 12 NM (249) 110 NM Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 4,035 $ 2,019 99.8% $ 11,102 $ 7,154 55.2 % Basic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.88 $ 0.44 100.0 % $ 2.42 $ 1.57 54.1 % Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.86 $ 0.44 95.5 % $ 2.38 $ 1.55 53.5 % Adjusted EBITDA (a) $ 8,957 $ 7,583 18.1 % $ 26,297 $ 23,640 11.2 % Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.

Revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Costs and Expenses Media, Studios, Cable Communications and Theme Parks drove increases in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2021, which were partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses in Sky. Media, Sky, Cable Communications, Studios and Theme Parks drove increases in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, businesses development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated costs and expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 also include $177 million related to a legal settlement that was excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and our segment operating results. 18 Table of Contents Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2021 2020 % 2021 2020 % Cable Communications $ 1,965 $ 1,952 0.6 % $ 5,845 $ 5,835 0.2 % NBCUniversal 591 583 1.3 1,759 1,728 1.8 Sky 884 750 17.9 2,524 2,188 15.3 Corporate and Other 38 35 11.6 95 97 (0.4) Comcast Consolidated $ 3,477 $ 3,320 4.8 % $ 10,222 $ 9,848 3.8 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increases at Sky, which include the impacts of foreign currency . Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $603 million and $1.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $574 million and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a $220 million charge recorded in the prior year period related to the early redemption of senior notes, as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding. Interest expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a $360 million charge recorded in the prior year period related to the early redemption of senior notes, as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding and lower weighted-average interest rates, partially offset by a $78 million charge recorded in the current year period related to the early redemption of senior notes.

The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income of $555 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and losses of $107 million and $242 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. The changes in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 include gains from fair value adjustments on nonmarketable equity securities in the current year periods and losses on marketable securities in the current year periods compared to gains in the prior year periods. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The increases in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 were primarily due to higher income before income taxes. We also recognized income tax expense of $498 million in the second quarter of 2021 related to an increase in our net deferred tax liability as a result of the enactment of tax law changes in the United Kingdom (see Note 9) and income tax expense in the third quarter 2020 as a result of adjustments due to other tax law changes. 19 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Stock The changes in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 were primarily due to losses at Universal Beijing Resort, which increased due to pre-opening costs prior to its opening in September 2021 (see Note 6). Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes.

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. Business customers are generally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system, with certain offerings such as Ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships. Wireless lines represent the number of activated, eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics for 2021 and 2020 do not include customers in the free Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment (refer to “Impacts of COVID-19” for further discussion). Total residential customer relationships and broadband customers were updated in the first quarter of 2021 due to a conforming change to methodology, resulting in a reduction of approximately 26,000 customers. There was no impact to net additions and information for all periods presented has been recast on a comparable basis. Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/(Decrease) 2021 2020 % 2021 2020 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 158.36 $ 154.39 2.6 % $ 158.55 $ 153.54 3.3 % Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 69.47 $ 65.99 5.3 % $ 69.39 $ 64.62 7.4 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential broadband, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin and we also use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe these metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses. 21 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment – Revenue Broadband Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to increases in the number of residential broadband customers and increases in average rates. Average rates in the second and third quarter of 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments and waived fees due to COVID-19. Refer to “Video” below for additional information. Video Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to increases in average rates, partially offset by declines in the number of residential video customers. Average rates in the second and third quarters of 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events. For customers receiving bundled services, the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle. We expect that the number of residential video customers will continue to decline, negatively impacting video revenue as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. Voice Revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to declines in the number of residential voice customers, partially offset by increases in average rates. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increases in the number of customer lines and devices sales. Business Services Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increases in average rates compared to the prior year periods and increases in the number of customers receiving our services, which were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Advertising Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 reflecting an overall market recovery in the current year periods and increases in revenue from our advanced advertising business, partially offset by decreases in political advertising compared to the prior year periods. Other Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to increases in revenue from our security and automation services and from licensing of our technology platforms. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The prior year periods include the impacts of adjustment provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events as a result of COVID-19. Excluding these adjustments, programming expenses increased due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming rates, partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers. Technical and product support expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service from increases in the sale of devices and the number of customers receiving this service. Customer service expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increased spending associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings, including advertising expenses associated with the Tokyo Olympics as well as decreased spending as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year periods. Franchise and other regulatory fees increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increases in regulatory costs. 22 Table of Contents Other operating costs and expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to decreases in bad debt expense, partially offset by higher third-party advertising costs for the nine month period. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was 43.9% and 43.8%, respectively. Our operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was 42.7% and 42.1%, respectively. While the accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in an increase to operating margins in the prior year periods. The most significant operating costs and expenses are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which increased 7.6% and 8.3% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020.

Excluding $1.2 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, advertising revenue increased due to higher pricing in the current year period, reduced spending from advertisers in the prior year period as a result of COVID-19, an increased number of sporting events and increased advertising revenue at Peacock, partially offset by continued audience ratings declines at our networks.

Ex cluding $522 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics for the three months ended September 30, 2021, distribution revenue increased due to contractual rate increases in the current year period and increases at Peacock, partially offset by declines in the number of subscribers at our television networks. Excluding $522 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, distribution revenue increased due to contractual rate increases in the current year period, credits accrued in the prior year period at some of our regional sports networks from fewer games played due to COVID-19 and increases at Peacock, partially offset by declines in the number of subscribers at our television networks. Other revenue increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to increased revenue from our digital properties. We expect the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our television networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. Revenue included $230 million and $443 million related to Peacock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Revenue included $41 million and $47 million related to Peacock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. 24 Table of Contents Media Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to increases in programming and production costs, advertising, marketing and promotion costs and other operating and administrative costs. Programming and production costs increased for the three months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to costs associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics and higher amortization expenses related to programming at Peacock in the current year period. This increase was partially offset by lower programming costs related to other sporting events due to COVID-19 timing impacts. Programming and production costs increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to costs associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics, higher programming costs related to other sporting events due to COVID-19 timing impacts and higher amortization expense related to programming at Peacock in the current year period. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs increased primarily due to higher marketing related to Peacock and higher spending related to our television networks. Other operating and administrative costs increased due to increased costs related to Peacock, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. Operating costs and expenses included $750 million and $1.6 billion related to Peacock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Operating costs and expenses included $274 million and $456 million related to Peacock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing as we invest in the platform and attract new customers.

All of our theme parks temporarily closed beginning in mid to late first quarter of 2020. Our theme park in Orlando reopened with capacity restrictions in the second quarter of 2020 and began operating without ca pacity restrictions during the end of the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood reopened with capacity restrictions early in the second quarter of 2021 and began operating without capacity restrictions by the end of that quarter. While our theme park in Japan has been reopened with capacity restrictions since the second quarter of 2020, it had a temporary closure in the second quarter of 2021. Our newest theme park in Beijing opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. 26 Table of Contents Theme Parks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to the operation of our theme parks in the current year periods compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions in the prior year periods and increased pre-opening costs and operating costs after the opening of Universal Beijing Resort in September 2021.

Customer Metrics Net Additions / (Losses) September 30, Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Total customer relationships 22,966 22,981 (233) (21) (259) (299) Customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential customers that subscribe to at least one of Sky’s four primary services of video, broadband, voice and wireless phone service. Sky reports commercial customers, including hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants, generally based on the number of locations receiving our services. In the first quarter of 2021, we implemented conforming changes to our methodology for counting commercial customers in Italy and Germany, which are now counted as described above, consistent with customers in the United Kingdom. Previously these customers were counted based on a residential equivalent unit in Italy and the number of active venues or rooms in Germany. This change resulted in a reduction in Sky’s total customer relationships of 714,000 as of December 31, 2020. The impact of the change in methodology to customer relationship net additions for any period was not material. For comparative purposes, we have updated Sky’s historical total customer relationships and average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship to reflect this adjustment.

Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 30 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of Sky’s constant currency growth rates. Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by Sky’s customers. Each of Sky’s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to-consumer service offerings. Sky Segment – Revenue Direct-to-Consumer Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue remained consistent with the prior year period for the three months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to consistent average revenue per customer relationship and customer relationships. Average revenue per customer relationship was impacted by rate increases in the United Kingdom, which were offset by declines in Italy compared to the prior year periods. Customer relationships included increases in the United Kingdom, offset by decreases in Italy compared to the prior year periods. The declines in customer relationships and average revenue per customer relationship in Italy primarily resulted from reduced broadcast rights for Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A ( “ Serie A ” ), which we had held through the end of the 2020-2021 season. Beginning with the 2021-2022 season in the third quarter of 2021 and through the 2023-2024 season, we have nonexclusive broadcast rights to fewer matches, which has resulted and we expect will continue to result in declines in revenue and customer relationships in Italy. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to increased average revenue per customer relationship. Average revenue p er customer relationship increased primarily due to rate increases in the United Kingdom and the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year period, partially offset by a decline in Italy related to Serie A. Customer relationships remained consistent with the prior year period due to increases in the United Kingdom, offset by decreases in Italy compared to the prior year period. 28 Table of Contents Content Revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to sports programming licensing revenue, which included revenue for the Union of European Football Associations Champions League in Germany and Italy and Serie A in the prior year period, as well as the timing of sporting events compared to the prior year period due to COVID-19. Revenue increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue remained consistent with the prior year period primarily due to lower revenue from sports programming licensing agreements in the current year period, offset by higher revenue from the distribution of Sky’s sports programming on third-party platforms due to the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year period. Advertising Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily reflecting an overall market recovery compared to the prior year periods. Sky Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to the timing of recognition of costs related to sporting events, including additional events in the prior year period due to COVID-19 and lower costs associated with Serie A in the current year period. Programming and production costs increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of sporting events in the current year period due to COVID-19, including the impacts of the delayed starts of the 2020-2021 European football seasons in the prior year period, partially offset by lower costs associated with Serie A in the current year period. Direct network costs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct network costs increased primarily due to increases in costs associated with Sky’s wireless phone and broadband services from increases in the sale of handsets and the number of customers receiving these services. Other expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses increased primarily due to higher fees paid to third-party channels related to advertising sales and higher marketing costs, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 in the prior year periods, as well as higher customer service costs in the current year periods, partially offset by lower personnel costs. 29 Table of Contents Corporate, Other and Eliminations Corporate and Other Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2021 2020 % 2021 2020 % Revenue $ 65 $ 44 50.9 % $ 246 $ 204 20.9 % Operating costs and expenses 400 308 30.2 1,122 1,050 7.0 Adjusted EBITDA $ (335) $ (264) (26.8) % $ (876) $ (846) (3.6) % Corporate and Other – Revenue Revenue primarily relates to Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income (loss), net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP. 30 Table of Contents Reconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 4,035 $ 2,019 $ 11,102 $ 7,154 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock (104) 12 (249) 110 Income tax expense 1,235 739 4,354 2,385 Investment and other (income) loss, net (766) 86 (2,374) 382 Interest expense 1,050 1,220 3,161 3,544 Depreciation 2,177 2,122 6,407 6,328 Amortization 1,301 1,198 3,815 3,520 Adjustments (a) 30 187 79 217 Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,957 $ 7,583 $ 26,297 $ 23,640 (a) Amounts represent the impacts of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, including Sky transaction-related costs and costs related to our investment portfolio. Amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 include $177 million related to a legal settlement. Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of September 30, 2021, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. We entered into a new revolving credit facility in March 2021 (see Note 5). We are subject to customary covenants and restrictions set forth in agreements related to debt issued at Comcast and certain of our subsidiaries, including the indentures governing our public debt securities and the credit agreements governing our revolving credit facility. Our credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit facility. Compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis under the terms of the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2021, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin and we would expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant and other covenants related to our debt. The covenants and restrictions in our revolving credit facility do not apply to certain entities, including Sky and our international theme parks. Operating Activities Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Operating income $ 15,996 $ 13,575 Depreciation and amortization 10,222 9,848 Noncash share-based compensation 1,019 922 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (1,057) 361 Payments of interest (2,943) (2,845) Payments of income taxes (2,201) (2,298) Other 420 132 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 21,457 $ 19,695 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including increased production spend partially offset by the timing of sporting events, as well as increases in accounts receivable and decreases in deferred revenue, which included the impacts of our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in the third quarter of 2021. In March 2021, we entered into an agreement with the NFL extending our rights for an additional 11 years through the 2033-2034 season. The new agreement includes exhibition rights for three additional Super Bowls and certain other rights, including streaming rights and additional exclusive games on Peacock. The decrease in income tax payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to tax deductions resulting from our senior notes exchange (refer to “ Financing Activities ” below for additional information), which reduced tax payments by $0.7 billion in the third quarter of 2021 and more than offset the higher taxable income from operations in 2021. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for both the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. Capital expenditures decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to reduced spending at our Theme Parks, partially offset by increased spending at our Cable Communications segment related to scalable infrastructur e and line extensions. Proceeds from sales of businesses and investments decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the sale of our investment in AirTouch in the prior year period. 32 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities, dividend payments, repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans and payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities, dividend payments and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares presented in other financing activities, which were partially offset by proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the settlement of cross-currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities. In August 2021, we completed a debt exchange transaction. We issued $15.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, which have maturities ranging from 2051 to 2063 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.93%, and made cash payments of $0.5 billion in exchange for $11.2 billion aggregate principal amount of certain series of outstanding senior notes with maturities ranging from 2033 to 2058 and a weighted average interest rate of 5.04%. The debt exchange transaction was accounted for as a debt modification, and therefore following the exchange, the book value of the new senior notes is equal to the book value of the exchanged senior notes reduced by the amount of the cash payments, and the difference between the principal and carrying amounts of the new senior notes will accrue through interest expense over the period to maturity of the new senior notes. In September 2021, we issued €1.75 billion ($2.1 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate Euro senior notes maturing in 2026 and 2029. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we made debt repayments totaling $9.0 billion, including $4.9 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2022 to 2023 and the early redemption of $1.3 billion of senior notes maturing in 2024, as well as amounts due at maturity and the cash payments in the debt exchange transaction. As of September 30, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding and there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Notes 5 and 6 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends In the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program. Effective May 25, 2021, our Board of Directors increased our sh are repurchase program authorization to $10 billion, which does not have an expiration date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we repurchased a total of 34.7 million shares of our Class A common stock for $2.0 billion. Under the authorizati on, we expect to repurchase additional shares during the remainder of 2021, which may be in the open market or in private transactions. In addition, we paid $620 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in our dividend to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis. On July 28, 2021, we paid dividends of $1.2 billion. In July 2021, our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, which was paid in October 2021. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. 33 Table of Contents Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Debt subject to cross-guarantees Comcast $ 88.4 $ 85.7 NBCUniversal (a) 1.6 2.8 Comcast Cable (a) 2.1 2.1 92.1 90.6 Debt subject to one-way guarantees Sky 6.4 8.4 Other (a) 0.1 2.8 6.5 11.2 Debt not guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 3.4 2.5 Other 1.1 1.1 4.5 3.6 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (5.9) (1.6) Total debt $ 97.2 $ 103.8 (a) NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 6 for additional information. Cross-guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $125 billion and $124 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $30 billion and $26 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. One-way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. 34 Table of Contents Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis; and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $95 billion and $94 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $29 billion and $23 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Following the change in presentation of our segment operating results in the first quarter of 2021, we reassessed the reporting units related to goodwill in our NBCUniversal segments and concluded that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments. See Note 2 for additional information. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We performed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights as of July 1, 2021 and no impairment was required. Our impairment testing consisted of qualitative assessments for our cable franchise rights and goodwill in our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments, and a quantitative assessment for goodwill in our Sky segment. The goodwill in our Sky segment resulted from our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018. Given this was a recent transaction, the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the Sky reporting unit. Changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Exhibits 32 SIGNATURES 33 Explanatory Note This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “NBCUniversal;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” Numerical information in this report is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC. Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • we rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comcast Corporation Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months

Corporation NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior year period to conform to classifications used in 2021. See Note 2 for a discussion of the changes in our presentation of segment operating results. Note 2: Segment Information In the first quarter of 2021, we changed our presentation of segment operating results. We now present our operations in five reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. The changes reflect a reorganized operating structure in NBCUniversal’s television and streaming businesses and primarily include: (i) the combination of NBCUniversal’s television networks (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the operations of Peacock (previously reported in Corporate and Other) in the Media segment, and (ii) the presentation of NBCUniversal’s television studio production operations (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the studio operations of Filmed Entertainment in the Studios segment. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. Cable Communications is a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services, which are marketed individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. Media consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s television and streaming platforms, including national, regional and international cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service; and various digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and digital properties; and the fees received from the distribution of our television network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers and from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. Media also generates other revenue from various digital properties. Studios consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s film and television studio production and distribution operations. Revenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our owned film and television content to broadcast, cable and premium networks, and to direct-to-consumer streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-per-view services provided by multichannel video providers and over-the-top service providers; from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters; and from the sale of owned content on DVDs, Blu-ray discs and through digital distribution services. Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, and an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Revenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our Universal theme parks. Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation subscribe to our services; from the distribution of Sky’s owned television networks on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and acquired programming to third-party video providers; and from the sale of advertising. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Our financial data by reportable segment is presented in the tables below.

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue at Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue at Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue at Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses at Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period. A summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.

As of December 31, 2020, our debt had a carrying value of $ 103.8 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 125.6 billion. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. In March 2021, we entered into a new $ 11 billion revolving credit facility due March 30, 2026 with a syndicate of banks that may be used for general corporate purposes. We may increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility up to a total of $ 14 billion, as well as extend the expiration date to no later than March 30, 2028, subject to approval of the lenders. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility consists of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcast’s credit rating. As of June 30, 2021, the borrowing margin for borrowings based on the London Interbank Offered Rate was 1.00 %. Our revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios based on debt and EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with all financial covenants for all periods presented. The new 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation revolving credit facility replaced an aggregate $ 9.2 billion of existing revolving credit facilities due May 26, 2022, which were terminated. Our revolving credit facilities were undrawn as of both June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Note 6: Significant Transactions Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. As of June 30, 2021, Universal Beijing Resort had $ 3.3 billion of debt outstanding, including $ 2.9 billion principal amount of a term loan under the debt financing agreement. As of June 30, 2021, our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort, totaling $ 8.9 billion and $ 7.1 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt.

The amount of unrealized gains (losses) recognized in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period were gains of $ 264 million and losses of $ 120 million, respectively. Investments (in millions) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Equity method $ 6,921 $ 6,006 Marketable equity securities 338 460 Nonmarketable equity securities 2,116 1,950 Other investments 131 143 Total investments 9,506 8,559 Less: Current investments 39 292 Less: Investment securing collateralized obligation 564 447 Noncurrent investments $ 8,903 $ 7,820 Equity Method Atairos Atairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $ 24 million and $ 172 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our investment in Atairos was $ 4.8 billion and $ 3.9 billion, respectively. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the 12 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation carrying value and fair value of our collateralized obligation were $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. Other Investments AirTouch In April 2020, Verizon Americas, Inc., formerly known as AirTouch Communications, Inc. (“AirTouch”), redeemed the two series of preferred stock and we received cash payments totaling $ 1.7 billion. Subsequently, we redeemed and repurchased the three series of preferred shares issued by one of our consolidated subsidiaries and made cash payments totaling $ 1.8 billion.

Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. In March 2021, we granted 12.8 million RSUs and 42.3 million stock options related to our annual management awards. The weighted-average fair values associated with these grants were $ 54.62 per RSU and $ 9.64 per stock option.

The rate change resulted in an increase to our net deferred tax liabilities of $ 498 million and a corresponding increase to income tax expense in the second quarter of 2021. Our income tax expense in the United Kingdom will be based on the new rate beginning in 2023. Cash Payments for Interest and Income Taxes Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Interest $ 1,909 $ 1,936 Income taxes $ 1,832 $ 333 Noncash Activities During the six months ended June 30, 2021: • we recognized operating lease assets and liabilities of $ 2.8 billion related to Universal Beijing Resort with lease terms of 33 years and using a weighted average discount rate of 4.4 % • we acquired $ 1.5 billion of property and equipment and intangible assets that were accrued but unpaid • we recorded a liability of $ 1.2 billion for a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.25 per common share paid in July 2021 During the six months ended June 30, 2020: • we acquired $ 1.8 billion of property and equipment and intangible assets that were accrued but unpaid • we recorded a liability of $ 1.1 billion for a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.23 per common share paid in July 2020 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheet to the total of the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows.

As of December 31, 2020, the preferred stock had a carrying value equal to its liquidation preference and was presented in redeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock. Contingencies We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation. 14 Table of Contents ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Refer to Note 2 for information on our reportable segments, including a description of the segment change implemented in the first quarter of 2021. All amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Impacts of COVID-19 The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such impact will depend on restrictive governmental measures, U.S. and global economic conditions, expanded availability and acceptance of vaccines and consumer behavior in response to COVID-19. The most significant effects of COVID-19 began in the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses. Cable Communications • Beginning in March 2020, new qualifying customers for Internet Essentials, our low-income internet adoption program, receive 60 days of free broadband services. Our customer metrics do not include customers in the free Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment as a result of COVID-19 programs. The number of customers excluded from our customer metrics has continued to decrease as some of these customers either began paying for service, resulting in customer net additions, or disconnected and no longer receive service, and we expect this to continue in future periods. We have experienced improvement in customer collections; however, we believe there continues to be a risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables as a result of COVID-19. NBCUniversal • Our theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood were operating without capacity restrictions as of the end of the second quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our theme park in Japan was temporarily closed for a period in the second quarter of 2021, but was reopened and operating with capacity restrictions as of the end of the quarter. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 on a consolidated basis. We expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted and we cannot predict if our parks will remain open or be subject to capacity restrictions, or the level of attendance at our reopened parks. We currently expect that Universal Beijing Resort will open later in 2021. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in the first quarter of 2021. • Delays to the start of seasons for certain professional sports leagues, including the 2020-2021 NHL and NBA seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year, which impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. We expect the timing of sports seasons to generally return to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs. • Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. With the temporary closure and limited capacity operation of many movie theaters worldwide, we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally. Delays in theatrical releases affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows. We expect results of 15 Table of Contents operations in our Studios segment to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19. Sky • Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers ’ locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-2021 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. We expect the timing of sports seasons to generally return to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In 2020, our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives, with the most significant relating to severance at NBCUniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base. The costs of these initiatives were presented in Corporate and Other. Payments related to NBCUniversal employee severance are expected to be completed in 2021 and the related costs savings will be realized in operating costs and expenses primarily beginning in 2021. A portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives.

Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $586 million and $1.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $565 million and $1.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding, partially offset by a $78 million charge recorded in the current period related to the early redemption of senior notes due 2024. Interest expense decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a $140 million charge recorded in the prior year period related to the early redemption of senior notes, as well as a decrease in average debt outstanding, partially offset by a $78 million charge recorded in the current period related to the early redemption of senior notes due 2024.

The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income of $883 million and $960 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and income of $446 million and losses of $135 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. 17 Table of Contents Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The increases in income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 were primarily due to higher income before income taxes. We also recognized income tax expense of $498 million related to an increase in our net deferred tax liability as a result of the enactment of tax law changes in the United Kingdom in the second quarter of 2021. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes.

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. Business customers are generally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system, with certain offerings such as Ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships. Wireless lines represent the number of activated, eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics for 2021 and 2020 do not include customers in the free Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment (refer to “Impacts of COVID-19” for further discussion). Total residential customer relationships and broadband customers were updated in the first quarter of 2021 due to a conforming change to methodology, resulting in a reduction of approximately 26,000 customers. There was no impact to net additions and information for all periods presented have been recast on a comparable basis. Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease) 2021 2020 % 2021 2020 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 158.53 $ 150.29 5.5 % $ 158.45 $ 153.74 3.1 % Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 70.07 $ 64.33 8.9 % $ 69.26 $ 64.18 7.9 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential broadband, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin and we also use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe these metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential broadband and business services. 19 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment – Revenue Broadband Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to increases in the number of residential broadband customers and increases in average rates. Average rates in the second quarter of 2020 were negatively impacted by waived fees due to COVID-19 and the impacts of customer adjustments. Refer to “Video” below for further information. Video Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to increases in average rates, partially offset by declines in the number of residential video customers. Average rates in the second quarter of 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events. For customers receiving bundled services, the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle. We expect that the number of residential video customers will continue to decline, negatively impacting video revenue as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. Voice Revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to declines in the number of residential voice customers, partially offset by increases in average rates. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increases in the number of customer lines and sales of devices. Business Services Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increases in average rates compared to the prior year periods, which were negatively impacted by COVID-19, and increases in the number of customers receiving our services. Advertising Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 reflecting an overall market recovery in the current year periods and reduced spending from advertisers in the prior year periods as a result of COVID-19. Other Revenue increased for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to increases in revenue from our security and automation services and from the licensing of our technology platforms. Revenue increased for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to an increase in the licensing of our technology platforms. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. The prior year periods include the impacts of adjustment provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events as a result of COVID-19. Excluding these adjustments, programming expenses increased due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming rates, partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers. We anticipate that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases to a greater extent in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the timing of contract renewals, partially offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers. Technical and product support expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service, partially offset by lower personnel costs. Customer service expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of cost savings initiatives and reduced call volumes. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to decreased spending as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year periods. 20 Table of Contents Franchise and other regulatory fees increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to increases in regulatory costs. Other operating costs and expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to decreases in bad debt expense, partially offset by higher third-party advertising costs. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential broadband and business services, and on improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 was and 44.2% and 43.7%, respectively. Our operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was 42.8% and 41.7%, respectively. While the accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in an increase to operating margins in the prior year periods. The most significant operating costs and expenses are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which increased 12.1% and 8.7% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2020.

Advertising revenue increased primarily due to an increased number of sporting events and higher pricing in the current year periods, reduced spending from advertisers in the prior year periods as a result of COVID-19 and increased advertising revenue at Peacock. These increases were partially offset by continued audience ratings declines at our networks. Distribution revenue increased due to contractual rate increases in the current year periods and credits accrued in the prior year periods at some of our regional sports networks resulting from the reduced number of games played by professional sports leagues due to COVID-19, partially offset by declines in the number of subscribers at our networks. Other revenue increased primarily due to increased revenue from our digital properties. We expect the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. Revenue included $122 million and $213 million related to Peacock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Revenue included $6 million related to Peacock for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. Media Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 due to increases in programming and production costs, advertising, marketing and promotion costs and other operating and administrative costs. Programming and production costs increased primarily due to higher sports programming costs driven by increases in the number of sporting events as a result of the postponement and cancellation of events in the prior year as a result of COVID-19 and higher amortization expenses in the current year periods related to programming at Peacock. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs increased primarily due to higher marketing related to Peacock, which was partially offset by lower spend related to our networks in the six month period. Other operating and administrative costs increased due to increased costs related to Peacock, partially offset by cost savings initiatives in the six month period. Operating costs and expenses included $485 million and $853 million related to Peacock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. Operating costs and expenses included $123 million and $182 million related to Peacock for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing as we invest in the platform and attract new customers.

Theatrical revenue increased primarily due to releases in the current year period, including F9 , and the impact of theater closures in the prior year period . Content licensing revenue increased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios under licensing agreements, partially offset by decreases at our film studios as a result of COVID-19 and the impacts of initial licenses of content associated with the launch of Peacock in the prior year period. Home entertainment and other revenue decreased primarily due to a reduced number of releases in the current year period due to COVID-19. Revenue increased for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to an increase in content licensing revenue, offset by decreases in theatrical revenue and home entertainment and other revenue. Content licensing revenue increased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios under licensing agreements, including a new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock during the first quarter of 2021. Theatrical revenue decreased primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the operation of movie theaters. Home entertainment and other revenue decreased primarily due to a reduced number of releases in the current year period due to COVID-19. Studios Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to increases in programming and production costs and advertising, marketing and promotion costs. Programming and production costs increased primarily due to higher amortization associated with content licensing sales in the current year period, as well as the impact from the updated accounting guidance related to episodic television series, which was adopted and had a favorable impact on programming and production expense in the prior year period. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs increased due to higher spending on theatrical releases in the current year period. Operating costs and expenses increased for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to increases in programming and production costs, partially offset by decreases in advertising, marketing and promotion costs and other operating and administrative costs. Programming and production costs increased primarily due to higher amortization associated with content licensing sales, including the new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock during the first quarter of 2021, as well as the impact from the updated accounting guidance related to episodic television series in the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization associated with theatrical releases in the current year period. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs decreased due to lower spending on theatrical film releases in the current year period. Other operating and administrative costs decreased due to cost savings initiatives.

All of our theme parks temporarily closed beginning in mid to late first quarter of 2020. Our theme park in Orlando reopened with capacity restrictions in the second quarter of 2020 and was operating without capacity restrictions as of the end of the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood reopened with capacity restrictions early in the second quarter of 2021 and was operating without capacity restrictions as of the end of the quarter. Our theme park in Japan reopened with capacity restrictions in the second quarter of 2020, was temporarily closed for a period in the second quarter of 2021 and has reopened, with capacity restrictions as of the end of the quarter. Theme Parks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 primarily due to the operation of our theme parks in the current year periods compared to temporary closures and capacity 23 Table of Contents restrictions in the prior year periods, as well as increased pre-opening costs associated with Universal Beijing Resort. We expect to incur additional pre-opening costs ahead of the expected opening of Universal Beijing Resort later in 2021.

Current year amounts include the impact of a new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock during the first quarter of 2021, and prior year amounts include the impacts of initial licenses of content associated with the launch of Peacock. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 33% and 44%, respectively, of Studios segment content licensing revenue resulted from transactions with other segments, primarily with the Media segment. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, approximately 36% and 33%, respectively, of Studios segment content licensing revenue resulted from transactions with other segments, primarily with the Media segment. Eliminations will increase or decrease to the extent that additional content is made available to our other segments. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of transactions between our segments.

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential customers that subscribe to at least one of Sky’s four primary services of video, broadband, voice and wireless phone service. Sky reports commercial customers, including hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants, generally based on the number of locations receiving our services. In the first quarter of 2021, we implemented conforming changes to our methodology for counting commercial customers in Italy and Germany, which are now counted as described above, consistent with customers in the United Kingdom. Previously these customers were counted based on a residential equivalent unit in Italy and the number of active venues or rooms in Germany. This change resulted in a reduction in Sky’s total customer relationships of 714,000 as of December 31, 2020. The impact of the change in methodology to customer relationship net additions for any period was not material. For comparative purposes, we have updated Sky’s historical total customer relationships and average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship to reflect this adjustment. Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Constant Currency Growth (a) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Constant Currency Growth (a) 2021 2020 % % 2021 2020 % % Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship $ 60.35 $ 50.82 18.8 % 6.7 % $ 59.50 $ 51.87 14.7 % 4.4 % (a) Constant currency growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 26 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of Sky’s constant currency growth rates. Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by Sky’s customers. Each of Sky’s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to-consumer service offerings. Sky Segment – Revenue Direct-to-Consumer Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to increases in average revenue per customer relationship and customer relationships. The increases in average revenue per customer relationship were primarily due to the impacts of the postponement of sporting events in the prior year periods as a result of COVID-19 and rate increases in the United Kingdom. Content Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from sports programming licensing arrangements and from the distribution of Sky’s sports programming on third-party platforms, both reflecting the postponement of sporting events in the prior year periods as a result of COVID-19. Advertising Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily reflecting an overall market recovery and an increased number of sporting events in the current year periods, and reduced spending from advertisers in the prior year periods, as a result of COVID-19. Sky Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs increased primarily due to increases in the number of sporting events in the current year periods due to COVID-19, including the impacts of the delayed starts of the 2020-2021 European football seasons and the disrupted seasons in the first and second quarters of 2020. We held the Italian broadcast rights to Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A through the end of the 2020-2021 season. Beginning with the 2021-2022 season and through the 2023-2024 season, we will have nonexclusive broadcast rights to a reduced number of matches, which will result in a reduction in programming and production costs and we expect will result in declines in revenue and customer relationships in Italy. Direct network costs increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct network costs increased primarily due to increases in costs associated with 25 Table of Contents Sky’s wireless phone and broadband services as a result of increases in the sale of handsets and the number of customers receiving these services. Other expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses increased primarily due to higher fees paid to third-party channels related to advertising sales and higher marketing costs, both reflecting the impact of COVID-19 in the prior year periods, partially offset by lower personnel costs.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 26 Table of Contents We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income (loss), net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods. 27 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Sky Constant Currency Growth Rates Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Actual Constant Currency Constant Currency Growth Actual Constant Currency Constant Currency Growth (in millions, except per customer data) 2021 2020 % 2021 2020 % Revenue Direct-to-consumer $ 4,222 $ 3,921 7.7 % $ 8,288 $ 7,914 4.7 % Content 355 261 36.1 713 613 16.3 Advertising 643 359 78.8 1,216 914 33.0 Total revenue 5,220 4,541 14.9 10,217 9,441 8.2 Operating costs and expenses Programming and production 2,447 1,716 42.6 4,931 3,956 24.7 Direct network costs 625 561 11.4 1,256 1,054 19.2 Other 1,589 1,437 10.6 3,107 3,002 3.5 Total operating costs and expenses 4,660 3,714 25.5 9,294 8,012 16.0 Adjusted EBITDA $ 560 $ 828 (32.4) % $ 924 $ 1,429 (35.4) % Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship $ 60.35 $ 56.56 6.7 % $ 59.50 $ 57.00 4.4 % Liquidity and Capital Resources Our businesses generate significant cash flows from operating activities. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of June 30, 2021, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. We entered into a new revolving credit facility in March 2021 (see Note 5). We are subject to customary covenants and restrictions set forth in agreements related to debt issued at Comcast and certain of our subsidiaries, including the indentures governing our public debt securities and the credit agreements governing the Comcast revolving credit facility. Our credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility. Compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis under the terms of the credit facility. As of June 30, 2021, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin and we would expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant and other covenants related to our debt. The covenants and restrictions in our revolving credit facility do not apply to certain entities, including Sky and our international theme parks. Operating Activities Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2021 2020 Operating income $ 10,546 $ 9,499 Depreciation and amortization 6,745 6,528 Noncash share-based compensation 711 621 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 892 (15) Payments of interest (1,909) (1,936) Payments of income taxes (1,832) (333) Other 204 103 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 15,357 $ 14,467 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including the 28 Table of Contents timing of sporting events partially offset by increased production spend, as well as increases in deferred revenue and accounts receivable. In March 2021, we entered into an agreement with the NFL extending our rights for an additional 11 years through the 2033-2034 season. The new agreement includes exhibition rights for three additional Super Bowls and certain other rights, including streaming rights and additional exclusive games on Peacock. The increase in income tax payments for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to the extension of due dates for estimated second quarter 2020 federal income tax payments to the third quarter of 2020. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for both the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. Capital expenditures increased for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to increased spending at our Cable Communications segment related to scalable infrastructure, customer premise equipment and line extensions. NBCUniversal capital expenditures decreased as a result of reduced spending at our Theme Parks. Proceeds from sales of businesses and investments decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the sale of our investment in AirTouch in the prior year period. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2021 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, dividend payments, repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans and payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, dividend payments and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares presented in other financing activities, which were partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, we made debt repayments totaling $5.8 billion, including $4.0 billion of optional repayments of term loans due 2022 to 2023 and the early redemption of $1.3 billion of senior notes maturing in 2024. As of June 30, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding and there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Notes 5 and 6 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends In the second quarter of 2021, we restarted our share repurchase program. Effective May 25, 2021, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion, which does not have an expiration date. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, we repurchased a total of 8.8 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500 million. Under the authorization, we expect to repurchase additional shares during the remainder of 2021, which may be in the open market or in private transactions. In addition, we paid $459 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in our dividend to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis. On April 28, 2021, we paid dividends of $1.2 billion. In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved our second quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, which was paid in July 2021. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. 29 Table of Contents Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Debt subject to cross-guarantees Comcast $ 81.6 $ 85.7 NBCUniversal (a) 2.8 2.8 Comcast Cable (a) 2.1 2.1 86.5 90.6 Debt subject to one-way guarantees Sky 8.3 8.4 Other (a) 1.0 2.8 9.3 11.2 Debt not guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 3.3 2.5 Other 1.1 1.1 4.4 3.6 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (1.6) (1.6) Total debt $ 98.6 $ 103.8 (a) NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 6 for additional information. Cross-guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $125 billion and $124 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $28 billion and $26 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. One-way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis; and are 30 Table of Contents structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $97 billion and $94 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $25 billion and $23 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Following the change in presentation of our segment operating results in the first quarter of 2021, we reassessed the reporting units related to goodwill in our NBCUniversal segments and concluded that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments. See Note 2 for additional information. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Exhibits 30 SIGNATURES 31 Explanatory Note This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “NBCUniversal;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes statements that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. These may include estimates, projections and statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, which are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “potential,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “commit,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. In evaluating forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties we describe in the “Risk Factors” sections of our Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other reports we file with the SEC. Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • we rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 1: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Comcast Corporation Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions,

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior year period to conform to classifications used in 2021. See Note 2 for a discussion of the changes in our presentation of segment operating results. Note 2: Segment Information In the first quarter of 2021, we changed our presentation of segment operating results. We now present our operations in five reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. The changes reflect a reorganized operating structure in NBCUniversal’s television and streaming businesses and primarily include: (i) the combination of NBCUniversal’s television networks (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the operations of Peacock (previously reported in Corporate and Other) in the Media segment, and (ii) the presentation of NBCUniversal’s television studio production operations (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the studio operations of Filmed Entertainment in the Studios segment. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. Cable Communications is a leading provider of broadband, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services, which are marketed individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. Media consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s television and streaming platforms, including national, regional and international cable networks; the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations; Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service; and various digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of advertising on our television networks, Peacock and digital properties; and the fees received from the distribution of our television network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers and from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. Media also generates other revenue from various digital properties. Studios consists primarily of NBCUniversal’s film and television studio production and distribution operations. Revenue is generated primarily from the licensing of our owned film and television content to broadcast, cable and premium networks, and to direct-to-consumer streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand and pay-per-view services provided by multichannel video providers and over-the-top service providers; from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters; and from the sale of owned content on DVDs, Blu-ray discs and through digital distribution services. Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, and an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Revenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our Universal theme parks. Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, broadband, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation subscribe to our services; from the distribution of Sky’s owned television networks on third-party platforms and the licensing of owned and acquired programming to third-party video providers; and from the sale of advertising. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below. Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 15,805 $ 6,830 $ 1,929 $ 1,370 $ 315 NBCUniversal Media 5,036 1,473 247 10 32 Studios 2,396 497 12 1 2 Theme Parks 619 ( 61 ) 207 126 6 Headquarters and Other 16 ( 209 ) 117 35 28 Eliminations (a) ( 1,043 ) ( 210 ) — — — NBCUniversal 7,024 1,490 583 172 68 Sky 4,997 364 814 271 201 Corporate and Other 89 ( 281 ) 36 46 28 Eliminations (a) ( 710 ) 10 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 27,205 $ 8,413 $ 3,362 $ 1,859 $ 612 Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 (in millions) Revenue (a) Adjusted EBITDA (b) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 14,918 $ 6,076 $ 1,946 $ 1,269 $ 356 NBCUniversal Media 4,878 1,529 243 31 38 Studios 2,409 300 17 4 1 Theme Parks 925 87 190 296 15 Headquarters and Other 9 ( 221 ) 116 46 41 Eliminations (a) ( 492 ) ( 6 ) — — — NBCUniversal 7,729 1,689 566 377 95 Sky 4,517 551 718 197 166 Corporate and Other 120 ( 193 ) 34 38 1 Eliminations (a) ( 675 ) 7 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 26,609 $ 8,130 $ 3,264 $ 1,881 $ 618 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation (a) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue at Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue at Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue at Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses at Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period. A summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.

As of December 31, 2020, our debt had a carrying value of $ 103.8 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 125.6 billion. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. In March 2021, we entered into a new $ 11 billion revolving credit facility due March 30, 2026 with a syndicate of banks that may be used for general corporate purposes. We may increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility up to a total of $ 14 billion, as well as extend the expiration date to no later than March 30, 2028, subject to approval of the lenders. The interest rate on the revolving credit facility consists of a base rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcast’s credit rating. As of March 31, 2021, the borrowing margin for borrowings based on the London Interbank Offered Rate was 1.00 %. Our revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios based on debt and EBITDA, as defined in the revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with all financial covenants for all periods presented. The new 10 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation revolving credit facility replaced an aggregate $ 9.2 billion of existing revolving credit facilities due May 26, 2022, which were terminated. Our revolving credit facilities were undrawn as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Note 6: Significant Transactions Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. As of March 31, 2021, Universal Beijing Resort had $ 3.0 billion of debt outstanding, including $ 2.7 billion principal amount of a term loan under the debt financing agreement. As of March 31, 2021, our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort, totaling $ 8.5 billion and $ 6.8 billion, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Universal Beijing Resort primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease assets and liabilities, and debt. Note 7: Investments Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 136 $ ( 668 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 237 ( 58 ) Other income (loss), net 17 10 Investment and other income (loss), net $ 390 $ ( 716 ) The amount of unrealized gains (losses) recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 that related to marketable and nonmarketable equity securities still held as of the end of each reporting period were gains of $ 98 million and losses of $ 59 million, respectively.

We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For both the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $ 12 million. As of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our investment in Atairos was $ 3.9 billion. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying value and fair value of our collateralized obligation were $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value.

Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. In March 2021, we granted 12.8 million RSUs and 42.3 million stock options related to our annual management awards. The weighted-average fair values associated with these grants were $ 54.62 per RSU and $ 9.64 per stock option.

As of December 31, 2020, the preferred stock had a carrying value equal to its liquidation preference and was presented in redeemable noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock. Contingencies We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation. 13 Table of Conten ts ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Refer to Note 2 for information on our reportable segments, including a description of the segment change implemented in the first quarter of 2021. All amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Impacts of COVID-19 The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. COVID-19 has had, and we expect will continue to have, material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively. We expect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such impact will depend on restrictive governmental measures, further deterioration of the global economy, widespread availability and acceptance of vaccines and consumer behavior in response to COVID-19. The most significant effects of COVID-19 began in the second half of the first quarter of 2020. The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses. Cable Communications • Beginning in March 2020 and continuing through June 2021, new qualifying customers for Internet Essentials, our low-income internet adoption program, receive 60 days of free broadband services. Our customer metrics do not include customers in the free Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment as a result of COVID-19 programs. The number of customers excluded from our customer metrics has continued to decrease as some of these customers either began paying for service, resulting in customer net additions, or disconnected and no longer receive service, and we expect this to continue in future periods. We also believe there continues to be a risk associated with collections on customer accounts. NBCUniversal • In the first quarter of 2021, our theme parks in Orlando and Japan were open with limited capacity while our park in Hollywood remained closed. In April 2021, our theme park in Hollywood reopened with limited capacity, but our theme park in Japan has temporarily closed. The limited capacity and closure of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2021 on a consolidated basis. We expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted and we cannot predict if any parks will remain open or the level of attendance at our reopened parks. We currently expect that Universal Beijing Resort will open during summer 2021 and we have resumed the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando in the first quarter of 2021. • Delays to the start of current seasons for certain professional sports leagues, including the NHL and NBA, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first quarter of 2021, which impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, since both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. We also expect additional events in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. We cannot predict the ultimate timing of when, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur in future periods. In addition, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics have been postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs. • Our studio production operations have resumed, with some at a limited capacity. Additionally, with the temporary closure and limited-capacity operation of many movie theaters worldwide, we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally. Delays in theatrical releases will affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows. We expect results of operations in our Studios segment to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19. 14 Table of Conten ts Sky • Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the extent of reopening of our commercial customers. In addition, delays to the start of the current seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first quarter of 2021. We also expect additional events in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. We cannot predict the ultimate timing of when, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur in future periods. In 2020, our businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives, with the most significant relating to severance at NBCUniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base. The costs of these initiatives were presented in Corporate and Other. Payments related to NBCUniversal employee severance are expected to be completed in 2021 and the related costs savings will be realized in operating costs and expenses primarily beginning in 2021. A portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives.

Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 24 for additional information, including our definition and our use of Adjusted EBITDA, and for a reconciliation from net income attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA. Consolidated Revenue Cable Communications, Sky and Media drove increases in consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which were partially offset by decreases in revenue in Theme Parks and Studios. Revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Costs and Expenses Sky, Media and Cable Communications drove increases in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which were partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses in Studios and Theme Parks. Operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, businesses development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” 15 Table of Conten ts Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2021 2020 % Cable Communications $ 1,929 $ 1,946 (0.9) % NBCUniversal 583 566 3.0 Sky 814 718 13.3 Corporate and Other 36 34 6.4 Comcast Consolidated $ 3,362 $ 3,264 3.0 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to increased amortization expense at Sky due to the impact of foreign currency . Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $592 million and $575 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a $140 million charge recorded in the prior year period related to the early redemption of senior notes, as well as lower weighted-average interest rates in the current year period. Consolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 136 $ (668) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 237 (58) Other income (loss), net 17 10 Total investment and other income (loss), net $ 390 $ (716) The change in investment and other income (loss) net for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to equity in net income (losses) of investees, net related to our investment in Atairos Group, Inc. and realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net related to fair value adjustments for nonmarketable equity securities. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments with income of $77 million and losses of $581 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to higher income before income taxes. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes. 16 Table of Conten ts Cable Communications Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2021 2020 $ % Revenue Residential: Broadband $ 5,600 $ 5,001 $ 599 12.0 % Video 5,623 5,632 (9) (0.2) Voice 871 899 (28) (3.1) Wireless 513 343 170 49.7 Business services 2,167 2,043 124 6.1 Advertising 618 557 61 10.8 Other 413 443 (30) (6.7) Total revenue 15,805 14,918 887 5.9 Operating costs and expenses Programming 3,670 3,479 191 5.5 Technical and product support 2,021 2,012 9 0.4 Customer service 602 637 (35) (5.5) Advertising, marketing and promotion 905 954 (49) (5.2) Franchise and other regulatory fees 501 406 95 23.4 Other 1,276 1,354 (78) (5.8) Total operating costs and expenses 8,975 8,842 133 1.5 Adjusted EBITDA $ 6,830 $ 6,076 $ 754 12.4 % 17 Table of Conten ts Customer Metrics Net Additions March 31, Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Customer relationships Residential customer relationships 31,062 29,483 370 360 Business services customer relationships 2,437 2,408 11 11 Total customer relationships 33,499 31,891 380 371 Residential customer relationships mix One product customers 12,997 10,775 589 554 Two product customers 8,645 8,848 (89) (75) Three or more product customers 9,420 9,860 (130) (119) Broadband Residential customers 28,774 26,854 448 466 Business services customers 2,261 2,226 12 11 Total broadband customers 31,034 29,080 461 477 Video Residential customers 18,590 19,900 (404) (388) Business services customers 765 944 (87) (22) Total video customers 19,355 20,845 (491) (409) Voice Residential customers 9,533 9,840 (112) (94) Business services customers 1,363 1,347 6 5 Total voice customers 10,896 11,187 (106) (89) Wireless Wireless lines 3,103 2,267 278 216 Customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential broadband and video customer metrics include certain customers that have prepaid for services. Business customers are generally counted based on the number of locations receiving services within our distribution system, with certain offerings such as Ethernet network services counted as individual customer relationships. Wireless lines represent the number of activated, eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics for 2021 and 2020 do not include customers in the free Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment (refer to “Impacts of COVID-19” for further discussion). Total residential customer relationships and broadband customers were updated in the first quarter of 2021 due to a conforming change to methodology, resulting in a reduction of approximately 26,000 customers. There was no impact to net additions and information for all periods presented have been recast on a comparable basis. Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2021 2020 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 158.17 $ 156.84 0.8 % Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 68.35 $ 63.88 7.0 % Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential broadband, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin and we also use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe these metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential broadband and business services. 18 Table of Conten ts Cable Communications Segment – Revenue Broadband Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to an increase in the number of residential broadband customers and an increase in average rates. Video Revenue was flat for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to a decline in the number of residential video customers, offset by an increase in average rates. We expect that the number of residential video customers will continue to decline, negatively impacting video revenue as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. Voice Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the number of residential voice customers. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to increases in the number of customer lines and sales of devices. Business Services Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in average rates and an increase in the number of customers receiving our services. Advertising Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in revenue from our advanced advertising business and from recent acquisitions. Other Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to decreases in certain billing and collection fees and a decrease in revenue from our security and automation business. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in retransmission consent fees, partially offset by a decline in the number of video customers. We anticipate that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases to a greater extent in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the timing of contract renewals, partially offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers. Technical and product support expenses were flat for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service, offset by lower personnel costs. Customer service expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of cost savings initiatives and reduced call volumes. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the costs associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings. Franchise and other regulatory fees increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in regulatory costs. Other operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential broadband and business services, and on improving overall operating cost management. 19 Table of Conten ts Our operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was 43.2% and 40.7%, respectively. The most significant operating costs and expenses are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which increased 5.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.

Distribution revenue increased due to contractual rate increases, partially offset by declines in the number of subscribers at our networks. Other revenue increased primarily due to an increase in revenue from our digital properties. Advertising revenue decreased primarily due to continued audience ratings declines at our networks, partially offset by higher prices for advertising units sold, an increase in the number of units sold related to sports and an increase in advertising revenue at Peacock. We expect the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our networks to continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. Revenue included $91 million related to Peacock for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Media Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to an increase in programming and production costs, partially offset by decreases in other operating and administrative costs and advertising, marketing and promotion costs. Programming and production costs increased primarily due to higher amortization expense related to programming at Peacock. Programming and production costs at our television networks increased slightly, reflecting higher sports programming costs driven by an increase in the number of sporting events offset by a decrease in 20 Table of Conten ts entertainment programming costs from delays in production due to COVID-19. Other operating and administrative costs decreased due to cost savings initiatives, partially offset by increased costs related to Peacock. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs decreased due to lower spending on marketing related to our networks, partially offset by higher marketing related to Peacock. Operating costs and expenses included $368 million and $59 million related to Peacock for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing for the new platform.

Theatrical revenue decreased primarily due to the deferral of theatrical releases due to the temporary closure and limited-capacity operation of many movie theaters due to COVID-19 . Content licensing revenue increased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements, including a new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock during the quarter. Studios Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to decreases in advertising, marketing and promotion costs and other operating and administrative costs, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs. Advertising, marketing and promotion costs decreased due to lower spending on theatrical film releases in the current year period. Other operating and administrative costs decreased due to cost savings initiatives. Programming and production costs increased primarily due to higher amortization associated with content licensing sales, including the new licensing agreement for content that became exclusively available for streaming on Peacock during the quarter, as well as the impact from the updated accounting guidance related to episodic television series, which was adopted and had a favorable impact on programming and production expense in the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization associated with theatrical film releases in the current year period. Theme Parks Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2021 2020 $ % Revenue $ 619 $ 925 $ (306) (33.1) % Operating costs and expenses 680 838 (158) (18.8) Adjusted EBITDA $ (61) $ 87 $ (148) (170.9) % Theme Parks Segment – Revenue Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to the temporary limited-capacity operation and closures of our theme parks as a result of COVID-19. Our theme parks closed beginning in late February 2020 in Japan and mid-March 2020 in Orlando and Hollywood. Our theme parks in Orlando and Japan reopened with 21 Table of Conten ts limited-capacity in June 2020, while our theme park in Hollywood remained closed through the first quarter of 2021. In April 2021, our theme park in Hollywood reopened with limited capacity, but our theme park in Japan has temporarily closed. Theme Parks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to decreases in costs related to park operations due to the temporary limited-capacity operation and closures and lower marketing-related costs, partially offset by increased pre-opening costs associated with Universal Beijing Resort. We expect to incur significant additional pre-opening costs ahead of the expected opening of Universal Beijing Resort later in 2021.

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, eliminations of revenue and operating costs and expenses increased as a result of licensing of content between our Studios and Media segments, including transactions with Peacock. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 52% and 30% of Studios segment content licensing revenue resulted from transactions with other segments, primarily with the Media segment. Eliminations will increase or decrease to the extent that additional content is made available to our other segments. Refer to Note 2 for further description of transactions between our segments.

Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 24 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of Sky’s constant currency growth rates. 22 Table of Conten ts Customer Metrics Net Additions March 31, Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Total customer relationships 23,446 23,216 221 (65) Customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential customers that subscribe to at least one of Sky’s four primary services of video, broadband, voice and wireless phone service. Sky reports commercial customers, including hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants, generally based on the number of locations receiving our services. In the first quarter of 2021, we implemented conforming changes to our methodology for counting commercial customers in Italy and Germany, which are now counted as described above, consistent with customers in the United Kingdom. Previously these customers were counted based on a residential equivalent unit in Italy and the number of active venues or rooms in Germany. This change resulted in a reduction in Sky’s total customer relationships of 714,000 as of December 31, 2020. The impact of the change in methodology to customer relationship net additions for any period was not material. For comparative purposes, we have updated Sky’s historical total customer relationships and average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship to reflect this adjustment. Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) Constant Currency Growth (a) 2021 2020 % % Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship $ 58.06 $ 52.76 10.0 % 1.4 % (a) Constant currency growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 24 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of Sky’s constant currency growth rates. Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by Sky’s customers. Each of Sky’s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to-consumer service offerings. Sky Segment – Revenue Direct-to-Consumer Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to increases in average revenue per customer relationship and customer relationships. Content Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from the distribution of Sky’s sports programming on third-party platforms, reflecting the negative impact of COVID-19 in the prior year period. Advertising Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased primarily due to higher advanced advertising revenue in the United Kingdom. Sky Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs increased primarily due to an increase in the number of sporting events in the current year period due to COVID-19, including the impacts of the delayed starts of the current European football seasons and the disrupted seasons in the first quarter of 2020. We currently hold Italian broadcast rights to Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A through the end of the 2020-2021 season. It is uncertain whether we will retain any broadcast or other rights related to future seasons, which would result in a reduction in programming and production costs and may result in a decline in customer relationships in Italy. Direct network costs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct network costs increased primarily due to an increase in costs associated with Sky’s wireless phone and broadband services as a result of increases in the sale of handsets and the number of customers receiving these services. Other expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses decreased primarily due to lower personnel costs. 23 Table of Conten ts Corporate, Other and Eliminations Corporate and Other Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2021 2020 $ % Revenue $ 89 $ 120 $ (31) (26.1) % Operating costs and expenses 382 327 55 16.6 Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs (12) (14) 2 NM Adjusted EBITDA $ (281) $ (193) $ (88) (45.3) % Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 24 Table of Conten ts We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income (loss), net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of March 31, 2021, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $11.0 billion. We entered into a new revolving credit facility in March 2021 (see Note 5). We are subject to customary covenants and restrictions set forth in agreements related to debt issued at Comcast and certain of our subsidiaries, including the indentures governing our public debt securities and the credit agreements governing the Comcast revolving credit facility. Our credit facility contains a financial covenant pertaining to leverage, which is the ratio of debt to EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility. Compliance with this financial covenant is tested on a quarterly basis under the terms of the credit facility. As of March 31, 2021, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin and we would expect to remain in compliance with this financial covenant and other covenants related to our debt. The covenants and restrictions in our revolving credit facility do not apply to certain entities, including Sky and our international theme parks. Operating Activities Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2021 2020 Operating income $ 5,039 $ 4,852 Depreciation and amortization 3,362 3,264 Noncash share-based compensation 373 298 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (176) (1,393) Payments of interest (911) (991) Payments of income taxes (87) (281) Other 151 75 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,751 $ 5,824 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 was primarily due to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including the timing of sporting events, and collections of accounts receivables and increases in deferred revenue. In March 2021, we entered into an agreement with the NFL extending our rights for an additional 11 years through the 2033-2034 season. The new agreement includes exhibition rights for three additional Super Bowls and certain other rights, including streaming rights and additional exclusive games on Peacock. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort. Capital expenditures decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in spending in our Theme Parks segment, partially offset by an increase in spending related to scalable infrastructure in our Cable Communications segment to increase network capacity. Proceeds from sales of businesses and investments increased for the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the sale of marketable equity securities. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 consisted primarily of dividend payments, payments related to the redemption of NBCUniversal Enterprise redeemable subsidiary preferred stock presented in other financing activities and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans. Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of proceeds from borrowings, including the issuance of senior 26 Table of Conten ts notes, partially offset by repayments of debt, including the early redemption of senior notes, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans. As of March 31, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding and there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Notes 5 and 6 for additional information on our financing activities. Dividends In January 2021, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in our dividend to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis. In January 2021, our Board of Directors approved our first quarter dividend of $0.25 per share, which was paid in April 2021. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. On January 27, 2021, we paid dividends of $1.1 billion. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Debt subject to cross-guarantees Comcast $ 85.6 $ 85.7 NBCUniversal (a) 2.8 2.8 Comcast Cable (a) 2.1 2.1 90.5 90.6 Debt subject to one-way guarantees Sky 8.2 8.4 Other (a) 2.5 2.8 10.7 11.2 Debt not guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 3.0 2.5 Other 1.2 1.1 4.2 3.6 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (1.7) (1.6) Total debt $ 103.7 $ 103.8 (a) NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 6 for additional information. Cross-guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. 27 Table of Conten ts The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $125 billion and $124 billion, respectively, and for both periods have noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $26 billion. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. One-way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis; and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $95 billion and $94 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $24 billion and $23 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Following the change in presentation of our segment operating results in the first quarter of 2021, we reassessed the reporting units related to goodwill in our NBCUniversal segments and concluded that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments. See Note 2 for additional information. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Exhibits 43 SIGNATURES 44 Explanatory Note Beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we are voluntarily complying with new disclosure rules for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed debt securities issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in March 2020, as permitted by the transition guidance contained in the SEC’s final rule release “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant’s Securities.” As a result, this report includes disclosures related to our consolidated subsidiaries that guarantee or have issued guaranteed debt securities registered with the SEC that are included within our guarantee structure (refer to Guarantee Structure within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). As a result of these rules, NBCUniversal Media, LLC is no longer required to prepare stand-alone periodic reports under SEC rules, and our periodic reports are no longer prepared as a combined report being filed separately by Comcast Corporation and NBCUniversal Media, LLC. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal, LLC as “NBCUniversal Holdings;” NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. as “NBCUniversal Enterprise;” NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “NBCUniversal;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should carefully review the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and particularly consider any risk factors set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called “forward-looking statements” by words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks outlined below and in other reports we file with the SEC. Actual events or our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ and Sky’s video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • we rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Business and Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in six reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Cable Communications is a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Cable Networks consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations; and various digital properties. Broadcast Television consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Filmed Entertainment consists primarily of the operations of Universal Pictures, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide; our films are also produced under the Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, and an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, such as Peacock, our new direct-to-consumer streaming service that primarily features NBCUniversal content. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 15,000 $ 6,411 $ 1,952 $ 1,770 $ 296 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 2,736 870 191 6 3 Broadcast Television 2,414 436 38 13 7 Filmed Entertainment 1,280 300 26 2 4 Theme Parks 311 ( 203 ) 208 306 11 Headquarters and Other (a) 32 ( 121 ) 113 30 28 Eliminations (b) ( 49 ) ( 1 ) — — — NBCUniversal 6,724 1,281 576 357 53 Sky 4,793 515 750 237 176 Corporate and Other (c) 84 ( 496 ) 42 23 27 Eliminations (b) ( 1,069 ) ( 128 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 25,532 $ 7,583 $ 3,320 $ 2,387 $ 552 Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 14,584 $ 5,801 $ 1,967 $ 1,814 $ 336 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 2,771 955 184 9 4 Broadcast Television 2,230 338 36 36 3 Filmed Entertainment 1,706 195 21 5 5 Theme Parks 1,631 731 182 400 8 Headquarters and Other (a) 21 ( 130 ) 114 55 43 Eliminations (b) ( 64 ) 2 — — — NBCUniversal 8,295 2,091 537 505 63 Sky 4,554 899 644 104 188 Corporate and Other (c) 42 ( 237 ) 32 88 21 Eliminations (b) ( 648 ) ( 1 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 26,827 $ 8,553 $ 3,180 $ 2,511 $ 608 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 44,346 $ 18,663 $ 5,835 $ 4,491 $ 978 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 8,110 3,361 576 16 11 Broadcast Television 7,462 1,578 120 58 12 Filmed Entertainment 3,844 634 71 9 14 Theme Parks 1,267 ( 526 ) 590 897 42 Headquarters and Other (a) 79 ( 381 ) 358 129 107 Eliminations (b) ( 180 ) — — — — NBCUniversal 20,582 4,666 1,715 1,109 186 Sky 13,389 1,815 2,188 649 512 Corporate and Other (c) 250 ( 1,254 ) 110 95 95 Eliminations (b) ( 2,711 ) ( 250 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 75,856 $ 23,640 $ 9,848 $ 6,344 $ 1,771 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 43,314 $ 17,383 $ 6,038 $ 4,771 $ 962 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 8,586 3,418 549 21 10 Broadcast Television 7,099 1,259 115 86 9 Filmed Entertainment 4,931 742 60 13 16 Theme Parks 4,371 1,819 514 1,172 44 Headquarters and Other (a) 60 ( 486 ) 341 139 120 Eliminations (b) ( 233 ) — — — — NBCUniversal 24,814 6,752 1,579 1,431 199 Sky 14,179 2,334 2,058 540 491 Corporate and Other (c) 206 ( 637 ) 101 124 34 Eliminations (b) ( 1,969 ) ( 10 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 80,544 $ 25,822 $ 9,776 $ 6,866 $ 1,686 (a) NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. (b) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue at Cable Networks for the sale of programming to Cable Communications; content licensing revenue in our NBCUniversal segments (Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Cable Networks) for the license of owned content to Peacock and Sky, and for licenses of owned content to other NBCUniversal segments; advertising revenue at Cable Communications, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television; and distribution revenue at Broadcast Television for fees received under retransmission consent agreements from Cable Communications. For segment reporting purposes, we account for intercompany content licenses as follows: • Revenue for licenses of content from NBCUniversal segments to Peacock and Sky are generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses at Peacock and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations as the profits on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. • Revenue for licenses of content between NBCUniversal segments is recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the programming rights asset for the licensed content as the content is used over the license period. (c) Corporate and Other activities include costs associated with overhead and personnel, revenue and expenses associated with our other business interests, including Peacock. (d) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.

Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet The following tables summarize our accounts receivable and other balances that are not separately presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheet that relate to the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash, as well as deferred costs associated with our contracts with customers.

We adopted new accounting guidance related to film and television costs in the first quarter of 2020 (see Note 8), and accordingly amounts presented below for periods in 2020 and the policy discussion reflect the updated accounting guidance, and amounts presented for 2019 reflect the accounting guidance in effect at that time. Under the new accounting guidance, we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. Amortization of Film and Television Costs (in millions) Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Owned film and television costs $ 1,556 $ 4,883 Programming rights $ 3,526 $ 7,774 10 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Capitalized Film and Television Costs September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in millions) Film and Television Costs Film Costs Television Costs Total Owned film and television costs: Released, less amortization $ 3,578 $ 1,551 $ 2,810 $ 4,361 Completed, not released 147 187 — 187 In production and in development 2,608 1,314 1,162 2,476 6,333 3,052 3,972 7,024 Programming rights, less amortization 6,408 5,786 12,741 12,810 Less: Current portion of programming rights — 3,877 Film and television costs $ 12,741 $ 8,933 The table below summarizes estimated future amortization expense for the capitalized film and television costs recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020. (in millions) Owned Film and Television Costs Programming Rights Completed, not released: Remaining three months of 2020 $ 20 Released and programming rights: Remaining three months of 2020 $ 440 $ 1,739 2021 $ 901 $ 2,846 2022 $ 463 $ 760 Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Costs We capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residual payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution. We may enter into cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. Cofinancing arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor’s interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor’s interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method. We capitalize the costs of programming rights for content that we license but do not own when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of programming licenses are known. Programming rights are amortized as the associated programs are broadcast. Owned film and television costs and programming rights are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of film and television costs and accrued costs associated with participation and residual payments in programming and production costs. When an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned film and television content or programming rights is less than the unamortized costs in the 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned film and television costs are assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned film and television costs are evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Programming rights that are not part of a film group are generally assessed in packages, channels, or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Programming rights licensed by Cable Networks are primarily tested on a channel basis for impairment, whereas programming rights licensed by Broadcast Television are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned film and television costs or programming rights are generally based on level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented. Sports Programming Rights We recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports programming rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the programming delivered, we recognize an asset in programming rights. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in programming rights.

Our potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our stock options and our restricted share units (“RSUs”). Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in which the combination of the option exercise price and the associated unrecognized compensation expense is greater than the average market price of our common stock. The amount of potential common shares related to our share-based compensation plans that were excluded from diluted EPS because their effect would 12 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation have been antidilutive was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 or 2019. Note 6: Long-Term Debt As of September 30, 2020, our debt had a carrying value of $ 104.4 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 124.2 billion. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Note 7: Significant Transactions Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. As of September 30, 2020, Universal Beijing Resort had $ 2.1 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of September 30, 2020, our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loan, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 4.5 billion and $ 3.0 billion, respectively. Note 8: Recent Accounting Pronouncements Film and Television Costs In March 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligned the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The guidance also updated certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs, and when content is predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content the guidance requires impairment testing for capitalized film and television costs to be performed at a film group level and amortization to be based on usage. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted. Following the adoption, we now present all film and television costs, including acquired programming rights previously classified as current, as noncurrent in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 4 for further information. Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables and loans. The updated guidance requires the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of expected losses, replacing the incurred loss model in the prior guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis, recording $ 124 million, net of tax, as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for any periods presented. 13 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 9: Investments Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ ( 266 ) $ ( 355 ) $ ( 634 ) $ ( 295 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 118 174 65 582 Other income (loss), net 62 71 187 224 Investment and other income (loss), net $ ( 86 ) $ ( 110 ) $ ( 382 ) $ 511 (in millions) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Equity method $ 5,097 $ 5,347 Marketable equity securities 141 353 Nonmarketable equity securities 1,833 1,896 Other investments 138 1,796 Total investments 7,209 9,392 Less: Current investments 78 1,709 Less: Investment securing collateralized obligation 429 694 Noncurrent investments $ 6,702 $ 6,989 Equity Method Atairos Atairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized losses of $ 107 million and $ 242 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized a loss of $ 262 million and income of $ 6 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $ 184 million and $ 475 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our investment in Atairos was $ 3.3 billion and $ 3.2 billion, respectively. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recognized losses of $ 104 million and $ 265 million, respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, we recognized losses of $ 101 million and $ 351 million, respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net and in the first quarter of 2019, we recognized a previously deferred dilution gain of $ 159 million in other income (loss), net. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, we made cash capital contributions totaling $ 903 million to Hulu, inclusive of the funding to acquire our proportionate share of AT&T’s previously held 10 % interest. There were no cash capital contributions made during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our investment was $ 429 million and $ 694 million, respectively. In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of September 30, 2020, both the carrying value and fair value of our collateralized obligation was $ 5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. Marketable Equity Securities Peloton Following Peloton’s initial public offering in September 2019, we recognized unrealized gains of $ 150 million in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net and presented our investment in Peloton in marketable equity securities, which was previously presented in nonmarketable equity securities. In the second quarter of 2020, we sold our investment in Peloton 14 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation and recognized gains of $ 67 million in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. As of December 31, 2019, our investment in Peloton was $ 294 million. Snap In the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold our investment in Snap.

Contingencies We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation. 16 Table of Contents ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Cable Communications Segment Cable Communications is a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. As of September 30, 2020, our cable systems had 32.7 million total customer relationships, including 30.3 million residential and 2.4 million business customer relationships, and passed more than 59 million homes and businesses. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services, which are marketed individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. NBCUniversal Segments NBCUniversal is one of the world’s leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks worldwide . Cable Networks Cable Networks consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations; and various digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers; from the sale of advertising on our cable networks and digital properties; from the licensing of our owned programming, including programming from our cable television studio production operations, to cable and broadcast networks and subscription video on demand services; and from the sale of our owned content on standard-definition DVDs and Blu-ray discs (together, “DVDs”) and through digital distribution services such as iTunes. Broadcast Television Broadcast Television consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of advertising on our networks and digital properties, from the licensing of programming, including to cable and broadcast networks as well as to subscription video on demand services; from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations; and from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Filmed Entertainment Filmed Entertainment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Revenue is generated primarily from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, from the licensing of produced and acquired films through various distribution platforms, and from the sale of produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Filmed Entertainment also generates revenue from Fandango, a movie ticketing and entertainment business, consumer products, the production and licensing of live stage plays, and the distribution of filmed entertainment produced by third parties. Theme Parks Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, and an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Revenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our Universal theme parks. 17 Table of Contents Sky Segment Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. As of September 30, 2020, Sky had 23.7 million retail customer relationships. Corporate and Other Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, such as Peacock, which was made available to Comcast customers in April 2020 and launched nationally in July 2020. Impacts of COVID-19 The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe continue to impact our businesses in a number of ways. Our Cable Communications results of operations were strong in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, despite having been affected by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions and by the costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as people continued to work and learn remotely from home. COVID-19 had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations during the second and third quarters of 2020 primarily due to the temporary closure of our theme parks and the postponement and cancellation of many sporting events. We continue to implement and evaluate cost initiatives across our businesses that have impacted and will continue to impact our results of operations; certain costs incurred by our businesses in response to COVID-19, including severance and restructuring charges, are presented in Corporate and Other. We expect the impacts of COVID-19 will continue to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term. Cable Communications • Our distribution network to date has performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by increased video streaming, gaming and videoconferencing as more customers work and learn remotely from home. • We incurred costs in 2020 associated with compensating personnel in roles affected by COVID-19, primarily during the first half of the year. These costs included additional compensation for frontline personnel who worked to keep our customers connected to our services and compensation for certain personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations. • Beginning in March 2020 and continuing through the end of December 2020, new qualifying customers for Internet Essentials, our low-income internet adoption program, will receive 60 days of free internet services. We also implemented programs, primarily during the second quarter of 2020, under which we elected to waive certain fees and to not disconnect internet, voice or wireless services for customers for nonpayment, and we are now providing customers a variety of flexible and extended payment options. As a result of these programs, our customer metrics for 2020 do not include customers in the free Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment. The number of customers excluded from our customer metrics was highest as of June 30, 2020 and these customers were excluded from second quarter net additions. The number of such customers decreased in the third quarter as some of these customers began paying for service, resulting in customer net additions, or disconnected and no longer receive service. We expect the number of excluded customers to continue to decrease in the fourth quarter. • Professional sports leagues have generally resumed, some with a reduced schedule for the remainder of the interrupted seasons. Certain of our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks include contractual adjustment provisions if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur. In the second and third quarters of 2020, our programming expenses were reduced as a result of these provisions, and our revenue was negatively impacted in similar amounts as a result of adjustments that we have begun passing through to our customers in the fourth quarter of 2020. • The deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 have resulted in reduced demand for certain of our residential and business services and reduced spending from advertisers, which have had, and likely will continue to have, negative impacts on our revenue over the near to medium term. In addition, we believe there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increases in our bad debt expense compared to the prior year periods. 18 Table of Contents NBCUniversal • The temporary closure of all of our theme parks had the most significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 on a consolidated basis. Our parks in Orlando and Japan reopened with limited capacity in June 2020, while our park in Hollywood remains closed. We expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term, and we cannot predict when the Hollywood park will reopen, if any reopened parks will remain open or the level of attendance at any reopened parks. In addition, although we currently expect that Universal Beijing Resort will open in 2021, we have delayed certain construction projects, including the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando. • The deterioration of economic conditions caused by COVID-19 resulted in significant reductions in advertising spend by our customers in the Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments in the second and third quarters of 2020, and we expect this trend to continue over the near to medium term. These conditions have also resulted, and may continue to result, in an acceleration of subscriber losses at our networks. • We incurred costs in 2020 associated with compensating personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations, primarily during the first half of the year, including at our theme parks and at our production studios. • The postponement and cancellation of many sporting events and professional sports seasons impacted our first and second quarter 2020 results of operations, since both advertising revenues and costs associated with broadcasting these programs were not recognized. Professional sports leagues have generally resumed in the third quarter of 2020, some with reduced numbers of events for the remainder of the interrupted seasons. Certain of our sports programming rights agreements and distribution agreements with multichannel video providers include contractual provisions if a minimum number of events does not occur. Our distribution revenue in the second and third quarters of 2020 was negatively impacted as a result of credits accrued relating to these provisions; and the programming costs that we recognize as the remaining events occur, which were primarily in the third quarter of 2020, will also be impacted. When, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021 will impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition. In addition, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics have been postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, which will result in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs. • The creation and availability of our film and television programming in the United States and globally have been disrupted, including from the suspension of studio production operations in the first half of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, our studio production operations resumed at a limited capacity. Additionally, with the temporary closure of many movie theaters worldwide, we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally. Delays in theatrical releases will affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows. We expect results of operations in our Filmed Entertainment segment to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19. Sky • Many sporting events and professional sports seasons were postponed beginning in the second half of the first quarter of 2020, with certain sports, including European soccer, resuming in May and June 2020, which resulted in significant impacts on Sky’s results of operations in the first, second and third quarters of 2020. Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted as a result of lower sports subscription revenue and we expect continued negative impacts as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 on the reopening plans and the extent of reopening of our commercial customers. Additionally, significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs were not recognized as a result of the sporting events not occurring in the first quarter and for most of the second quarter. These costs were generally recognized in the third quarter of 2020; and although sporting events have resumed, COVID-19 continues to result in uncertainty in the ultimate timing of when, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur for the remainder of 2020; their broadcast is expected to impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition. • We temporarily suspended certain sales channels due to COVID-19, which negatively impacted net customer additions and revenue in the first and second quarters of 2020. Our sales channels generally resumed operations in June. • COVID-19 has resulted in the deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe, intensifying what was an already deteriorating economic and advertising environment. These conditions negatively impacted revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and we expect will continue to reduce advertising spend and consumer demand for our services for the remainder of 2020. In addition, there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increases in our bad debt expense. 19 Table of Contents Global financial markets have been volatile and domestic and global economic conditions continue to show signs of material weakness. At this point, it is impossible to predict the extent and duration of these and any other impacts of COVID-19 to our businesses, or the degree to which demand for our products and services, or supply of key inputs to those products and services, will be affected. This uncertainty makes it challenging for management to estimate with precision the future performance of our businesses. As of September 30, 2020, we evaluated whether the facts and circumstances and available information resulted in the need for an impairment assessment for any of our long-lived assets and concluded no assessment was required. Refer to the Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates section for discussion of our impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights. We will continue to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 to our businesses, including the impacts of overall economic conditions, which could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the future. Our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were impacted by significant losses and gains as a result of the volatility in the market values for publicly traded equity securities underlying our investments. Liquidity Although negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19, we expect that our businesses will continue to generate significant cash flow from operating activities and we believe that these cash flows, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain future external financing, will be sufficient for us to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements. However, we expect the timing of certain priorities to be impacted, such as the pace of our debt reduction efforts and return to share repurchases, and the delay of certain capital projects. Competition All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been viewed by consumers. This increase has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines at our programming channels. For additional information on the competition our businesses face, see our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and refer to Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the “Competition” discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled “Our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.” Seasonality and Cyclicality Each of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications’ results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year. Revenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains) are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, which affect Cable Networks and Broadcast Television, and the Super Bowl, which affects Broadcast Television. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees. Revenue in Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively. Revenue in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. 20 Table of Contents Revenue at Sky has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup TM . Revenue in Filmed Entertainment fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. Content licensing revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees. Revenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Theme Parks generally experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the Christmas holiday season. Sky’s results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving direct-to-home (“DTH”) and over the top (“OTT”) video services, including the start of the new soccer seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the second half of each year due to higher marketing expenses. Exclusive sports rights play a key role within Sky’s wider content strategy. In Europe, broadcasting rights for major sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality for Sky, although the staggered timing of major sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market. Certain of Sky’s significant sports rights agreements require payments at the start of each season, resulting in increases in sports rights payments in the third and fourth quarter of each year. 21 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 % 2020 2019 % Revenue $ 25,532 $ 26,827 (4.8) % $ 75,856 $ 80,544 (5.8) % Costs and Expenses: Programming and production 8,565 8,316 3.0 23,683 25,140 (5.8) Other operating and administrative 8,059 8,090 (0.4) 23,959 24,076 (0.5) Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,512 1,901 (20.5) 4,791 5,674 (15.6) Depreciation 2,122 2,124 (0.1) 6,328 6,561 (3.6) Amortization 1,198 1,056 13.4 3,520 3,215 9.5 Operating income 4,076 5,340 (23.7) 13,575 15,878 (14.5) Interest expense (1,220) (1,167) 4.5 (3,544) (3,454) 2.6 Investment and other income (loss), net (86) (110) (21.9) (382) 511 (174.6) Income before income taxes 2,770 4,063 (31.8) 9,649 12,935 (25.4) Income tax expense (739) (775) (4.6) (2,385) (2,812) (15.2) Net income 2,031 3,288 (38.2) 7,264 10,123 (28.2) Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock 12 71 (83.6) 110 228 (51.9) Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 2,019 $ 3,217 (37.2) % $ 7,154 $ 9,895 (27.7) % Basic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.44 $ 0.71 (38.0) % $ 1.57 $ 2.18 (28.0) % Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.44 $ 0.70 (37.1) % $ 1.55 $ 2.15 (27.9) % Adjusted EBITDA (a) $ 7,583 $ 8,553 (11.3) % $ 23,640 $ 25,822 (8.5) % All percentages are calculated based on actual amounts.

Consolidated Revenue Theme Parks, Filmed Entertainment and Cable Networks drove decreases in consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which were partially offset by increases in revenue in Cable Communications, Sky and Broadcast Television. Theme Parks, Filmed Entertainment, Sky and Cable Networks drove decreases in consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which were partially offset by increases in revenue in Cable Communications and Broadcast Television. Revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Costs and Expenses Filmed Entertainment, Theme Parks and Cable Communications drove decreases in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which were partially offset by increases in operating costs and expenses in Sky, Broadcast Television and Cable Networks. Filmed Entertainment, Theme Parks, Cable Networks, Sky and Cable Communications drove decreases in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which were partially offset by increases in operating costs and expenses in Broadcast Television. 22 Table of Contents Operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, businesses development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 % 2020 2019 % Cable Communications $ 1,952 $ 1,967 (0.7) % $ 5,835 $ 6,038 (3.4) % NBCUniversal 576 537 7.3 1,715 1,579 8.6 Sky 750 644 16.5 2,188 2,058 6.3 Corporate and Other 42 32 26.7 110 101 6.9 Comcast Consolidated $ 3,320 $ 3,180 4.4 % $ 9,848 $ 9,776 0.7 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the amortization of certain trade names beginning in the first quarter of 2020, which were previously accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets (see Note 10), partially offset by a decrease in depreciation at Cable Communications related to a reduction in capital expenditures on customer premise equipment. During the first quarter of 2019, we recorded adjustments to the purchase price allocation of Sky, primarily related to intangible assets and property and equipment. This change resulted in an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that increased depreciation and amortization expense by $53 million. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $574 million and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $486 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to a $220 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2020 related to the early redemption of senior notes due 2022 and 2023, partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates in the current year period. Interest expense increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to $360 million of charges recorded in the first and third quarters of 2020 related to the early redemption of senior notes due 2021 to 2023, partially offset by decreases in our debt outstanding.

The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments. The equity in net income (losses) of Atairos and Hulu for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the table below.

See Note 9. Other Income (Loss), Net The decrease in other income (loss), net for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily relates to higher foreign exchange remeasurement gains in 2020, more than offset by a gain of $60 million recorded in the prior year period related to the dilution of our Hulu ownership. The decrease in other income (loss), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily relates to gains of $219 million recorded in the first and third quarters of 2019 related to the dilution of our Hulu ownership, partially offset by $90 million of losses due to equity method investment impairments recorded in the second and third quarters of 2019 and higher foreign exchange remeasurement gains in 2020. See Note 9. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The decrease in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 was primarily due to lower income before income taxes in 2020, partially offset by the impact of tax law changes in the third quarter of 2020 and a benefit from state tax adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2019. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes.

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of September 30, 2020 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 299,000 and 9,000, respectively. Wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics for 2020 do not include customers in the free Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continued to receive service following nonpayment (refer to “Impacts of COVID-19” for further discussion). Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 154.27 $ 156.72 $ 153.42 $ 156.29 Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 65.94 $ 62.34 $ 64.57 $ 62.72 Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin and we also use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe these metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services. 26 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment – Revenue High-Speed Internet Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to increases in the number of residential high-speed internet customers and increases in average rates. Average rates in the second and third quarters of 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments and waived fees due to COVID-19. Refer to video description for further information. Video Revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to declines in the number of residential video customers, partially offset by increases in average rates. Average rates in the second and third quarters of 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events. For customers receiving bundled services, the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle. We have experienced, and expect that we will continue to experience, declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures, and we expect that our video revenue will continue to decline as a result of the economic and competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs, such as promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments. Voice Revenue decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to decreases in average rates and the number of residential voice customers. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to increases in the number of customer lines. Business Services Revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to increases in average rates and increases in the number of customers receiving our services. The rates of growth in the second and third quarters of 2020 were reduced due to the negative impacts of COVID-19 on small businesses. Advertising Revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to an increase in political advertising, partially offset by reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19. Revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in political advertising. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, 5% of our advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, 8% and 6%, respectively, of our advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Other Revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to certain waived billing and collection fees due to COVID-19 and a decrease in security and automation services. Revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to certain waived billing and collection fees due to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to adjustments recorded for provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events as a result of COVID-19. Excluding these adjustments, programming expenses increased due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming fees, partially offset by declines in the number of video customers. We anticipate that our programming expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 will be impacted by higher rate increases compared to those experienced in 2019 due to the timing of contract renewals in 2020, partially offset by an expected decline in the number of residential video customers. 27 Table of Contents Technical and product support expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to lower personnel costs and cost savings initiatives as well as a reduction in activity in certain aspects of our business related to COVID-19, partially offset by increased costs associated with our wireless phone service. Technical and product support expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service and increased costs related to COVID-19, including additional compensation costs for certain personnel, partially offset by cost savings initiatives and a reduction in activity in certain aspects of our business. Customer service expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of cost savings initiatives and reduced call volumes. Customer service expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by increases in costs as a result of additional Xfinity stores. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to decreases in spending. Franchise and other regulatory fees increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to increases in the related rates of these fees. Other operating costs and expenses increased slightly for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Other operating costs and expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increases in bad debt expense as a result of COVID-19 and personnel-related costs, partially offset by lower third-party advertising costs. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services, and on reducing losses related to our wireless phone service and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was 42.7% and 42.1%, respectively. While the accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, they resulted in increases to operating margins. Our operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was 39.8% and 40.1%, respectively. The most significant operating costs and expenses are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which were flat for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, and decreased 1.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Losses from our wireless phone service were $50 million and $146 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, compared to losses of $94 million and $285 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively.

Distribution revenue decreased primarily due to credits accrued at some of our regional sports networks resulting from the reduced number of games played by professional sports leagues due to COVID-19. Certain of our distribution agreements with multichannel video providers require contractual adjustments if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur. Excluding these credits, distribution revenue decreased due to increased declines in the number of subscribers at our cable networks, partially offset by increases in the contractual rates charged under distribution agreements. Advertising revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to continued audience ratings declines at our networks, partially offset by spending from advertisers on our sports networks as a result of professional sports leagues resuming postponed seasons due to COVID-19. Advertising revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to continued audience ratings declines at our networks and reduced spending from advertisers as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by higher prices for advertising units sold. Content licensing and other revenue increased primarily due to the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements, which included transactions with Peacock beginning in the second quarter of 2020. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, 15% and 14%, respectively, of our Cable Networks segment revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, 16% and 15%, respectively, of our Cable Networks segment revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Cable Networks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increases in programming and production costs, which were offset by decreases in advertising, marketing and promotion costs and other operating and administrative costs. The increase in programming and production costs was primarily due to an increase in sports programming costs as professional sports leagues resumed seasons following postponements as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by decreases in other programming costs at our networks and studio production costs. The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion costs was due to lower spending on marketing related to our cable networks. The decrease in other operating and administrative costs was primarily due to lower employee-related and other overhead costs as a result of cost savings initiatives. Operating costs and expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to decreases in programming and production costs and advertising, marketing and promotion costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was primarily due to decreases in sports programming costs recognized resulting from the reduced number of events as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by increases in studio production costs. The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion costs was due to lower spending on marketing related to our cable networks. The decrease in other operating and administrative costs was primarily due to lower employee-related and other overhead costs as a result of cost savings initiatives.

The increases in content licensing revenue were primarily due to the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements, which included transactions with Peacock beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The increases in distribution and other revenue were primarily due to increases in fees recognized under our retransmission consent agreements. Advertising revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to continued declines in audience ratings. The decrease in advertising revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to continued declines in audience ratings and reduced spending from advertisers as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by higher prices for advertising units sold. Broadcast Television Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to increases in programming and production costs, partially offset by decreases in advertising, marketing and promotion costs and other operating and administrative costs. The increases in programming and production costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 were primarily due to amortization associated with content licensing sales, partially offset by the impact of the updated accounting guidance, which removed certain limitations on the amounts capitalized for episodic television series and had a favorable impact on programming and production expense in the current year (see Note 8). The increase in programming and production costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was also partially offset by decreases in sports programming costs recognized due to the reduced number of events as a result of COVID-19. The decreases in advertising, marketing and promotion costs were primarily due to reduced spending on marketing related to our programming. The decreases in other operating and administrative costs were due to decreased overhead costs as part of cost savings initiatives and lower employee-related costs.

The decrease in theatrical revenue was primarily due to theater closures as a result of COVID-19 . The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to decreases in revenue from our movie ticketing and entertainment business and live stage plays, which were impacted by theater and entertainment venue closures as a result of COVID-19. The increase in content licensing revenue was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements, increased sales of titles made available on demand, including certain 2020 releases after theater closures due to COVID-19, and transactions with Peacock beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in home entertainment revenue was primarily due to higher sales of 2020 releases, including Trolls World Tour. Filmed Entertainment revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to decreases in theatrical revenue and other revenue, partially offset by an increase in content licensing revenue. The decreases in theatrical and other revenue were primarily due to theater and entertainment venue closures as a result of COVID-19. The increase in content licensing revenue was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements, increased sales of titles made available on demand, including certain 2020 releases after theater closures due to COVID-19, and transactions with Peacock beginning in the second quarter of 2020. Filmed Entertainment Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to decreases in advertising, marketing and promotion costs, programming and production costs, and other operating and administrative costs. The decreases in advertising, marketing and promotion costs were due to lower spending on current period releases as a result of COVID-19. The decreases in programming and production costs were primarily due to higher amortization of film production costs in the prior year period. The decreases in other operating and administrative costs were due to lower costs associated with our movie ticketing and entertainment business and live stage plays, which were impacted by theater and entertainment venue closures as a result of COVID-19, and overall efforts of the business to reduce costs.

Our theme parks in Orlando and Japan reopened with limited capacity in June, while our park in Hollywood remains closed. Theme Parks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Theme Parks operating costs and expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to decreases in costs related to park operations due to the park closures and lower marketing-related costs, partially offset by pre-opening costs associated with Universal Beijing Resort.

Commercial retail customers include hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants with an active subscription for the purpose of providing Sky services to customers. Sky reports commercial customers based on the number of commercial agreements per venue in the U.K., and generally based on a residential equivalent unit using the multiple of residential customer revenue in Italy and the number of active venues (bars and restaurants) or rooms (hotels and clinics) in Germany.

Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 36 for additional information, including our definition and our use of constant currency, and for a reconciliation of Sky’s constant currency growth rates. Average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by Sky’s customers. Each of Sky’s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe average monthly direct-to-consumer revenue per customer relationship is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to-consumer service offerings. Sky Segment – Revenue Direct-to-Consumer Revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to decreases in customer relationships, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, decreases in average revenue per customer relationship also contributed to the decrease. Content Revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to higher revenue from sports programming wholesaling arrangements as European soccer leagues resumed sporting events that were previously postponed due to COVID-19. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in revenue from the distribution of Sky’s sports programming on third-party platforms due to postponed sporting events as a result of COVID-19. Advertising Revenue increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to overall market weakness, partially offset by additional sporting events in the current quarter that were previously postponed. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to overall market weakness, which has worsened due to COVID-19, and the impact of changes in legislation related to gambling advertisements in the U.K. and Italy that occurred in the third quarter of 2019. Sky Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the recognition of sports programming costs due to rescheduled sporting events that were previously postponed due to COVID-19, partially offset by the impact of the delayed starts of new seasons. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the impact of the delayed starts of the new European soccer seasons. 34 Table of Contents Direct network costs increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct network costs increased primarily due to increases in costs associated with Sky’s high-speed internet and wireless phone services as a result of increases in the number of customers receiving these services. Other expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses increased primarily due to higher marketing costs and a favorable settlement in the prior year periods. The increase in other expenses for the nine months ended September, 30, 2020 was partially offset by lower costs relating to advertising sales resulting from the impact of COVID-19.

Corporate and Other – Revenue Revenue primarily relates to Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and, beginning in the second quarter of 2020, revenues at Peacock. Corporate and Other – Operating Costs and Expenses Expenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the costs of other business initiatives, such as Peacock, and operating costs and expenses associated with Comcast Spectacor. Expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to costs associated with Peacock, certain costs incurred in response to COVID-19, including severance and restructuring charges related to our NBCUniversal segments, and a potential legal settlement, which were partially offset by a reduction in costs related to the Sky transaction. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, Peacock costs include amortization of film and television costs and we expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing for the new platform. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA excludes a potential legal settlement and Sky transaction-related costs. 35 Table of Contents Eliminations Three Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 $ % Revenue $ (1,069) $ (648) $ 421 64.9 % Operating costs and expenses (941) (647) 294 45.2 Adjusted EBITDA $ (128) $ (1) $ 127 NM Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 $ % Revenue $ (2,711) $ (1,969) $ 742 37.6 % Operating costs and expenses (2,461) (1,959) 502 25.5 Adjusted EBITDA $ (250) $ (10) $ 240 NM Percentage changes that are considered not meaningful are denoted with NM.

Refer to Note 2 for further description of transactions between our segments. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income (loss), net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP. 36 Table of Contents Reconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 2,019 $ 3,217 $ 7,154 $ 9,895 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock 12 71 110 228 Income tax expense 739 775 2,385 2,812 Investment and other (income) loss, net 86 110 382 (511) Interest expense 1,220 1,167 3,544 3,454 Depreciation 2,122 2,124 6,328 6,561 Amortization 1,198 1,056 3,520 3,215 Adjustment for potential legal settlement 177 — 177 — Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs 10 33 40 168 Adjusted EBITDA $ 7,583 $ 8,553 $ 23,640 $ 25,822 Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. Refer to “Impacts of COVID-19” for additional discussion. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of September 30, 2020, amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion.

The decrease in payments of income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to lower taxable income from operations in 2020, partially offset by the taxable gain associated with the AirTouch redemption which approximated the proceeds received. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, purchases of investments and cash paid for intangible assets. Capital expenditures decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to decreases in spending by our Cable Communications and Theme Parks segments. We anticipate further declines in spending across our segments as a result of COVID-19, even as we continue to invest in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our Cable Communications segment. Proceeds from sales of businesses and investments increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to $1.7 billion of proceeds received from the sale of our investment in AirTouch in the second quarter of 2020. See Note 9. On September 2, 2020, the FCC announced the results of its spectrum auction. In the auction, we were awarded the rights to $459 million of spectrum, the majority of which will be paid in the fourth quarter of 2020. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and the related early redemption payments presented in other financing activities, dividend payments and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares in the second quarter of 2020 presented in other financing activities (see Note 9), which were partially offset by proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the settlement of cross currency swaps related to our debt presented in other financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and dividend payments, partially offset by proceeds from a collateralized obligation. 38 Table of Contents In the first quarter of 2020, we issued $4.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes maturing between 2025 and 2040, $3.2 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed rate Euro senior notes maturing between 2027 and 2040 and $1.8 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed rate Sterling senior notes maturing between 2029 and 2036. In the second quarter of 2020, we issued $4.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes maturing between 2031 and 2051. In August 2020, we issued $4.5 billion of fixed rate senior notes maturing between 2031 and 2062. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we made debt repayments totaling $16.8 billion, including the early redemption and purchase of $14.9 billion of senior notes maturing between 2020 and 2047. As of September 30, 2020, we had no commercial paper outstanding and there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends Effective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $12 billion, which does not have an expiration date. Under the authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We have paused our share repurchase program in order to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky, and no common shares were repurchased under the authorization for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. We paid $429 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2020, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.92 per share on an annualized basis. In July 2020, our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.23 per share paid in October 2020. We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. On July 22, 2020, we paid dividends of $1.1 billion. Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. 39 Table of Contents Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Debt subject to cross-guarantees Comcast $ 86.5 $ 80.4 NBCUniversal (a) 2.8 5.8 Comcast Cable (a) 2.1 2.1 91.4 88.3 Debt subject to one-way guarantees Sky 8.7 9.2 Other (a) 2.8 4.1 11.5 13.3 Debt not guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 2.1 1.3 Other 1.1 1.0 3.2 2.3 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (1.7) (1.7) Total debt $ 104.4 $ 102.2 (a) NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 7 for additional information. Cross-guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $124 billion and $122 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $23 billion and $21 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. 40 Table of Contents One-way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $185 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis; and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $93 billion and $92 billion, respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $21 billion and $18 billion, respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We performed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights as of July 1, 2020 and no impairment was required. Our impairment testing consisted of qualitative assessments for our cable franchise rights and goodwill in our Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments, and a quantitative assessment for goodwill in our Sky segment. The goodwill in our Sky segment resulted from our acquisition of Sky in the fourth quarter of 2018. Given this was a recent transaction, the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the Sky reporting unit.

Exhibits 41 SIGNATURES 42 Explanatory Note Beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, we are voluntarily complying with new disclosure rules for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed debt securities issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in March 2020, as permitted by the transition guidance contained in the SEC’s final rule release “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant’s Securities.” As a result, this report includes disclosures related to our consolidated subsidiaries that guarantee or have issued guaranteed debt securities registered with the SEC that are included within our guarantee structure (refer to Guarantee Structure within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). As a result of these rules, NBCUniversal Media, LLC is no longer required to prepare stand-alone periodic reports under SEC rules, and our periodic reports are no longer prepared as a combined report being filed separately by Comcast Corporation and NBCUniversal Media, LLC. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal, LLC as “NBCUniversal Holdings;” NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. as “NBCUniversal Enterprise;” NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “NBCUniversal;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 . This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should carefully review the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and particularly consider any risk factors set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called “forward-looking statements” by words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks outlined below and in other reports we file with the SEC. Actual events or our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ and Sky’s video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • we rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL

Corporation NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Business and Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in six reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Cable Communications is a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Cable Networks consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations; and various digital properties. Broadcast Television consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Filmed Entertainment consists primarily of the operations of Universal Pictures, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide; our films are also produced under the Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, and an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, such as Peacock, our new direct-to-consumer streaming service that primarily features NBCUniversal content. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 14,428 $ 6,176 $ 1,937 $ 1,452 $ 326 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 2,515 1,243 190 5 5 Broadcast Television 2,364 641 39 20 2 Filmed Entertainment 1,194 228 23 3 5 Theme Parks 87 ( 399 ) 193 295 16 Headquarters and Other (a) 24 ( 73 ) 129 52 38 Eliminations (b) ( 60 ) ( 2 ) — — — NBCUniversal 6,124 1,638 574 375 66 Sky 4,079 749 720 215 170 Corporate and Other (c) 46 ( 506 ) 33 34 39 Eliminations (b) ( 962 ) ( 130 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 23,715 $ 7,927 $ 3,264 $ 2,076 $ 601 Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 14,450 $ 5,854 $ 2,036 $ 1,594 $ 303 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 2,947 1,201 183 6 4 Broadcast Television 2,402 534 40 37 3 Filmed Entertainment 1,457 183 20 4 6 Theme Parks 1,464 590 170 378 17 Headquarters and Other (a) 22 ( 182 ) 114 48 35 Eliminations (b) ( 86 ) ( 2 ) — — — NBCUniversal 8,206 2,324 527 473 65 Sky 4,828 772 673 177 152 Corporate and Other (c) 56 ( 213 ) 40 19 11 Eliminations (b) ( 682 ) ( 21 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 26,858 $ 8,716 $ 3,276 $ 2,263 $ 531 Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 29,346 $ 12,252 $ 3,883 $ 2,721 $ 682 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 5,374 2,491 385 10 8 Broadcast Television 5,048 1,142 82 45 5 Filmed Entertainment 2,564 334 45 7 10 Theme Parks 956 ( 323 ) 382 591 31 Headquarters and Other (a) 47 ( 260 ) 245 99 79 Eliminations (b) ( 131 ) 1 — — — NBCUniversal 13,858 3,385 1,139 752 133 Sky 8,596 1,300 1,438 412 336 Corporate and Other (c) 166 ( 758 ) 68 72 68 Eliminations (b) ( 1,642 ) ( 122 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 50,324 $ 16,057 $ 6,528 $ 3,957 $ 1,219 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 28,730 $ 11,582 $ 4,071 $ 2,957 $ 626 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 5,815 2,463 365 12 6 Broadcast Television 4,869 921 79 50 6 Filmed Entertainment 3,225 547 39 8 11 Theme Parks 2,740 1,088 332 772 36 Headquarters and Other (a) 39 ( 356 ) 227 84 77 Eliminations (b) ( 169 ) ( 2 ) — — — NBCUniversal 16,519 4,661 1,042 926 136 Sky 9,625 1,435 1,414 436 303 Corporate and Other (c) 164 ( 400 ) 69 36 13 Eliminations (b) ( 1,321 ) ( 9 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 53,717 $ 17,269 $ 6,596 $ 4,355 $ 1,078 (a) NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. (b) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue at Cable Networks for the sale of programming to Cable Communications; content licensing revenue in our NBCUniversal segments (Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Cable Networks) for the license of owned content to Peacock and Sky, and for licenses of owned content to other NBCUniversal segments; advertising revenue at Cable Communications, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television; and distribution revenue at Broadcast Television for fees received under retransmission consent agreements from Cable Communications. For segment reporting purposes, we account for intercompany content licenses as follows: • Revenue for licenses of content from NBCUniversal segments to Peacock and Sky are generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses at Peacock and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations as the profits on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. • Revenue for licenses of content between NBCUniversal segments is recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the programming rights asset for the licensed content as the content is used over the license period. (c) Corporate and Other activities include costs associated with overhead and personnel, revenue and expenses associated with our other business interests, including Peacock. (d) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.

We adopted new accounting guidance related to film and television costs in the first quarter of 2020 (see Note 8), and accordingly amounts presented below for periods in 2020 and the policy discussion reflect the updated accounting guidance, and amounts presented for 2019 reflect the accounting guidance in effect at that time. Under the new accounting guidance, we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. Amortization of Film and Television Costs (in millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 Owned film and television costs $ 1,539 $ 3,327 Programming rights $ 1,584 $ 4,248 Capitalized Film and Television Costs June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in millions) Film and Television Costs Film Costs Television Costs Total Owned film and television costs: Released, less amortization $ 3,929 $ 1,551 $ 2,810 $ 4,361 Completed, not released 73 187 — 187 In production and in development 2,439 1,314 1,162 2,476 6,441 3,052 3,972 7,024 Programming rights, less amortization 5,772 5,786 12,213 12,810 Less: Current portion of programming rights — 3,877 Film and television costs $ 12,213 $ 8,933 10 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation The table below summarizes estimated future amortization expense for the capitalized film and television costs recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2020 . (in millions) Owned Film and Television Costs Programming Rights Completed, not released: Remaining six months of 2020 $ 22 Released and programming rights: Remaining six months of 2020 $ 976 $ 2,786 2021 $ 809 $ 1,510 2022 $ 471 $ 664 Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Costs We capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residual payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution. We may enter into cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. Cofinancing arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor’s interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor’s interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method. We capitalize the costs of programming rights for content that we license but do not own when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of programming licenses are known. Programming rights are amortized as the associated programs are broadcast. Owned film and television costs and programming rights are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of film and television costs and accrued costs associated with participation and residual payments in programming and production costs. When an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned film and television content or programming rights is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned film and television costs are assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned film and television costs are evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Programming rights that are not part of a film group are generally assessed in packages, channels, or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Programming rights licensed by Cable Networks are primarily tested on a channel basis for impairment, whereas programming rights licensed by Broadcast Television are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned film and television costs or programming rights are generally based on level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented. Sports Programming Rights We recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports programming rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation the programming delivered, we recognize an asset in programming rights. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented in programming rights.

Our potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our stock options and our restricted share units (“RSUs”). Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in which the combination of the option exercise price and the associated unrecognized compensation expense is greater than the average market price of our common stock. The amount of potential common shares related to our share-based compensation plans that were excluded from diluted EPS because their effect would have been antidilutive was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 or 2019 . Note 6: Long-Term Debt As of June 30, 2020 , our debt had a carrying value of $ 104.8 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 124.7 billion . The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. 12 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 7: Significant Transactions Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. As of June 30, 2020 , Universal Beijing Resort had $ 1.8 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of June 30, 2020 , our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loan, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 3.7 billion and $ 2.6 billion , respectively. Note 8: Recent Accounting Pronouncements Film and Television Costs In March 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligned the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The guidance also updated certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs, and when content is predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content the guidance requires impairment testing for capitalized film and television costs to be performed at a film group level and amortization to be based on usage. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted. Following the adoption, we now present all film and television costs, including acquired programming rights previously classified as current, as noncurrent in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 4 for further information. Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables and loans. The updated guidance requires the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of expected losses, replacing the incurred loss model in the prior guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis, recording $ 124 million , net of tax, as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for any periods presented .

For the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we made cash capital contributions totaling $ 903 million to Hulu, inclusive of the funding to acquire our proportionate share of AT&T’s previously held 10 % interest. There were no cash capital contributions made during the six months ended June 30, 2020 . As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our investment was $ 533 million and $ 694 million , respectively. In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu. As of June 30, 2020 , both the carrying value and fair value of our collateralized obligation was $ 5.2 billion . The estimated fair value was based on level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value.

We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Cable Communications Segment Cable Communications is a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. As of June 30, 2020 , our cable systems had 32.1 million total customer relationships, including 29.8 million residential and 2.4 million business customer relationships, and passed more than 59 million homes and businesses. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services, which are marketed individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. NBCUniversal Segments NBCUniversal is one of the world’s leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks worldwide . Cable Networks Cable Networks consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations; and various digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers; from the sale of advertising on our cable networks and digital properties; from the licensing of our owned programming, including programming from our cable television studio production operations, to cable and broadcast networks and subscription video on demand services; and from the sale of our owned content on standard-definition DVDs and Blu-ray discs (together, “DVDs”) and through digital distribution services such as iTunes. Broadcast Television Broadcast Television consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of advertising on our networks and digital properties, from the licensing of programming, including to cable and broadcast networks as well as to subscription video on demand services; from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations; and from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Filmed Entertainment Filmed Entertainment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Revenue is generated primarily from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, from the licensing of produced and acquired films through various distribution platforms, and from the sale of produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Filmed Entertainment also generates revenue from Fandango, a movie ticketing and entertainment business, consumer products, the production and licensing of live stage plays, and the distribution of filmed entertainment produced by third parties. Theme Parks Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, and an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Revenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our Universal theme parks. Sky Segment Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. As of June 30, 2020 , Sky had 23.7 million retail customer relationships. 17 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, such as Peacock, which was made available to Comcast customers in April 2020 and launched nationally in July 2020. Impacts of COVID-19 The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe continue to impact our businesses in a number of ways. Our Cable Communications results of operations were strong in the first half of 2020, despite having been affected in the second quarter by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions and by the costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as people continued to work and learn remotely from home. COVID-19 had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations during the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to the temporary closure of our theme parks and the postponement and cancellation of many sporting events. We continue to implement and evaluate cost initiatives across our businesses that have impacted and will continue to impact our results of operations; certain costs incurred by our businesses in response to COVID-19, including severance and restructuring charges, are presented in Corporate and Other. We expect the impacts of COVID-19 will continue to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term. Cable Communications • Our distribution network to date has performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by increased video streaming, gaming and videoconferencing as more customers work and learn remotely from home. • We incurred costs during the first half of 2020 associated with compensating personnel in roles affected by COVID-19. These costs included additional compensation for frontline personnel who worked to keep our customers connected to our services and compensation for certain personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations. • We have pledged, continuing through the end of December 2020, that new qualifying customers for Internet Essentials, our low-income internet adoption program, will receive 60 days of free internet services. We also pledged through the end of June 2020 to waive certain fees and to not disconnect internet, voice or wireless services for customers for nonpayment, and are providing these customers a variety of flexible and extended payment options. As a result, our customer metrics for the first half of 2020 do not include certain high-risk customers who continue to receive service following nonpayment or customers in the free Internet Essentials offer . • Many professional sports leagues have resumed or have announced plans to resume, some with a reduced schedule for the remainder of the interrupted seasons. Certain of our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks include contractual adjustment provisions if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur. In the second quarter of 2020, our programming expenses were reduced as a result of these provisions, and our revenue was negatively impacted in similar amounts as a result of adjustments that we anticipate passing through to our customers. These provisions are also expected to impact future period revenue and expenses in 2020. The ultimate amounts and timing of the adjustments are dependent upon the extent to which the sports leagues are able to resume the interrupted seasons. • The deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 have resulted in reduced demand for our residential and business services and reduced spending from advertisers, which have had, and likely will continue to have, negative impacts on our revenue over the near to medium term. In addition, we believe there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increases in our bad debt expense compared to the prior year periods. NBCUniversal • The temporary closure of all of our theme parks in the first and second quarters of 2020 had the most significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 on a consolidated basis. Our parks in Orlando and Japan reopened with limited capacity in June 2020, while our park in Hollywood remains closed. We expect the results of operations at our theme parks will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term, and we cannot predict when the Hollywood park will reopen, if any reopened parks will remain open or the level of attendance at any reopened parks. In addition, although we currently expect that Universal Beijing Resort will open in 2021, we have delayed certain construction projects, including the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando. • The deterioration of economic conditions caused by COVID-19 resulted in significant reductions in advertising spend by our customers in the Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments in the second quarter of 2020, and we expect 18 Table of Contents this trend to continue over the near to medium term. These conditions have also resulted, and may continue to result, in an acceleration of subscriber losses at our networks due to reduced consumer spending. • We incurred costs during the first half of 2020 associated with compensating personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations, including at our theme parks and at our production studios. • The postponement and cancellation of many sporting events and professional sports seasons impacted our first and second quarter 2020 results of operations, since both advertising revenues and costs associated with broadcasting these programs were not recognized. Many professional sports leagues have resumed or have announced plans to resume, some with reduced numbers of events for the remainder of the interrupted seasons. Certain of our sports programming rights agreements and distribution agreements with multichannel video providers include contractual provisions if a minimum number of events does not occur. Our distribution revenue in the second quarter of 2020 was negatively impacted as a result of credits accrued relating to these provisions, and the programming costs that we will recognize as the remaining events occur, which are now expected to be primarily in the third quarter of 2020, will also be impacted. When, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur in 2020 will impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition. In addition, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics have been postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, which will result in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs. • The creation and availability of our film and television programming in the United States and globally have been disrupted, including from the suspension of studio production operations. Additionally, with the temporary closure of many movie theaters worldwide, we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally. Delays in theatrical releases will affect both current and future periods as a result of corresponding delays in subsequent content licensing windows. We expect results of operations in our Filmed Entertainment segment to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19. Sky • Many sporting events and professional sports seasons were postponed beginning in the second half of the first quarter of 2020, with certain sports, including European soccer, resuming in May and June 2020, which resulted in significant impacts on Sky’s results of operations in the first and second quarters of 2020. Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted as a result of lower sports subscription revenue and we expect continued negative impacts as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 on the reopening plans of our commercial customers. Additionally, significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs were not recognized as a result of the sporting events not occurring in the first quarter of 2020 and for most of the second quarter. Although sporting events have resumed, COVID-19 continues to result in uncertainty in the ultimate timing of when, or the extent to which, sporting events will occur in 2020; their broadcast is expected to impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition. • We temporarily suspended certain sales channels due to COVID-19, which negatively impacted net customer additions and revenue in the first and second quarters of 2020. Our sales channels generally resumed operations in June. • COVID-19 has resulted in the deterioration of economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe, intensifying what was an already deteriorating economic and advertising environment. These conditions negatively impacted revenue in the first and second quarters of 2020, and we expect will continue to reduce advertising spend and consumer demand for our services for the remainder of 2020. In addition, there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur increases in our bad debt expense. Global financial markets have been volatile and have experienced significant declines, and domestic and global economic conditions are showing signs of material weakness. At this point, it is impossible to predict the extent and duration of these and any other impacts of COVID-19 to our businesses, or the degree to which demand for our products and services, or supply of key inputs to those products and services, will be affected. This uncertainty makes it challenging for management to estimate with precision the future performance of our businesses. As of June 30, 2020, we evaluated whether the facts and circumstances and available information resulted in the need for an impairment assessment for any of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, and concluded no assessment was required. We will continue to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 to our businesses, including the impacts of overall economic conditions, which could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the future. Our first and second quarter 2020 results were impacted by significant losses and gains, respectively, as a result of the volatility in the market values for publicly traded equity securities underlying our investments. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity Although negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19, we expect that our businesses will continue to generate significant cash flow from operating activities and we believe that these cash flows, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain future external financing, will be sufficient for us to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements. However, we expect the timing of certain priorities to be impacted, such as the pace of our debt reduction efforts and return to share repurchases, and the delay of certain capital projects. Competition All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been viewed by consumers. This increase has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines at our programming channels. For additional information on the competition our businesses face, see our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and refer to Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the “Competition” discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled “Our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.” Seasonality and Cyclicality Each of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications’ results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year. Revenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains) are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, which affect Cable Networks and Broadcast Television, and the Super Bowl, which affects Broadcast Television. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees. Revenue in Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively. Revenue in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Revenue at Sky has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup TM . Revenue in Filmed Entertainment fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. Content licensing revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees. Revenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Theme Parks generally experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the Christmas holiday season. 20 Table of Contents Sky’s results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving direct-to-home (“DTH”) and over the top (“OTT”) video services, including the start of the new soccer seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the second half of each year due to higher marketing expenses. Exclusive sports rights, such as local European and Union des Associations Européennes de Football Champions League (“UCL”) soccer, Formula 1, and English cricket, play a key role within Sky’s wider content strategy. In Europe, broadcasting rights for major sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality for Sky, although the staggered timing of major sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market. Certain of Sky’s significant sports rights agreements require payments at the start of each season, resulting in increases in sports rights payments in the third and fourth quarter of each year.

Consolidated Revenue Theme Parks, Sky, Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment, Broadcast Television and Cable Communications drove decreases in consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2020 . Theme Parks, Sky, Filmed Entertainment and Cable Networks drove decreases in consolidated revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2020 , which were offset by increases in Cable Communications and Broadcast Television. Revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” 21 Table of Contents Consolidated Costs and Expenses Sky, Cable Networks, Theme Parks, Cable Communications, Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television drove decreases in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 . Sky, Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment, Theme Parks, Cable Communications and Broadcast Television drove decreases in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2020 . Operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, businesses development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 % 2020 2019 % Cable Communications $ 1,937 $ 2,036 (4.9 )% $ 3,883 $ 4,071 (4.6 )% NBCUniversal 574 527 8.9 1,139 1,042 9.3 Sky 720 673 7.0 1,438 1,414 1.7 Corporate and Other 33 40 (18.1 ) 68 69 (0.8 ) Comcast Consolidated $ 3,264 $ 3,276 (0.4 )% $ 6,528 $ 6,596 (1.0 )% Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in depreciation at Cable Communications related to a reduction in capital expenditures on customer premise equipment, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of certain trade names beginning in the first quarter of 2020, which were previously accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets (see Note 10). During the first quarter of 2019, we recorded adjustments to the purchase price allocation of Sky, primarily related to intangible assets and property and equipment. This change resulted in an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that increased depreciation and amortization expense by $53 million. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $565 million and $1.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets totaled $499 million and $1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to decreases in our debt outstanding. Interest expense increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to a $140 million charge in the first quarter of 2020 related to the early redemption of senior notes due 2021, partially offset by decreases in our debt outstanding.

The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments. The equity in net income (losses) of Atairos and Hulu for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the table below. 22 Table of Contents Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Atairos $ 446 $ (106 ) $ (135 ) $ 268 Hulu $ (79 ) $ (109 ) $ (161 ) $ (250 ) Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities, Net The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to gains related to our investment in Peloton of $86 million , which we sold in the second quarter of 2020, offset by losses on certain investments in the second quarter of 2020, compared to gains on investments, including $96 million related to our investment in Snap in the second quarter of 2019. The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to losses on certain investments for the six months ended June 30, 2020, partially offset by gains related to our investment in Peloton, which we sold in the second quarter of 2020, compared to gains on investments, including $258 million related to our investment in Snap, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2019. Other Income (Loss), Net The change in other income (loss), net for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily relates to foreign exchange remeasurement gains and gains related to insurance contracts in the second quarter of 2020, compared to foreign exchange remeasurement losses and an impairment of an equity method investment in the second quarter of 2019. The change in other income (loss), net for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily relates to foreign exchange remeasurement gains for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to a gain of $159 million recorded in the prior year period related to the dilution of our Hulu ownership. See Note 9. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The decrease in income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 was primarily due to lower income before income taxes. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes. 23 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 $ % Revenue Residential: High-speed internet $ 5,000 $ 4,663 $ 337 7.2 % Video 5,415 5,594 (179 ) (3.2 ) Voice 877 982 (105 ) (10.7 ) Wireless 326 244 82 33.9 Business services 2,004 1,933 71 3.6 Advertising 428 607 (179 ) (29.6 ) Other 378 427 (49 ) (11.0 ) Total revenue 14,428 14,450 (22 ) (0.2 ) Operating costs and expenses Programming 3,203 3,372 (169 ) (5.0 ) Technical and product support 1,933 1,898 35 1.8 Customer service 601 624 (23 ) (3.7 ) Advertising, marketing and promotion 834 1,004 (170 ) (16.9 ) Franchise and other regulatory fees 398 390 8 2.0 Other 1,283 1,308 (25 ) (1.9 ) Total operating costs and expenses 8,252 8,596 (344 ) (4.0 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 6,176 $ 5,854 $ 322 5.5 % Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 $ % Revenue Residential: High-speed internet $ 10,001 $ 9,240 $ 761 8.2 % Video 11,047 11,222 (175 ) (1.6 ) Voice 1,776 1,972 (196 ) (9.9 ) Wireless 669 469 200 42.6 Business services 4,047 3,824 223 5.8 Advertising 985 1,163 (178 ) (15.3 ) Other 821 840 (19 ) (2.1 ) Total revenue 29,346 28,730 616 2.1 Operating costs and expenses Programming 6,682 6,791 (109 ) (1.6 ) Technical and product support 3,945 3,778 167 4.4 Customer service 1,238 1,249 (11 ) (0.9 ) Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,788 1,976 (188 ) (9.5 ) Franchise and other regulatory fees 804 781 23 2.9 Other 2,637 2,573 64 2.5 Total operating costs and expenses 17,094 17,148 (54 ) (0.3 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 12,252 $ 11,582 $ 670 5.8 % 24 Table of Contents Customer Metrics Net Additions June 30, Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, (in thousands) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Customer relationships Residential customer relationships 29,750 28,508 241 123 601 399 Business services customer relationships 2,384 2,356 (24 ) 29 (12 ) 53 Total customer relationships 32,134 30,864 217 152 589 453 Residential customer relationships mix One product customers 11,332 9,526 531 231 1,085 512 Two product customers 8,742 8,952 (107 ) (57 ) (181 ) (40 ) Three or more product customers 9,676 10,030 (184 ) (50 ) (303 ) (72 ) High-speed internet Residential customers 27,220 25,631 340 182 806 534 Business services customers 2,209 2,176 (17 ) 28 (6 ) 51 Total high-speed internet customers 29,429 27,807 323 209 800 584 Video Residential customers 19,473 20,642 (427 ) (209 ) (814 ) (317 ) Business services customers 894 999 (51 ) (15 ) (72 ) (28 ) Total video customers 20,367 21,641 (477 ) (224 ) (887 ) (345 ) Voice Residential customers 9,698 10,008 (142 ) (82 ) (236 ) (145 ) Business services customers 1,331 1,324 (16 ) 17 (12 ) 27 Total voice customers 11,029 11,331 (158 ) (65 ) (248 ) (118 ) Wireless Wireless lines 2,393 1,586 126 181 342 351 Customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of June 30, 2020 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 286,000 and 9,000 , respectively. Wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics for 2020 do not include certain high-risk customers who continue to receive service following nonpayment or customers in the free Internet Essentials offer (refer to “Impacts of COVID-19” for further discussion). Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 150.17 $ 156.44 $ 153.61 $ 156.29 Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 64.28 $ 63.38 $ 64.13 $ 63.01 Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin and we also use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe these metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services . 25 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment – Revenue High-Speed Internet Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to increases in the number of residential high-speed internet customers and increases in average rates. Average rates in the second quarter of 2020 were negatively impacted by waived fees due to COVID-19 and the impacts of customer adjustments. Refer to video description for further information. Video Revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to declines in the number of residential video customers, partially offset by increases in average rates. Average rates in the second quarter of 2020 were negatively impacted by customer adjustments accrued as a result of provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events. For customers receiving bundled services, the revenue reduction was allocated across each of the services in the bundle. We have experienced, and expect that we will continue to experience, declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures, and we expect that our video revenue will continue to decline as a result of the economic and competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs, such as promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments. Voice Revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to decreases in average rates and the number of residential voice customers. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to increases in the number of customer lines. Business Services Revenue increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to increases in the number of customers receiving our services and increases in average rates. The rates of growth were reduced due to the negative impacts of COVID-19 on small businesses. Advertising Revenue decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19, partially offset by increases in political advertising. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, 4% of our advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Other Revenue decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to certain waived billing and collection fees due to COVID-19 and decreases in security and automation services, partially offset by an increase in the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers. Revenue decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to certain waived billing and collection fees due to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to adjustment provisions in our programming distribution agreements with regional sports networks related to canceled sporting events as a result of COVID-19. Excluding these adjustments, programming expenses increased due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming fees, partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers. We anticipate that our programming expenses will be impacted by higher rate increases compared to those experienced in 2019 due to the timing of contract renewals in 2020, partially offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers and potentially additional contractual adjustments for regional sports networks. 26 Table of Contents Technical and product support expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to increased costs related to COVID-19, including additional compensation costs for certain personnel, and also increased costs associated with our wireless phone service, partially offset by cost savings initiatives and a reduction in activity in certain aspects of our business. Customer service expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes, partially offset by increases in costs as a result of additional Xfinity stores. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to decreases in spending. Franchise and other regulatory fees increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to increases in the related rates of these fees. Other operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to decreased costs associated with our advertising business, partially offset by increases in bad debt expense as a result of COVID-19 and personnel-related costs. Other operating costs and expenses increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to increases in bad debt expense as a result of COVID-19 and personnel-related costs, partially offset by lower third party advertising costs. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services , and on reducing losses related to our wireless phone service and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 was 42.8% and 41.7% , respectively. While the accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2020, they resulted in an increase to operating margins. Our operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was 40.5% and 40.3% , respectively. The most significant operating costs and expenses are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which decreased 5.0% and 1.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019 . Losses from our wireless phone service were $37 million and $96 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , respectively, compared to losses of $88 million and $191 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively.

Distribution revenue decreased primarily due to credits accrued at some of our regional sports networks resulting from the reduced number of games planned by professional sports leagues due to COVID-19. Certain of our distribution agreements with multichannel video providers require contractual adjustments if a minimum number of sporting events does not occur. Excluding these credits, distribution revenue decreased due to increased declines in the number of subscribers at our cable networks, partially offset by increases in the contractual rates charged under distribution agreements. Advertising revenue decreased compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to reduced spending from advertisers as a result of COVID-19, including from the postponement and cancellation of sporting events and continued audience ratings declines at our networks. The decrease in advertising revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was partially offset by higher prices for advertising units sold.

Other expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses decreased primarily due to lower advertising costs, resulting from the impact of COVID-19.

Corporate and Other – Operating Costs and Expenses Expenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the costs of other business initiatives, such as Peacock, and operating costs and expenses associated with Comcast Spectacor. Expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to certain costs incurred in the second quarter of 2020 in response to COVID-19, including severance and restructuring charges related to our NBCUniversal segments, and costs associated with Peacock, which were partially offset by a reduction in costs related to the Sky transaction. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, Peacock costs include amortization of film and television costs and we expect to continue to incur significant costs related to additional content and marketing for the new platform. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA excludes Sky transaction-related costs.

Refer to Note 2 for further description of transactions between our segments. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. 35 Table of Contents We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income (loss), net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. Refer to “Impacts of COVID-19” for additional discussion. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of June 30, 2020 , amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion . Operating Activities Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Six Months Ended June 30, (in millions) 2020 2019 Operating income $ 9,499 $ 10,538 Depreciation and amortization 6,528 6,596 Noncash share-based compensation 621 533 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (15 ) 95 Payments of interest (1,936 ) (2,111 ) Payments of income taxes (333 ) (1,634 ) Other 103 254 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,467 $ 14,271 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 on the timing of our film and television costs, including sports rights, as well as the timing of our accounts payables and accrued expenses, which was partially offset by the timing of our accounts receivable. The decrease in payments of income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to the extension of due dates for second quarter 2020 federal estimated income tax payments to the third quarter. Payments of income taxes for the second half of 2020 will also include payments relating to the taxable gain associated with the AirTouch redemption which approximated the proceeds received. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, purchases of investments and cash paid for intangible assets. Capital expenditures decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to decreases in spending by our Cable Communications and Theme Parks segments. We anticipate further declines in spending across our segments as a result of COVID-19, even as we continue to invest in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our Cable Communications segment. Proceeds from sales of businesses and investments increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to $1.7 billion of proceeds received from the sale of our investment in AirTouch. See Note 9. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, dividend payments and payments related to the redemption and repayment of subsidiary preferred shares presented in other financing activities (see Note 9), which were partially offset by proceeds from borrowings. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt and dividend payments. In the first quarter of 2020, we issued $4.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes maturing between 2025 and 2040, $3.2 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed rate Euro senior notes maturing between 2027 and 2040 and $1.8 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed rate Sterling senior notes maturing between 2029 and 2036. In May 2020, we issued $4.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes maturing between 2031 and 2051. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 , we made debt repayments totaling $10.7 billion , including the early redemption and purchase of $9.0 billion of senior notes maturing between 2021 and 2047. 37 Table of Contents In June 2020, we announced our election to exercise our option to redeem at par $1.4 billion of senior notes due 2046 in August 2020. As of June 30, 2020 , we had no commercial paper outstanding and there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends Effective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $12 billion , which does not have an expiration date. Under the authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We have paused our share repurchase program in order to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky, and no common shares were repurchased under the authorization for the six months ended June 30, 2020 . We paid $269 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2020 , our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.92 per share on an annualized basis. In May 2020 , our Board of Directors approved our second quarter dividend of $0.23 per share paid in July 2020 . We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. On April 22, 2020 , we paid dividends of $1.1 billion . Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Debt subject to cross-guarantees Comcast $ 86.5 $ 80.4 NBCUniversal (a) 3.8 5.8 Comcast Cable (a) 2.1 2.1 92.4 88.3 Debt subject to one-way guarantees Sky 8.5 9.2 Other (a) 2.9 4.1 11.4 13.3 Debt not guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 1.8 1.3 Other 0.9 1.0 2.7 2.3 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (1.7 ) (1.7 ) Total debt $ 104.8 $ 102.2 (a) NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 7 for additional information. Cross-guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other’s debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and 38 Table of Contents other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on non-guarantor subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the combined Guarantors have noncurrent notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $123 billion and $122 billion , respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $23 billion and $21 billion , respectively. This financial information is that of the Guarantors presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between the Guarantors eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries are significantly in excess of the Guarantor obligations. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, the Guarantors do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. One-way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $185 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis; and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries (for purposes of this Comcast Holdings discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , Comcast and Comcast Holdings, the combined issuer and guarantor of the guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $93 billion and $92 billion , respectively, and noncurrent notes receivable from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $20 billion and $18 billion , respectively. This financial information is that of Comcast and Comcast Holdings presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. The underlying net assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of Comcast and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in non-guarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Exhibits 36 SIGNATURES 37 Explanatory Note Beginning with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2020, we are voluntarily complying with new disclosure rules for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed debt securities issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in March 2020, as permitted by the transition guidance contained in the SEC’s final rule release “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant’s Securities.” As a result, this report includes new disclosures related to our consolidated subsidiaries that guarantee or have issued guaranteed debt securities registered with the SEC that are included within our guarantee structure (refer to Guarantee Structure within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). As a result of these rules, NBCUniversal Media, LLC is no longer required to prepare stand-alone periodic reports under SEC rules, and our periodic reports are no longer prepared as a combined report being filed separately by Comcast Corporation and NBCUniversal Media, LLC. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “Comcast,” “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal, LLC as “NBCUniversal Holdings;” NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. as “NBCUniversal Enterprise;” NBCUniversal Media, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “NBCUniversal;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three months ended March 31, 2020 . This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The SEC allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should carefully review the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and particularly consider any risk factors set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called “forward-looking statements” by words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks outlined below and in other reports we file with the SEC. Actual events or our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations • our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ and Sky’s video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • we rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Consolidated Financial Statements Business and Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in six reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Cable Communications is a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Cable Networks consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations; and various digital properties. Broadcast Television consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Filmed Entertainment consists primarily of the operations of Universal Pictures, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide; our films are also produced under the Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, and an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, such as the development of Peacock, our direct-to-consumer streaming service that will feature NBCUniversal content. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 14,918 $ 6,076 $ 1,946 $ 1,269 $ 356 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 2,859 1,248 195 5 3 Broadcast Television 2,684 501 43 25 3 Filmed Entertainment 1,370 106 22 4 5 Theme Parks 869 76 189 296 15 Headquarters and Other (a) 23 ( 187 ) 116 47 41 Eliminations (b) ( 71 ) 3 — — — NBCUniversal 7,734 1,747 565 377 67 Sky 4,517 551 718 197 166 Corporate and Other (c) 120 ( 252 ) 35 38 29 Eliminations (b) ( 680 ) 8 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 26,609 $ 8,130 $ 3,264 $ 1,881 $ 618 Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 14,280 $ 5,728 $ 2,035 $ 1,363 $ 323 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 2,868 1,262 182 6 2 Broadcast Television 2,467 387 39 13 3 Filmed Entertainment 1,768 364 19 4 5 Theme Parks 1,276 498 162 394 19 Headquarters and Other (a) 17 ( 174 ) 113 36 42 Eliminations (b) ( 83 ) — — — — NBCUniversal 8,313 2,337 515 453 71 Sky 4,797 663 741 259 151 Corporate and Other (c) 108 ( 187 ) 29 17 2 Eliminations (b) ( 639 ) 12 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 26,859 $ 8,553 $ 3,320 $ 2,092 $ 547 (a) NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. (b) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. The most common types of transactions are the following: • Cable Networks generates revenue by selling programming to Cable Communications, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue elimination amount • Broadcast Television generates revenue from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements with Cable Communications • Cable Communications generates revenue by selling advertising and by selling the use of satellite feeds to Cable Networks • Cable Networks and Broadcast Television generate revenue by selling advertising to Cable Communications • Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television generate revenue by licensing content to Cable Networks; for segment reporting, this revenue is recognized as the programming rights asset for the licensed content is amortized based on third-party revenue • Filmed Entertainment, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television generate revenue by licensing content to Sky; for segment reporting, this revenue is recognized as content is delivered and available for use by Sky (c) Corporate and Other activities include costs associated with overhead and personnel, revenue and expenses associated with our other business interests. (d) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below. 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,130 $ 8,553 Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs ( 14 ) ( 51 ) Depreciation ( 2,107 ) ( 2,240 ) Amortization ( 1,157 ) ( 1,080 ) Interest expense ( 1,212 ) ( 1,150 ) Investment and other income (loss), net ( 716 ) 676 Income before income taxes $ 2,924 $ 4,708 Note 3: Revenue Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Residential: High-speed internet $ 5,001 $ 4,577 Video 5,632 5,628 Voice 899 990 Wireless 343 225 Business services 2,043 1,891 Advertising 557 556 Other 443 413 Total Cable Communications (a) 14,918 14,280 Distribution 1,708 1,735 Advertising 834 852 Content licensing and other 317 281 Total Cable Networks 2,859 2,868 Advertising 1,318 1,317 Content licensing 735 560 Distribution and other 631 590 Total Broadcast Television 2,684 2,467 Theatrical 317 445 Content licensing 691 817 Home entertainment 171 267 Other 191 239 Total Filmed Entertainment 1,370 1,768 Total Theme Parks 869 1,276 Headquarters and Other 23 17 Eliminations (b) ( 71 ) ( 83 ) Total NBCUniversal 7,734 8,313 Direct-to-consumer 3,679 3,834 Content 325 370 Advertising 513 593 Total Sky 4,517 4,797 Corporate and Other 120 108 Eliminations (b) ( 680 ) ( 639 ) Total revenue $ 26,609 $ 26,859 (a) For both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , 2.6 % of Cable Communications segment revenue was derived from franchise and other regulatory fees.

Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet The following tables summarize our accounts receivable and other balances that are not separately presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheet that relate to the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash , as well as deferred costs associated with our contracts with customers.

We adopted new accounting guidance related to film and television costs in 2020 (see Note 8) , and accordingly amounts presented below for periods in 2020 and the policy discussion reflect the updated accounting guidance, and amounts presented for 2019 reflect the accounting guidance in effect at that time. Under the new accounting guidance, we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. Amortization of Film and Television Costs Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2020 Owned film and television costs $ 1,788 Programming rights $ 2,664 9 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Capitalized Film and Television Costs March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 (in millions) Film and Television Costs Film Costs Television Costs Total Owned film and television costs: Released, less amortization $ 4,317 $ 1,551 $ 2,810 $ 4,361 Completed, not released 238 187 — 187 In production and in development 2,509 1,314 1,162 2,476 7,064 3,052 3,972 7,024 Programming rights, less amortization 5,321 5,786 12,385 12,810 Less: Current portion of programming rights — 3,877 Film and television costs $ 12,385 $ 8,933 The table below summarizes estimated future amortization expense for the capitalized film and television costs recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2020. (in millions) Owned Film and Television Costs Programming Rights Completed, not released: Remaining nine months of 2020 $ 119 Released and programming rights: Remaining nine months of 2020 $ 1,485 $ 2,775 2021 $ 672 $ 1,197 2022 $ 418 $ 433 Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Costs We capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residual payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution. We may enter into cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. Cofinancing arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor’s interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor’s interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method. We capitalize the costs of programming rights for content that we license but do not own when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of programming licenses are known. Programming rights are amortized as the associated programs are broadcast . Owned film and television costs and programming rights are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of film and television costs and accrued costs associated with participation and residual payments in programming and production costs. When an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned film and television content or programming rights is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, 10 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned film and television costs are assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned film and television costs are evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Programming rights that are not part of a film group are generally assessed in packages, channels, or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Programming rights licensed by Cable Networks are primarily tested on a channel basis for impairment, whereas programming rights licensed by Broadcast Television are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned film and television costs or programming rights are generally based on level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented. Sports Programming Rights We recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports programming rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the terms of the contract. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the programming delivered, we recognize an asset in programming rights.

Our potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our stock options and our restricted share units (“RSUs”). Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in which the combination of the option exercise price and the associated unrecognized compensation expense is greater than the average market price of our common stock. The amount of potential common shares related to our share-based compensation plans that were excluded from diluted EPS because their effect would have been antidilutive was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2020 or 2019 . Note 6: Long-Term Debt As of March 31, 2020 , our debt had a carrying value of $ 103.6 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 118.8 billion . The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. In April 2020, Sky repaid at maturity $ 655 million (using the exchange rate on the date of repayment) aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due 2020. 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 7: Significant Transactions Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. As of March 31, 2020 , Universal Beijing Resort had $ 1.5 billion principal amount of a term loan outstanding under the debt financing agreement. As of March 31, 2020 , our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loan, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 3.4 billion and $ 2.3 billion , respectively. Note 8: Recent Accounting Pronouncements Film and Television Costs In March 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligned the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The guidance also updated certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs, and when content is predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content the guidance requires impairment testing for capitalized film and television costs to be performed at a film group level and amortization to be based on usage. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted. Following the adoption, we now present all film and television costs, including acquired programming rights previously classified as current, as noncurrent in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. See Note 4 for further information. Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables and loans. The updated guidance requires the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of expected losses, replacing the incurred loss model in the prior guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis recording $ 124 million , net of tax, as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for any periods presented .

As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our investment was $ 2.8 billion and $ 3.2 billion , respectively. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation For the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , we recognized our proportionate share of Hulu’s losses of $ 82 million and $ 141 million , respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net and in the first quarter 2019, we recognized a previously deferred dilution gain of $ 159 million . For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we made cash capital contributions totaling $ 233 million to Hulu. There were no cash capital contributions made during the three months ended March 31, 2020 . As of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our investment was $ 612 million and $ 694 million , respectively. In 2019, we borrowed $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024 which is fully collateralized by the minimum guaranteed proceeds of the put/call option related to our investment in Hulu . As of March 31, 2020 , the carrying value and fair value of our collateralized obligation was $ 5.2 billion . The estimated fair value was based on level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation,” respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. Marketable Equity Securities Peloton Following Peloton’s initial public offering in September 2019, we present our investment in marketable equity securities, which was previously presented in nonmarketable equity securities.

We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Cable Communications Segment Cable Communications is a leading provider of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. As of March 31, 2020 , our cable systems had 31.9 million total customer relationships, including 29.5 million residential and 2.4 million business customer relationships, and passed more than 59 million homes and businesses. Revenue is generated primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our services, which are marketed individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. NBCUniversal Segments NBCUniversal is one of the world’s leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks worldwide . Cable Networks Cable Networks consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations; and various digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers; from the sale of advertising on our cable networks and digital properties; from the licensing of our owned programming, including programming from our cable television studio production operations, to cable and broadcast networks and subscription video on demand services; and from the sale of our owned content on standard-definition DVDs and Blu-ray discs (together, “DVDs”) and through digital distribution services such as iTunes. Broadcast Television Broadcast Television consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Revenue is generated primarily from the sale of advertising on our networks and digital properties, from the licensing of programming, including to cable and broadcast networks as well as to subscription video on demand services; from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations; and from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Filmed Entertainment Filmed Entertainment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Revenue is generated primarily from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, from the licensing of produced and acquired films through various distribution platforms, and from the sale of produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Filmed Entertainment also generates revenue from Fandango, a movie ticketing and entertainment business, consumer products, the production and licensing of live stage plays, and the distribution of filmed entertainment produced by third parties. Theme Parks Theme Parks consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, and an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Revenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our Universal theme parks. Sky Segment Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. As of March 31, 2020 , Sky had 23.9 million retail customer relationships. 16 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, such as the development of Peacock. Impacts of COVID-19 The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe are impacting our businesses in a number of ways. Our Cable Communications results of operations, while strong in the first quarter 2020, will be negatively affected in the second quarter by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions in recent weeks and by the costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as the population increasingly works and learns remotely from home. NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations also will be negatively impacted to a greater extent in the second quarter 2020. As a result, we expect the impacts of COVID-19 to increase in significance in the second quarter 2020 and to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term. Cable Communications • Our distribution network to date has performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by increased video streaming, gaming and videoconferencing as more customers work and learn remotely from home. • We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur in the second quarter of 2020, costs associated with compensating personnel in roles affected by COVID-19. These costs include additional compensation for frontline personnel working to keep our customers connected to our services, and compensation for certain personnel in roles who have been unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations. • We have pledged from mid-March 2020 through the end of June 2020 that new qualifying customers for Internet Essentials, our low-income internet adoption program, are entitled to receive 60 days of free internet services and not to disconnect internet, voice or wireless service for customers for nonpayment. As a result, our customer metrics for the first quarter of 2020 do not include customers connected through the Internet Essentials offer or certain high-risk customers who continue to receive services following nonpayment. • The deteriorating economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 may result in reduced demand for our residential and business services and have had, and likely will continue to have, negative impacts on our advertising revenue. In addition, we believe there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, losses in our allowance for doubtful accounts. NBCUniversal • The temporary closure of all of our theme parks in the first quarter of 2020 had the most significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2020 on a consolidated basis. We cannot predict the timing of when the parks will reopen or the level of attendance when they do reopen. In addition, although we currently expect that Universal Beijing Resort will open in 2021, certain construction projects, including the development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando, will be delayed. • While the deteriorating economic conditions caused by COVID-19 had a limited negative impact on our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television revenue in the first quarter of 2020, we expect significant reductions in advertising spend for the remainder of 2020 and reduced consumer spending generally may cause increased losses in subscribers to our networks. • We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur in the second quarter of 2020, costs associated with compensating personnel who have been unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operations, including at our theme parks and at our production studios. • Sporting events and professional sports seasons have been postponed, which have impacted our first quarter 2020 results of operations, since both advertising revenues and costs associated with broadcasting these programs were not recognized. The timing of when, or the extent to which, these events will occur in 2020 is unclear; their broadcast is expected to impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition. In addition, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics have been postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021 which will result in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs. • The creation and availability of our film and television programming in the United States and globally have been disrupted, including from the suspension of studio production operations. Additionally, with many movie theaters being closed worldwide, we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally. 17 Table of Contents Sky • Sporting events and professional sports seasons, including European soccer, have been postponed, which had significant impacts on Sky’s results of operations in the first quarter of 2020. Direct-to-consumer revenue has been, and will continue to be, negatively impacted as a result of lower sports subscription revenue. Additionally, significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs were not recognized as a result of sporting events not occurring in March of 2020. The timing of when, or the extent to which, these events will occur in 2020 is unclear; their broadcast is expected to impact the timing, and potentially the amount, of revenue and expense recognition. • We have suspended certain sales channels due to COVID-19, which has and will continue to impact our net customer additions and revenue. • COVID-19 has resulted in deteriorating economic conditions and increased economic uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe, intensifying what was an already deteriorating economic and advertising environment in 2019. These conditions negatively impacted revenue in the first quarter of 2020, and we expect these conditions will reduce advertising spend and consumer demand for our services for the remainder of 2020. In addition, there is increased risk associated with collections on our outstanding receivables, and we have incurred and expect to continue to incur losses in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Global financial markets have been volatile and have experienced significant declines, and domestic and global economic conditions are showing signs of material weakness. At this point, it is impossible to predict the extent and duration of these and any other impacts of COVID-19 to our businesses, or the degree to which demand for our products and services, or supply of key inputs to those products and services, will be affected. This uncertainty makes it challenging for management to estimate with precision the future performance of our businesses. As of March 31, 2020, we evaluated whether the facts and circumstances and available information result in the need for an impairment assessment for any of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, and concluded no assessment was required. We will continue to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 to our businesses, including the impacts of overall economic conditions, which could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the future. Our first quarter 2020 results were impacted by significant losses as a result of declines in market values for publicly traded equity securities underlying our investments. Liquidity Although negatively impacted by COVID-19 impacts, we expect that our businesses will continue to generate significant cash flow from operating activities and we believe that these cash flows, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, available borrowings under our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain future external financing, will be sufficient for us to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements. However, we expect the timing of certain priorities to be impacted, such as the pace of our debt reduction efforts and the delay of certain capital projects. Competition All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available to consumers has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been viewed by consumers. This increase has caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines at our programming channels. For additional information on the competition our businesses face, see our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and refer to Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the “Competition” discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled “Our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “Changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.” Seasonality and Cyclicality Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications’ results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year. 18 Table of Contents Revenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains) are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, which affect Cable Networks and Broadcast Television, and the Super Bowl, which affects Broadcast Television. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees. Revenue in Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising, respectively. Revenue in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Revenue at Sky has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup TM . Revenue in Filmed Entertainment fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. Content licensing revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees. Revenue in Theme Parks fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Theme Parks generally experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the Christmas holiday season. Sky’s results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving direct-to-home (“DTH”) and over the top (“OTT”) video services, including the start of the new soccer seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the second half of each year due to higher marketing expenses. Exclusive sports rights, such as local European and Union des Associations Européennes de Football Champions League (“UCL”) soccer, Formula 1, and English cricket, play a key role within Sky’s wider content strategy. In Europe, broadcasting rights for major sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality for Sky, although the staggered timing of major sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market. Certain of Sky’s significant sports rights agreements require payments at the start of each season, resulting in increases in sports rights payments in the third and fourth quarter of each year. 19 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions, except per share data) 2020 2019 % Revenue $ 26,609 $ 26,859 (0.9 )% Costs and Expenses: Programming and production 8,301 8,569 (3.1 ) Other operating and administrative 8,254 7,900 4.5 Advertising, marketing and promotion 1,938 1,888 2.6 Depreciation 2,107 2,240 (5.9 ) Amortization 1,157 1,080 7.1 Operating income 4,852 5,182 (6.4 ) Interest expense (1,212 ) (1,150 ) 5.4 Investment and other income (loss), net (716 ) 676 (205.7 ) Income before income taxes 2,924 4,708 (37.9 ) Income tax expense (700 ) (1,076 ) (35.0 ) Net income 2,224 3,632 (38.8 ) Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock 77 79 (2.0 ) Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 2,147 $ 3,553 (39.6 )% Basic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.47 $ 0.78 (39.7 )% Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.46 $ 0.77 (40.3 )% Adjusted EBITDA (a) $ 8,130 $ 8,553 (4.9 )% All percentages are calculated based on actual amounts.

Consolidated Revenue Theme Parks, Filmed Entertainment, Sky and Cable Networks drove decreases in consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , which were offset by increases in revenue in Cable Communications and Broadcast Television. Revenue for our segments and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Costs and Expenses Cable Communications, Broadcast Television, Theme Parks and Cable Networks drove increases in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2020 , which were partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses in Sky and Filmed Entertainment. Operating costs and expenses for our segments and our corporate operations, businesses development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 % Cable Communications $ 1,946 $ 2,035 (4.3 )% NBCUniversal 565 515 9.8 Sky 718 741 (3.1 ) Corporate and Other 35 29 23.0 Comcast Consolidated $ 3,264 $ 3,320 (1.7 )% Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in depreciation at Cable Communications related to a reduction in capital expenditures on customer premise equipment, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of certain trade names beginning in the first 20 Table of Contents quarter of 2020, which were previously accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets (see Note 10). During the first quarter of 2019, we recorded adjustments to the purchase price allocation of Sky, primarily related to intangible assets and property and equipment. This change resulted in an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that increased depreciation and amortization expense by $53 million. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $575 million and $504 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011. Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to a $140 million charge in the current period related to the early redemption of senior notes due 2021, partially offset by decreases in our debt outstanding. Consolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ (668 ) $ 262 Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net (58 ) 214 Other income (loss), net 10 200 Total investment and other income (loss), net $ (716 ) $ 676 Equity in Net Income (Losses) of Investees, Net The change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to our equity method investments in Atairos and Hulu. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments. The equity in net income (losses) of Atairos and Hulu for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the table below. Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Atairos $ (581 ) $ 374 Hulu $ (82 ) $ (141 ) Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities, Net The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to investment losses in the first quarter of 2020, compared to gains of $162 million recorded in the prior year period related to our interest in Snap, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2019. Other Income (Loss), Net The change in other income (loss), net for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to a gain of $159 million recorded in the prior year period related to the dilution of our Hulu ownership. See Note 9. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to lower income before income taxes. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes. 21 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 $ % Revenue Residential: High-speed internet $ 5,001 $ 4,577 $ 424 9.3 % Video 5,632 5,628 4 0.1 Voice 899 990 (91 ) (9.2 ) Wireless 343 225 118 52.1 Business services 2,043 1,891 152 8.0 Advertising 557 556 1 0.3 Other 443 413 30 7.0 Total revenue 14,918 14,280 638 4.5 Operating costs and expenses Programming 3,479 3,419 60 1.7 Technical and product support 2,012 1,880 132 7.0 Customer service 637 625 12 1.9 Advertising, marketing and promotion 954 972 (18 ) (1.9 ) Franchise and other regulatory fees 406 391 15 3.8 Other 1,354 1,265 89 7.1 Total operating costs and expenses 8,842 8,552 290 3.4 Adjusted EBITDA $ 6,076 $ 5,728 $ 348 6.1 % 22 Table of Contents Customer Metrics Net Additions March 31, Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Customer relationships Residential customer relationships 29,509 28,385 360 276 Business services customer relationships 2,408 2,327 11 25 Total customer relationships 31,917 30,712 371 300 Residential customer relationships mix One product customers 10,801 9,295 554 280 Two product customers 8,848 9,009 (75 ) 17 Three or more product customers 9,860 10,081 (119 ) (22 ) High-speed internet Residential customers 26,880 25,449 466 352 Business services customers 2,226 2,148 11 23 Total high-speed internet customers 29,106 27,598 477 375 Video Residential customers 19,900 20,852 (388 ) (107 ) Business services customers 944 1,014 (22 ) (14 ) Total video customers 20,845 21,865 (409 ) (121 ) Voice Residential customers 9,840 10,089 (94 ) (63 ) Business services customers 1,347 1,307 5 10 Total voice customers 11,187 11,396 (89 ) (53 ) Wireless Wireless lines 2,267 1,405 216 170 Customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of March 31, 2020 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 246,000 and 9,000 , respectively. Wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Customer metrics for the first quarter of 2020 do not include customers connected through a new free Internet Essentials offer or high-risk customers who continue to receive services following nonpayment (refer to “Impacts of COVID-19” for further discussion). Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship $ 156.71 $ 155.75 Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship $ 63.83 $ 62.48 Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our residential high-speed internet, video and voice services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Each of our services has a different contribution to operating margin and we also use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe these metrics are useful to understand the trends in our business and average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services . Cable Communications Segment – Revenue High-Speed Internet Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the number of residential high-speed internet customers. The remaining increase in revenue was due to an increase in average rates. 23 Table of Contents Video Revenue was flat for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to an increase in average rates, offset by a decline in the number of residential video customers. We have experienced, and expect that we will continue to experience, declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures, and we expect that our video revenue will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs, such as promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments. Voice Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to decreases in average rates and the number of residential voice customers. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines. Business Services Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to an increase in average rates and an increase in the number of customers receiving our services. Advertising Revenue was flat for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 as increases in political advertising were offset by reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19. We expect reduced spending from advertisers over the near to medium term as a result of deteriorating economic conditions resulting from COVID-19. For both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , 5% of our advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Other Revenue increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to increases in revenue from our security and automation services and from the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to an increase in retransmission consent and sports programming fees, partially offset by a decline in the number of video subscribers. We anticipate that our programming expenses will increase at rates higher than those experienced in 2019, due to the timing of contract renewals in 2020. Technical and product support expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service and additional compensation costs for certain personnel as a result of COVID-19. Customer service expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to an increase in costs as a result of opening new Xfinity stores, partially offset by lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in spending. Franchise and other regulatory fees increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the related rates of these fees and an increase in the revenue to which the fees apply. Other operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of COVID-19 and an increase in administrative expenses. 24 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services , and on reducing losses related to our wireless phone service and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 was 40.7% and 40.1% , respectively. The most significant operating costs and expenses are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which increased 1.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . Losses from our wireless phone service were $59 million in the current year period compared to losses of $103 million in the prior year period.

The decrease in distribution revenue was primarily due to increased declines in the number of subscribers at our cable networks, partially offset by increases in the contractual rates charged under distribution agreements and the timing of contract renewals. Advertising revenue decreased compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to audience ratings declines at our networks and reduced spending from advertisers resulting from professional sports leagues postponing events due to COVID-19, which was partially offset by higher prices for advertising units sold. We expect reduced spending from advertisers over the near to medium term as a result of deteriorating economic conditions due to COVID-19. The increase in content licensing and other revenue was due to the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements and revenue from our digital properties. For both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , 15% of our Cable Networks segment revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Cable Networks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses remained flat for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 as increases in other operating and administrative costs were offset by decreases in programming and production costs. The increase in other operating and administrative costs was primarily due to our digital properties and employee-related costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was primarily due to decreases in the recognition of sports programming costs as a result of professional sports leagues postponing events as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by increases in other programming costs at our networks.

The increase in content licensing revenue was primarily due to the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements. The increase in distribution and other revenue was pri marily due to increases in fees recognized under our retransmission consent agreements. Advertising revenue was flat for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 as higher prices for advertising units sold and increased political advertising were offset by continued declines in audience ratings and reduced spending from advertisers due to COVID-19. We expect reduced spending from advertisers over the near to medium term as a result of deteriorating economic conditions resulting from COVID-19. 26 Table of Contents Broadcast Television Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to increases in programming and production costs and other operating and administrative costs. The increase in programming and production costs was primarily due to increases in costs related to original and acquired programming and higher studio production costs. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the adoption of updated accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2020, which removed certain limitations on the amounts capitalized for episodic television series and had a favorable impact on programming and production expense in the current period (see Note 8). The increase in other operating and administrative costs and expenses was primarily due to additional personnel costs.

The decrease in theatrical revenue was primarily due to strong performances of films in the prior year period, including How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World , Us and Glass , partially offset by the performances of films in the current year period, including 1917, Dolittle, The Invisible Man and The Photograph. Films released late in the first quarter of 2020 were negatively impacted by theater closures as a result of COVID-19. The decrease in content licensing revenue was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements, partially offset by the impacts of making certain 2020 releases available on demand after theater closures due to COVID-19, including The Invisible Man, Emma. and The Hunt. The decrease in home entertainment revenue was primarily due to higher sales of 2019 releases, including Dr. Seuss ’ The Grinch, Halloween and Night School compared to the sales of 2020 releases, including 1917 and Downton Abbey and continued sales of Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to decreases in revenue from our live stage play and movie ticketing and entertainment businesses, which were impacted by theater and entertainment venue closures as a result of COVID-19. Filmed Entertainment revenue is expected to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19. Filmed Entertainment Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to decreases in programming and production costs and advertising, marketing and promotion costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was primarily due to higher amortization of film production costs in the prior year period. The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion costs was due to higher spending on the marketing of prior year period releases and lower spending in the current period. 27 Table of Contents Theme Parks Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2020 2019 $ % Revenue $ 869 $ 1,276 $ (407 ) (31.9 )% Operating costs and expenses 793 778 15 1.8 Adjusted EBITDA $ 76 $ 498 $ (422 ) (84.7 )% Theme Parks Segment – Revenue Theme Parks revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to the closures of our theme park in Japan in late February and our theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood in mid-March as a result of COVID-19. Theme Parks results of operations will continue to be negatively impacted in the near term and the extent of the impacts will depend on when the parks reopen and the level of attendance when they do reopen. Theme Parks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Theme Parks operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to increases in employee-related costs, which included continued compensation during park closures, and pre-opening costs associated with Universal Beijing Resort and Super Nintendo World TM in Universal Japan, partially offset by lower costs relating to park operations due to the park closures.

Each of Sky’s services has a different contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. We believe this metric is useful in understanding the trends in our business across all of our direct-to-consumer service offerings. Sky Segment – Revenue Direct-to-Consumer Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in average revenue per customer relationship driven by the impacts of COVID-19, which has resulted in lower sports subscription revenues, partially offset by an increase in customer relationships compared to the prior year period. Content Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased reflecting the deferral of wholesale revenue from sports programming due to professional sports leagues postponing events as a result of COVID-19. Advertising Revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, revenue decreased primarily due to overall market weakness, which has worsened due to COVID-19, as well as the impact of changes in legislation related to gambling advertisements in the U.K. and Italy that occurred in the third quarter of 2019. Sky Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs decreased primarily due to decreases in the recognition of sports programming costs as a result of professional sports leagues postponing events as a result of COVID-19. The costs will be recognized in future periods to the extent that the seasons resume . Direct network costs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct network costs increased primarily due to an increase in costs associated with Sky’s high-speed internet and wireless phone services as a result of increases in the number of customers receiving these services. Other expenses were flat for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses increased primarily due to an increase in marketing costs related to Sky Q.

Corporate and Other – Revenue Revenue primarily relates to Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 29 Table of Contents Corporate and Other – Operating Costs and Expenses Expenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the costs of other business initiatives, such as the development of Peacock and operating costs and expenses associated with Comcast Spectacor. Expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to startup costs associated with Peacock, which were partially offset by a reduction in costs related to the Sky transaction. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA excludes Sky transaction-related costs. We launched Peacock in April 2020 and expect to continue to incur significant costs to develop and scale our direct-to-consumer streaming service. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income (loss), net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 2,147 $ 3,553 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock 77 79 Income tax expense 700 1,076 Investment and other (income) loss, net 716 (676 ) Interest expense 1,212 1,150 Depreciation 2,107 2,240 Amortization 1,157 1,080 Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs 14 51 Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,130 $ 8,553 30 Table of Contents Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. Refer to “Impacts of COVID-19” for additional discussion. We maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of March 31, 2020 , amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion . Operating Activities Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Three Months Ended March 31, (in millions) 2020 2019 Operating income $ 4,852 $ 5,182 Depreciation, amortization and other operating gains 3,264 3,320 Noncash share-based compensation 298 245 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (1,393 ) (535 ) Payments of interest (991 ) (970 ) Payments of income taxes (281 ) (189 ) Other 75 178 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,824 $ 7,231 31 Table of Contents The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to the timing of our film and television costs, including sports rights, and collections on receivables, which were impacted by COVID-19. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and purchase of investments. Capital expenditures decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to decreases in spending by our Theme Parks, Cable Communications and Sky segments. We anticipate further declines in spending across our segments as a result of COVID-19, even as we continue to invest in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity in our Cable Communications segment. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 consisted primarily of proceeds from borrowings, partially offset by repayments of debt, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans. In February 2020, we issued $3.2 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed rate Euro senior notes maturing between 2027 and 2040 and $1.8 billion (using exchange rates on the date of issuance) of fixed rate Sterling senior notes maturing between 2029 and 2036. In March 2020, we issued $4.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes maturing between 2025 and 2040. For the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we made debt repayments totaling $7.4 billion , including the early redemption of $6.5 billion of senior notes maturing between 2021 and 2047. As of March 31, 2020 , we had no commercial paper outstanding and there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities. Share Repurchases and Dividends Effective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $12 billion , which does not have an expiration date. Under the authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We have paused our share repurchase program in order to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky, and no common shares were repurchased under the authorization for the three months ended March 31, 2020 . We paid $233 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2020 , our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.92 per share on an annualized basis. In January 2020 , our Board of Directors approved our first quarter dividend of $0.23 per share to be paid in April 2020 . We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. On January 29, 2020 , we paid dividends of $977 million . Guarantee Structure Our debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt. 32 Table of Contents Debt and Guarantee Structure (in billions) March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Debt subject to cross-guarantees Comcast $ 83.8 $ 80.4 NBCUniversal (a) 3.7 5.8 Comcast Cable (a) 2.1 2.1 89.6 88.3 Debt subject to one-way guarantees Sky 9.0 9.2 Other (a) 4.1 4.1 13.1 13.3 Debt not guaranteed Universal Beijing Resort (b) 1.5 1.3 Other 1.1 1.0 2.6 2.3 Debt issuance costs, premiums, discounts, fair value adjustments for acquisition accounting and hedged positions, net (1.7 ) (1.7 ) Total debt $ 103.6 $ 102.2 (a) NBCUniversal, Comcast Cable and Comcast Holdings (included within other debt subject to one-way guarantees) are each consolidated subsidiaries subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. The guarantee structures and related disclosures in this section, together with Exhibit 22, satisfy these reporting obligations. (b) Universal Beijing Resort debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. See Note 7 for additional information. Cross-guarantees Comcast, NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable (the “Guarantors”) fully and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantee each other's debt securities. NBCUniversal and Comcast Cable also guarantee other borrowings of Comcast, including its revolving credit facility. These guarantees rank equally with all other general unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the respective Guarantors. However, the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of their respective non-guarantor subsidiaries. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount that would not render such Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law. Each Guarantor’s obligations will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed securities have been paid in full. However, a guarantee by NBCUniversal or Comcast Cable of Comcast’s debt securities, or by NBCUniversal of Comcast Cable’s debt securities, will terminate upon a disposition of such Guarantor entity or all or substantially all of its assets. The Guarantors are each holding companies that principally hold investments in, borrow from and lend to, subsidiary operating companies; issue and service third-party debt obligations; repurchase shares and pay dividends; and engage in certain corporate and headquarters activities. The Guarantors are generally dependent on subsidiary operating companies to fund these activities. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2020 , the combined Guarantors in the aggregate have notes payable to and receivable from other Comcast subsidiaries of $123.9 billion and $19.9 billion , respectively. The underlying net assets of the subsidiary operating companies are significantly in excess of these obligations. One-way Guarantees Comcast provides full and unconditional guarantees of certain debt issued by Sky and other consolidated subsidiaries not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC. Comcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $185 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast’s obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast’s senior indebtedness, including debt issued or debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis. Comcast’s obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively, and as of March 31, 2020 has approximately $0.5 billion of notes receivable from a subsidiary of Comcast and $0.3 billion of other assets. 33 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 8 for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements. ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We have evaluated the information required under this item that was disclosed in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and there have been no significant changes to this information. ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusions regarding disclosure controls and procedures Our principal executive and principal financial officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report, have concluded that, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 34 Table of Contents PART II: OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS See Note 12 included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of legal proceedings. ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a discussion of our risk factors. The information presented below updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the risk factors and information disclosed in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as presented below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. The impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread are affecting our businesses in a number of ways. For example, we have temporarily closed all of our theme parks and we cannot currently predict when the parks will reopen, or their operating levels after they reopen. The creation and availability of our film and television programming in the United States and globally have been and will continue to be disrupted, including as a result of the postponement or cancellation of sporting events (such as the professional soccer, hockey, baseball and basketball leagues and the Olympics), theatrical closures and the suspension of entertainment content production. Our Cable Communications results, while strong in the first quarter of 2020, will be negatively affected in the second quarter by the significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions in recent weeks and by the costs associated with our support of customer connectivity as the population increasingly works and learns remotely from home. We expect th e continued deterioration of global economic conditions will result in lower advertising revenues and consumer spending across our businesses. We expect that the ultimate significance of the impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will vary but will generally depend on the extent of measures taken affecting day-to-day life and the length of time that such measures remain in place to respond to COVID-19. At this point, it is impossible to predict such extent and duration and the degree to which supply and demand for our products and services, including advertising, will be affected. This uncertainty makes it challenging for management to estimate with precision the future performance of our businesses However, we expect these impacts of COVID-19 to increase in significance in the second quarter of 2020, and to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term. COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in ‘‘Risk Factors’’ set forth in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Comcast owns all of the common equity interests in NBCUniversal, and NBCUniversal meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction H(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-Q and is therefore filing its information within this Form 10-Q with the reduced disclosure format. Each of Comcast and NBCUniversal is filing on its own behalf the information contained in this report that relates to itself, and neither company makes any representation as to information relating to the other company. Where information or an explanation is provided that is substantially the same for each company, such information or explanation has been combined in this report. Where information or an explanation is not substantially the same for each company, separate information and explanation has been provided. In addition, separate condensed consolidated financial statements for each company, along with notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, are included in this report. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, including NBCUniversal and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal, LLC as “NBCUniversal Holdings;” NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. as “NBCUniversal Enterprise;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 . This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should carefully review the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and particularly consider any risk factors set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called “forward-looking statements” by words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks outlined below and in other reports we file with the SEC. Actual events or our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ and Sky’s video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of NBCUniversal’s programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable regulation, the loss of Sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • the loss of Sky’s wholesale distribution agreements with traditional multichannel video providers could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • we rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions, including our acquisition of Sky, and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART

Contents Comcast Corporation NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Business and Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired a 100 % interest in Sky through a series of transactions, for total cash consideration of £ 30.2 billion (approximately $ 39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). See Note 6 for additional information on the transaction. Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior year periods to conform to classifications used in 2019 . See Note 7 for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in six reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Our Cable Communications segment consists of the operations of Comcast Cable, which is one of the nation’s largest providers of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services (“cable services”) to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations and various digital properties. Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Filmed Entertainment segment consists primarily of the operations of Universal Pictures, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide; our films are also produced under the Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, we are developing a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China. Our Sky segment consists of the operations of Sky, one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, Comcast Cable’s wireless phone service and certain other Cable-related business development initiatives are now presented in the Cable Communications segment. Results were previously presented in Corporate and Other. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2018 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in the Sky segment. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 14,584 $ 5,801 $ 1,967 $ 1,814 $ 336 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 2,771 955 184 9 4 Broadcast Television 2,230 338 36 36 3 Filmed Entertainment 1,706 195 21 5 5 Theme Parks 1,631 731 182 400 8 Headquarters and Other (a) 21 ( 130 ) 114 55 43 Eliminations (b) ( 64 ) 2 — — — NBCUniversal 8,295 2,091 537 505 63 Sky 4,554 899 644 104 188 Corporate and Other (c) 42 ( 237 ) 32 88 21 Eliminations (b) ( 648 ) ( 1 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 26,827 $ 8,553 $ 3,180 $ 2,511 $ 608 Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 14,023 $ 5,434 $ 2,077 $ 1,945 $ 367 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 2,850 959 180 11 6 Broadcast Television 2,452 321 32 37 — Filmed Entertainment 1,819 214 26 9 6 Theme Parks 1,528 725 170 269 23 Headquarters and Other (a) 15 ( 161 ) 106 79 43 Eliminations (b) ( 68 ) ( 1 ) — — — NBCUniversal 8,596 2,057 514 405 78 Corporate and Other (c) 73 ( 188 ) 27 34 — Eliminations (b) ( 557 ) 10 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 22,135 $ 7,313 $ 2,618 $ 2,384 $ 445 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 43,314 $ 17,383 $ 6,038 $ 4,771 $ 962 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 8,586 3,418 549 21 10 Broadcast Television 7,099 1,259 115 86 9 Filmed Entertainment 4,931 742 60 13 16 Theme Parks 4,371 1,819 514 1,172 44 Headquarters and Other (a) 60 ( 486 ) 341 139 120 Eliminations (b) ( 233 ) — — — — NBCUniversal 24,814 6,752 1,579 1,431 199 Sky 14,179 2,334 2,058 540 491 Corporate and Other (c) 206 ( 637 ) 101 124 34 Eliminations (b) ( 1,969 ) ( 10 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 80,544 $ 25,822 $ 9,776 $ 6,866 $ 1,686 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 41,638 $ 16,100 $ 6,161 $ 5,403 $ 998 NBCUniversal Cable Networks (e) 8,881 3,389 548 22 15 Broadcast Television (e) 8,340 1,245 106 99 75 Filmed Entertainment 5,176 555 117 24 20 Theme Parks 4,170 1,789 492 811 158 Headquarters and Other (a) 44 ( 497 ) 314 179 106 Eliminations (b)(e) ( 245 ) ( 3 ) — — — NBCUniversal 26,366 6,478 1,577 1,135 374 Corporate and Other (c) 412 ( 566 ) 82 69 3 Eliminations (b)(e) ( 1,755 ) ( 38 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 66,661 $ 21,974 $ 7,820 $ 6,607 $ 1,375 (a) NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. (b) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. The most common types of transactions are the following: • our Cable Networks segment generates revenue by selling programming to our Cable Communications segment, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue elimination amount • our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements with our Cable Communications segment • our Cable Communications segment generates revenue by selling advertising and by selling the use of satellite feeds to our Cable Networks segment • our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by selling advertising to our Cable Communications segment • our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by licensing content to our Cable Networks segment; for segment reporting, this revenue is recognized as the programming rights asset for the licensed content is amortized based on third party revenue • our Filmed Entertainment, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by licensing content to our Sky segment (c) Corporate and Other activities include costs associated with overhead and personnel, revenue and expenses associated with the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, such as the development of Peacock, NBCUniversal’s direct-to-consumer streaming service. (d) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.

Our potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our stock options and our restricted share units (“RSUs”). Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in which the combination of the option exercise price and the associated unrecognized compensation expense is greater than the average market price of our common stock. The amount of potential common shares related to our share-based compensation plans that were excluded from diluted EPS because their effect would have been antidilutive was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 or 2018 . Note 5: Long-Term Debt As of September 30, 2019 , our debt had a carrying value of $ 100.9 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 114.1 billion . The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market values for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Debt Borrowings and Repayments For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we had borrowings of $ 516 million primarily related to the Universal Beijing Resort term loans . For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we made repayments of $ 10.0 billion , including the early redemptions of $ 3.4 billion of senior notes due 2020 and the partial repayment of a term loan, both of which were funded using proceeds from our collateralized obligation (see Note 9). Guarantee Structure Comcast, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal fully and unconditionally guarantee each other’s debt securities, including the Comcast revolving credit facility . As of September 30, 2019 , the principal amount of debt securities outstanding within the cross-guarantee structure totaled $ 86.4 billion . Comcast and Comcast Cable fully and unconditionally guarantee NBCUniversal Enterprise’s debt securities, including its revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2019 , the principal amount of debt securities guaranteed by Comcast and Comcast Cable totaled $ 1.5 billion . NBCUniversal does not guarantee NBCUniversal Enterprise’s debt securities. Comcast fully and unconditionally guarantees Universal Studios Japan’s yen-denominated ¥ 379 billion (approximately $ 3.5 billion using exchange rates as of September 30, 2019 ) term loans with a final maturity of March 2022. None of Comcast, Comcast Cable nor NBCUniversal guarantee the ¥ 7.4 billion RMB (approximately $ 1.0 billion using exchange rates as of September 30, 2019 ) principal amount of Universal Beijing Resort term loans outstanding. In May 2019, Comcast provided a full and unconditional guarantee of Sky’s debt (approximately $ 9.0 billion using exchange rates as of September 30, 2019 ) in connection with Sky’s noteholders consenting to (i) the transfer of the listing of three series of notes from the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange to the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange and (ii) amending certain terms of the Sky notes. 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 6: Significant Transactions Sky Transaction On October 9, 2018, in connection with our offer to acquire the share capital of Sky, we acquired a controlling interest in Sky through a series of purchases of Sky shares at our offer price of £ 17.28 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining Sky shares and now own 100 % of Sky’s equity interests. Total cash consideration was £ 30.2 billion (approximately $ 39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). We financed the acquisition through a combination of new fixed and floating rate notes, issuance of term loans and cash on hand. Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Allocation of Purchase Price We have applied acquisition accounting to Sky. Sky’s results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date and are reported in our Sky segment. The net assets of Sky were recorded at their estimated fair value using primarily Level 3 inputs. In valuing acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates are based on, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations and appropriate discount rates. During the first quarter of 2019, we revised our estimates of fair value, primarily related to intangible assets, property and equipment, and investments (included below in other noncurrent assets and (liabilities), net), and recorded corresponding adjustments to deferred taxes. We also recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately $ 1.2 billion associated with our assessment of the realization of Sky’s deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating losses. These changes resulted in an increase in goodwill of approximately $ 1.4 billion and an adjustment in the first quarter of 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that resulted in an increase to depreciation and amortization expense of $ 53 million . The table below presents the allocation of the all-cash purchase price of £ 30.2 billion , or $ 39.4 billion , to the assets and liabilities of Sky as a result of the transaction. Allocation of Purchase Price (in millions) Consideration transferred $ 39,387 Allocation of purchase price Cash $ 1,283 Accounts receivable and other current assets 2,359 Film and television costs 2,512 Property and equipment 4,127 Intangible assets 19,539 Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities ( 5,885 ) Long-term debt ( 11,468 ) Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net ( 2,974 ) Other noncurrent assets and (liabilities), net ( 1,398 ) Fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 8,095 Goodwill $ 31,292 Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes customer premise equipment with a carrying value of $ 1.4 billion , which have original estimated useful lives of 5 to 7 years . The remaining property and equipment includes network assets, real estate, and other machinery and equipment. Intangible Assets Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships with a carrying amount of $ 9.5 billion and developed technology and software with a carrying amount of $ 4.3 billion , with original estimated useful lives between 6 and 19 years and 4 and 9 years , respectively. Indefinite-lived assets consist of trade names with a carrying amount of $ 5.8 billion . 12 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Goodwill Goodwill consists primarily of intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint, assembled workforce, noncontractual relationships and agreements. The acquired goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-Related Costs As a result of the Sky transaction, we incurred expenses in 2018 related to legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services, which are reflected in other operating and administrative expenses. We also incurred certain financing costs associated with our borrowings, which are reflected in interest expense. The table below presents the amounts related to these expenses included in our condensed consolidated statement of income. (in millions) Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Other operating and administrative expenses $ 8 $ 29 Interest expense $ 34 $ 45 Unaudited Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma information has been presented as if the Sky transaction occurred on January 1, 2017. This information is based on historical results of operations, adjusted for allocation of purchase price and other acquisition accounting adjustments, and is not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the business since January 1, 2017. For pro forma purposes, 2018 earnings were adjusted to exclude the acquisition-related costs. No pro forma adjustments have been made for cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. (in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Revenue $ 26,824 $ 81,239 Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 3,448 $ 9,388 Basic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.75 $ 2.04 Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.74 $ 2.01 Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain financial and operating covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of ¥ 26.6 billion RMB (approximately $ 4 billion ). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of September 30, 2019 , Universal Beijing Resort had $ 1 billion principal amount of term loans outstanding under the debt financing agreements. We have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a variable interest entity based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30 % interest. Universal Beijing Resort’s results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the “construction of Universal Beijing Resort” and “proceeds from borrowings” captions, respectively, and equity contributions from our investing partner are included in other financing activities. In March 2018, Universal Beijing Resort received initial equity investments through a combination of cash and noncash contributions from the investors. As of September 30, 2019 , our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loans, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 2.4 billion and $ 1.7 billion , respectively. 13 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 7: Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The most significant change in the updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all operating leases with the exception of short-term leases. The standard also expands the disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease did not significantly change from previous guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted to reflect the impacts of the updated guidance. In addition, as permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, prior scoping and classification conclusions were carried forward for leases existing as of the adoption date. Upon adoption, we recorded $ 4.2 billion and $ 4.8 billion for operating lease assets and liabilities, respectively, which includes the impact of fair value adjustments, prepaid and deferred rent and lease incentives. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not significantly impact our recognition of finance leases, which were previously described as capital leases. As of the date of adoption, our liabilities for finance leases were $ 787 million , including $ 229 million of additional contracts determined to be leases in connection with the Sky transaction , which were recorded in long-term debt, and the related assets were recorded in property and equipment, net. Our finance leases were not considered material for further disclosure. The adoption of the new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 12 for further information. Film and Television Costs In March 2019, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The updated guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs, and requires impairment testing to be performed at a group level for capitalized film and television costs when the content is predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we recognized losses of $ 262 million and income of $ 6 million , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 , we recognized income of $ 38 million and $ 224 million , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , we made cash capital contributions totaling $ 475 million and $ 133 million , respectively, to Atairos. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 3.2 billion and $ 2.7 billion , respectively. In April 2018, we sold a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses to Atairos and received as consideration additional equity interests in Atairos. In connection with the sale of the businesses, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 200 million in other operating gains. Hulu and Collateralized Obligation In May 2019, we entered into a series of agreements (the “Hulu Transaction”) with The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries (“Disney”), whereby we relinquished our board seats and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, LLC (“Hulu”), and Disney assumed full operational control. We also acquired our proportionate share of the approximate 10 % interest in Hulu previously held by AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) for approximately $ 477 million , increasing our ownership interest to approximately 33 % from approximately 30 % . Following the Hulu Transaction, future capital calls are limited to $ 1.5 billion in the aggregate each year, with any excess funding requirements funded with member loans. We have the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of these capital calls, and if we elect not to fund our share of future equity capital calls, our ownership interest will be diluted, subject to an ownership floor of 21 % . The Hulu Transaction agreements include put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we can require Disney to buy, and Disney can require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $ 27.5 billion for 100 % of the equity of Hulu. The minimum total equity value and ownership floor guarantee minimum proceeds of approximately $ 5.8 billion upon exercise of the put or call. In connection with the Hulu Transaction, we agreed to extend certain licenses of NBCUniversal content until late 2024. We can terminate most of our content license agreements with Hulu beginning in 2022, and beginning in 2020, we have the right to modify certain content licenses that are currently exclusive to Hulu, so that we can exhibit the content on our platforms in return for reducing the license fee. 15 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation In August 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024. The principal amount of the term loan is secured by the proceeds guaranteed by Disney under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. The proceeds from the put/call provisions are available only for the repayment of the term loan and are not available to us unless and until the bank lenders are fully paid under the term loan provisions. The bank lenders have no rights to proceeds from the put/call provisions in excess of amounts owed under the term loan. As a result of this transaction, we now present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation”, respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. As of September 30, 2019 , our collateralized obligation had a carrying value of $ 5.2 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 5.2 billion . The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We account for our investment using the equity method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we recognized losses of $ 101 million and $ 351 million , respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 , we recognized losses of $ 132 million and $ 370 million , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , we made cash capital contributions totaling $ 903 million , inclusive of the funding for the acquisition of the AT&T interest, and $ 341 million , respectively, to Hulu. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 816 million and $ 248 million , respectively. In August 2016, Time Warner Inc., which was acquired by AT&T in 2018, acquired a 10 % interest in Hulu, diluting our interest at that time from approximately 33 % to approximately 30 % . Given the contingent nature of put and call options related to that interest, we recorded a deferred gain as a result of the dilution. In the first quarter of 2019, the put and call options expired unexercised and we recognized the previously deferred gain of $ 159 million in other income (loss), net. The Weather Channel In March 2018, we sold our investment in The Weather Channel cable network and recognized a pretax gain of $ 64 million in other income (loss), net. Marketable Equity Securities Snap For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we recognized unrealized gains of $ 45 million and $ 303 million , respectively, in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 , we recognized unrealized losses of $ 135 million and $ 180 million , respectively. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 465 million and $ 162 million , respectively. Peloton In September 2019, as a result of Peloton’s initial public offering, we recognized unrealized gains of $ 150 million related to our investment in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. Following the initial public offering, we now present our investment in marketable equity securities, which was previously presented in non-marketable equity securities. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 260 million and $ 110 million , respectively. Other Investments AirTouch We hold two series of preferred stock of Verizon Americas, Inc., formerly known as AirTouch Communications, Inc. (“AirTouch”), a subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc., which are redeemable in April 2020. As of both September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment in AirTouch was $ 1.6 billion . We account for our investment in AirTouch as a held to maturity investment using the cost method. As of September 30, 2019 , the estimated fair value of the AirTouch preferred stock and the estimated fair value of the associated liability related to the redeemable subsidiary preferred shares issued by one of our consolidated subsidiaries were each $ 1.7 billion . The estimated fair values were based on Level 2 inputs that use pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 16 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 10: Goodwill NBCUniversal (in millions) Cable Communications Cable Networks Broadcast Television Filmed Entertainment Theme Parks Sky Corporate and Other Total Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 12,784 $ 13,407 $ 843 $ 3,184 $ 6,684 $ 29,250 $ 2 $ 66,154 Acquisitions 131 — 13 — — 10 — 154 Dispositions — — — — — ( 12 ) — ( 12 ) Adjustments (a) 2,166 490 199 138 — ( 1,555 ) 2 1,440 Foreign currency translation ( 116 ) ( 34 ) ( 11 ) ( 11 ) 106 ( 757 ) — ( 823 ) Balance, September 30, 2019 $ 14,965 $ 13,863 $ 1,044 $ 3,311 $ 6,790 $ 26,936 $ 4 $ 66,913 (a) Adjustments during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily included 1) measurement period adjustments resulting from finalization of acquisition accounting for Sky and 2) the final assignment of goodwill resulting from the Sky transaction to our reporting units. We performed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 1, 2019 and no impairment charge was required. Note 11: Supplemental Financial Information Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation plans consist primarily of awards of RSUs and stock options to certain employees and directors as part of our approach to long-term incentive compensation. Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. In March 2019 , we granted 12.4 million RSUs and 41.9 million stock options related to our annual management awards. The weighted-average fair values associated with these grants were $ 39.88 per RSU and $ 7.91 per stock option.

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally utilize our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The lease asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are not recorded for leases with an initial term of one year or less. Lease expense for operating leases recorded in the balance sheet is included in operating costs and expenses and is based on the future minimum lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease plus any variable lease costs. Operating lease expenses, inclusive of short-term and variable lease expenses, recognized in our condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $ 268 million and $ 806 million , respectively. These amounts do not include lease costs associated with production activities or other amounts capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, which are not material.

The estimated fair value is based on Level 2 inputs that use pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Contingencies We are a defendant in several lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of our businesses. In certain of these cases, other industry participants are also defendants, and also in certain of these cases, we expect that any potential liability would be in part or in whole the responsibility of our equipment and technology vendors under applicable contractual indemnification provisions. In addition, we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation. 19 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 13: Condensed Consolidating Financial Information Comcast (“Comcast Parent”), Comcast Cable Communications, LLC (“CCCL Parent”) and NBCUniversal (“NBCUniversal Media Parent”) have fully and unconditionally guaranteed each other’s debt.

with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. On October 9, 2018, in connection with our offer to acquire the share capital of Sky, we acquired a controlling interest in Sky through a series of purchases of Sky shares at our offer price of £17.28 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining Sky shares and now own 100% of Sky’s equity interests. Total cash consideration was £30.2 billion (approximately $39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). We financed the acquisition through a combination of new fixed and floating rate notes, issuance of term loans and cash on hand. Cable Communications Segment Comcast Cable is one of the nation’s largest providers of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services (“cable services”) to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. As of September 30, 2019 , our cable systems had 31.2 million total customer relationships, including 28.8 million residential and 2.4 million business customer relationships, and passed approximately 59 million homes and businesses. Our Cable Communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our cable services, which we market individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. NBCUniversal Segments NBCUniversal is one of the world’s leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks worldwide . Cable Networks Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of a diversified portfolio of cable television networks. Our cable networks are comprised of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations; and our various digital properties. Our Cable Networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers; from the sale of advertising on our cable networks and digital properties; from the licensing of our owned programming, including programming from our cable television studio production operations, to cable and broadcast networks and subscription video on demand services; and from the sale of our owned programming on standard-definition digital video discs and Blu-ray discs (together, “DVDs”) and through digital distribution services such as iTunes. Broadcast Television Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and our various digital properties. Our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue primarily from the sale of advertising on our broadcast networks, owned local broadcast television stations and digital properties; from the licensing of our owned programming by our broadcast television studio production operations to various distribution platforms, including to cable and broadcast networks as well as to subscription video on demand services; from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated local broadcast television stations; and from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenue primarily from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, from the licensing of produced and acquired films through various distribution platforms, and from the sale of produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Our Filmed Entertainment segment also generates revenue from Fandango, a movie ticketing and entertainment business, the sale of consumer products, the production and licensing of live stage plays, and the distribution of filmed entertainment produced by third parties. 28 Table of Contents Theme Parks Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, and an additional theme park in Orlando, Florida. Our Theme Parks segment generates revenue primarily from ticket sales and guest spending at our Universal theme parks. Sky Segment Our Sky segment consists of the operations of Sky, one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. As of September 30, 2019 , Sky had 23.9 million retail customer relationships. Corporate and Other Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We are also pursuing other business initiatives, such as the development of Peacock, NBCUniversal’s direct-to-consumer streaming service. Competition The results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation, which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of NBCUniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television programming and Sky’s owned television channels. For additional information on the competition our businesses face, see our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and refer to Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the “Competition” discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled “Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “Changes in consumer behavior driven by online distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.” Seasonality and Cyclicality Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. In our Cable Communications segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year. In our Sky segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving direct-to-home (“DTH”) and over the top (“OTT”) video services, including the start of the new soccer seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of each year due to higher marketing expenses. Revenue in our Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Sky segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is also cyclical, with a benefit in even-numbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising. Revenue in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. The results of Sky’s advertising business are subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. This includes seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup ™ . The results for Sky’s content business are also subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in timing, nature and quantity of original programming distributed to other markets. Our revenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains) are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, which affect our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments, and the Super Bowl, which affects our Broadcast Television segment. In particular, our advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time and our distribution 29 Table of Contents revenue increases in the period of these broadcasts. Our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees. Revenue in our Filmed Entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. Content licensing revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees. Revenue in our Theme Parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the holiday season. Exclusive tier one sports rights, such as local European and UEFA Champions League soccer, Formula 1, and English cricket, play a key role within Sky’s wider content strategy. In Europe broadcasting rights for tier one sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality for Sky, although the staggered timing of tier one sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market.

Sky’s results of operations are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements following the October 9, 2018 acquisition date. Consolidated Revenue Consolidated revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of Sky. Our Cable Communications and Theme Parks segments accounted for the remaining increase in consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , which was partially offset by decreases in revenue in our Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Cable Networks segments. Consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 included revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and the 2018 Super Bowl in February 2018.

Operating costs and expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Operating costs and expenses for our corporate operations, businesses development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Corporate and Other Results of Operations.” Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Increase/ (Decrease) Nine Months Ended September 30 Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2019 2018 % 2019 2018 % Cable Communications $ 1,967 $ 2,077 (5.3 )% $ 6,038 $ 6,161 (2.0 )% NBCUniversal 537 514 4.3 1,579 1,577 — Sky 644 — NM 2,058 — NM Corporate and Other 32 27 18.6 101 82 26.0 Total $ 3,180 $ 2,618 21.4 % $ 9,776 $ 7,820 25.0 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense related to Sky. During the first quarter of 2019, we recorded adjustments to the purchase price allocation of Sky, primarily related to intangible assets and property and equipment. This change resulted in an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that increased depreciation and amortization expense by $53 million . Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $486 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $198 million and $639 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 , respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011 (see Note 6 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Sky transaction). Consolidated Other Operating Gains Consolidated other operating gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 included $141 million related to the sale of a business in our Filmed Entertainment segment. The nine months ended September 30, 2018 also included $200 million related to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in Corporate and Other (see Note 9 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements). 31 Table of Contents Consolidated Interest Expense Consolidated interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increases in our debt outstanding associated with the financing of and debt assumed in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as a $56 million charge recorded in the third quarter of 2019 related to the early redemption of debt. Consolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ (355 ) $ (76 ) $ (295 ) $ (56 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 174 (38 ) 582 (50 ) Other income (loss), net 71 3 224 198 Total $ (110 ) $ (111 ) $ 511 $ 92 Equity in Net Income (Losses) of Investees, Net The changes in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 were primarily related to our equity method investments in Atairos and Hulu. The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments. The losses at Hulu were primarily due to programming, advertising and marketing costs, and higher other administrative expenses. The equity in net income (losses) of Atairos and Hulu for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 are presented in the table below. Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Atairos $ (262 ) $ 38 $ 6 $ 224 Hulu $ (101 ) $ (132 ) $ (351 ) $ (370 ) Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities, Net The realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to unrealized gains of $45 million and $303 million , respectively, related to our investment in Snap, and a $150 million gain related to our investment in Peloton as a result of its initial public offering in the third quarter of 2019. Other Income (Loss), Net Other income (loss), net included $219 million of gains recorded in the first and third quarters of 2019 related to the dilution of our Hulu ownership and $90 million of losses due to equity method investment impairments in the second and third quarters of 2019. Other income (loss), net included a $64 million gain related to the sale of our investment in the Weather Channel cable network in the first quarter of 2018. See Note 9 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 8 to NBCUniversal’s condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The decrease in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 was primarily due to state and federal tax law changes that were enacted in 2018 resulting in $148 million of higher income tax expense in the third quarter of 2018 and $125 million of benefits related to state income tax adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher taxable income from operations. We also recognized an income tax benefit of $128 million during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of federal tax legislation in 2018. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 to both Comcast’s and NBCUniversal’s condensed consolidated financial statements for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes. 32 Table of Contents Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, Comcast Cable’s wireless phone service and certain other Cable-related business development initiatives are now presented in the Cable Communications segment. Results were previously presented in Corporate and Other. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2018 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in the Sky segment.

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our cable services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) advanced services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of September 30, 2019 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 184,000 and 6,000 , respectively. Wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $156.72 and $156.29 , respectively. Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $155.84 and $155.49 , respectively. This metric is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our high-speed internet, video, voice and wireless services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was $62.34 and $62.72 , respectively. Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $60.39 and $60.13 , respectively. Each of our cable services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services. 34 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment – Revenue High-Speed Internet High-speed internet revenue increased 9.3% and 9.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 . Increases in the number of residential customers receiving our high-speed internet services accounted for increases in revenue of 4.9% and 5.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively. The remaining increases in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were primarily due to increases in average rates. Video Video revenue was flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to declines in the number of residential video customers, partially offset by increases in average rates. We have experienced, and expect that we will continue to experience, declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures, and we expect that our video revenue will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs, such as promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments. Voice Voice revenue decreased 1.9% and 1.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to declines in the number of residential voice customers. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Wireless revenue increased 38.1% and 27.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increases in the number of customer lines. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , while the number of customer lines increased, the sales of handsets declined due to customers electing to bring their own device. Business Services Business services revenue increased 9.3% and 9.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 . The increases were primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving our services and increases in average rates. Advertising Advertising revenue decreased 11.9% and 8.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to decreases in political advertising revenue. Excluding the impact of political advertising revenue, advertising revenue increased 1.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and decreased 1.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , compared to the same periods in 2018 . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , 8% and 6% of our Cable Communications segment advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments, respectively. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 , 4% of our Cable Communications segment advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Other Other revenue increased 13.4% and 8.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increases from the timing of revenue from the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers and from our security and automation services. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses were flat for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming fees, offset by declines in the number of video subscribers. Programming expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming fees, partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers. We anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase, which may be at rates higher than those experienced recently, due to the timing of contract renewals in the future. 35 Table of Contents Technical and product support expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . The increases were primarily due to expenses related to the continued development, deployment and support of our products and services, expenses related to the continued growth in business services and increased costs associated with our wireless phone service. The increases in wireless phone service costs were primarily due to increases in the number of lines. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, while customer lines increased, the costs of handsets sold decreased due to customers electing to bring their own device, which partially offset an increase in variable network fees. Customer service expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to lower personnel costs. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increases in spending associated with attracting new customers. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 was partially offset by the absence of advertising expenses associated with the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics. Franchise and other regulatory fees increased for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in the related rates of these fees, partially offset by a decrease in the revenue to which the fees apply. Franchise and other regulatory fees were flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . Other operating costs and expenses were flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our Cable Communications segment operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. The most significant operating costs and expenses for our Cable Communications segment are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers. Our Cable Communications segment operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 was 39.8% and 40.1% , respectively. Our Cable Communications segment operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 was 38.8% and 38.7% , respectively. We continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, particularly residential high-speed internet and business services, and on improving losses related to our wireless phone service and overall operating cost management. Losses from our wireless phone service were $94 million and $285 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to losses of $178 million and $552 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 , respectively.

The decrease in content licensing and other revenue was due to the timing of content provided under our licensing agreements. The increase in distribution revenue was primarily due to increases in the contractual rates charged under distribution agreements and the timing of contract renewals, which were partially offset by increased declines in the number of subscribers at our cable networks. Advertising revenue was flat compared to the same period in 2018 due to higher prices for advertising units sold, which were offset by audience ratings declines at our networks. Cable Networks revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to decreases in advertising revenue, content licensing and other revenue, and distribution revenue. The decrease in advertising and distribution revenue was due to the absence of revenue resulting from our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics. Excluding $378 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, Cable Networks revenue increased by 1.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 .

Excluding $236 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, distribution revenue increased primarily due to increases in contractual rates charged under distribution agreements and the timing of contract renewals, partially offset by increased declines in the number of subscribers at our cable networks during the quarter. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , 16% and 15% , respectively, of our Cable Networks segment revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, 15% of our Cable Networks segment revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Cable Networks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to decreases in programming and production costs, and advertising, marketing and promotion costs, partially offset by an increase in other operating and administrative costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was primarily due to decreases in studio production costs. The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion costs was primarily due to lower spending on marketing related to our cable networks programming and our digital properties. The increase in other operating and administrative costs was primarily due to employee-related costs. Operating costs and expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to decreases in programming and production costs, and advertising, marketing and promotion costs, partially offset by an increase in other operating and administrative costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was primarily due to the absence of costs associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics. The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion costs was due to lower spending on marketing related to our cable networks programming and our digital properties.

The decrease in home entertainment revenue was primarily due to higher sales of 2018 releases, including Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, compared to the sales of 2019 releases, including Secret Life of Pets 2. The decrease in theatrical revenue was primarily due to the strength and volume of releases in the prior year period, including Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again , which were partially offset by releases in our 2019 film slate, including Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw . The increase in content licensing revenue was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements. Filmed Entertainment revenue decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to decreases in theatrical, home entertainment, and other revenue, which were partially offset by an increase in content licensing revenue. The decrease in theatrical revenue was due to the strong performances of several releases in our 2018 film slate, including Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again , which were partially offset by releases in our 2019 film slate, including Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, and Secret Life of Pets 2. The decrease in home entertainment revenue was primarily due to higher sales of 2018 releases, including Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, compared to the sales of 2019 releases, including How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, Dr. Seuss ’ The Grinch, and Secret Life of Pets 2. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to the absence of revenue associated with the sale of a business in 2018. The increase in content licensing revenue was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements. Filmed Entertainment Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to decreases in advertising, marketing and promotion costs and programming and production costs. The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion costs was due to higher spending on the marketing of prior period releases. The decrease in programming and production costs was primarily due to higher amortization of film production costs in the prior year period.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency, content revenue increased 15.4% and 26.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 , reflecting the monetization of our slate of original programming and the wholesaling of sports programming, including exclusive sports rights recently acquired in Italy and Germany.

Corporate and Other – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the costs of other business initiatives, such as the development of Peacock, NBCUniversal’s direct-to-consumer streaming service, and operating costs and expenses associated with Comcast Spectacor. Operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to transaction-related costs of $33 million directly related to the Sky transaction, including expenses resulting from the replacement of share-based compensation awards and costs related to integration activities, as well as costs associated with the development of Peacock. Operating costs and expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to transaction-related costs of $168 million directly related to the Sky transaction, including expenses resulting from the replacement of share-based compensation awards and costs related to integration activities, which were partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in the second quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA excludes transaction-related costs directly related to the Sky transaction. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 44 Table of Contents We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from consolidated Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income, net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods.

Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, purchases of investments, cash paid for intangible assets and the construction of Universal Beijing Resort. Capital expenditures increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of spending at Sky and an increase in spending by our Theme Parks segment, partially offset by a decrease in spending by our Cable Communications segment due to lower spending on scalable infrastructure and customer premise equipment. Purchases of investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 consisted primarily of our cash capital contributions of $903 million to Hulu and $475 million to Atairos. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans, partially offset by proceeds from a collateralized obligation. In August 2019, we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility, which is fully secured, primarily by the minimum guaranteed proceeds from Disney under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. The proceeds from the collateralized obligation were used to redeem $3.4 billion of 5.15% senior notes due 2020 , and to repay $906 million of our sterling-denominated term loan and our outstanding commercial paper. See Note 9 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 8 to NBCUniversal’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repayments of our term loans and repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Notes 5 and 6 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements and Notes 4 and 5 to NBCUniversal’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financing activities, including details of our debt repayments and borrowings. Available Borrowings Under Credit Facilities We also maintain significant availability under our commercial paper programs and revolving credit facilities to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. 46 Table of Contents Commercial Paper Programs For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we made net repayments of $673 million under our commercial paper programs.

As of September 30, 2019 , there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. Amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion . Share Repurchases and Dividends Effective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $12 billion , which does not have an expiration date. Under the authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We have paused our share repurchase program for 2019 in order to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky and no common stock share repurchases were made under this authorization for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 . We paid $431 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2019 , our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.84 per share on an annualized basis. In July 2019 , our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.21 per share to be paid in October 2019 . We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. On July 24, 2019, we paid dividends totaling $955 million . Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We performed our annual impairment testing of our cable franchise rights as of July 1, 2019 and no impairment charge was required. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Presentation Unless indicated otherwise, throughout these notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we refer to NBCUniversal and its consolidated subsidiaries as “we,” “us” and “our.” We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. See Note 6 for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in four reportable business segments: Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations and various digital properties. Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Filmed Entertainment segment consists primarily of the operations of Universal Pictures, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide; our films are also produced under the Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, we are developing a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to NBCUniversal excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, 2018 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in Headquarters and Other. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below.

(c) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to NBCUniversal before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.

The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market values for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Debt Borrowings and Repayments For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we had borrowings of $ 572 million primarily related to the Universal Beijing Resort term loans . For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we made repayments of $ 2.7 billion including the early redemptions of $ 2.0 billion of senior notes due 2020 and $ 610 million of notes due 2049 to Comcast. The early redemptions were funded using proceeds from our collateralized obligation (see Note 8) and were accounted for as debt extinguishments, resulting in a charge of $ 213 million to interest expense in the third quarter of 2019, of which $ 178 million related to the notes due to Comcast. Guarantee Structure We, Comcast and a 100 % owned cable holding company subsidiary of Comcast (“CCCL Parent”) fully and unconditionally guarantee each other’s debt securities, including the $ 7.6 billion Comcast revolving credit facility due 2022. As of September 30, 2019 , $ 80.6 billion principal amount of outstanding debt securities of Comcast and CCCL Parent were subject to the cross-guarantee structure . We do not, however, guarantee the obligations of NBCUniversal Enterprise with respect to its $ 1.5 billion outstanding debt securities, including its senior notes, revolving credit facility, commercial paper program nor its $ 725 million liquidation preference of Series A cumulative preferred stock. The Universal Studios Japan term loans are not subject to the cross-guarantee structure, however they have a separate guarantee from Comcast. The Universal Beijing Resort term loans are not guaranteed. Note 5: Significant Transactions Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain financial and operating covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of ¥ 26.6 billion RMB (approximately $ 4 billion ). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of September 30, 2019 , Universal Beijing Resort had $ 1 billion principal amount of term loans outstanding under the debt financing agreements. We have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a variable interest entity based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30 % interest. Universal Beijing Resort’s results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the “construction of Universal Beijing Resort” and “proceeds from borrowings” captions, respectively, and equity contributions from our investing partner are included in other financing activities. In March 2018, Universal Beijing Resort received initial equity investments through a combination of cash and noncash contributions from the investors. As of September 30, 2019 , our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loans, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 2.4 billion and $ 1.7 billion , respectively. Note 6: Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The most significant change in the updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all operating leases with the exception of short-term leases. The standard also expands the disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of 60 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC expenses and cash flows arising from a lease did not significantly change from previous guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted to reflect the impacts of the updated guidance. In addition, as permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, prior scoping and classification conclusions were carried forward for leases existing as of the adoption date. Upon adoption, we recorded approximately $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.8 billion of operating lease assets and liabilities, respectively, which includes the impact of fair value adjustments, prepaid rent and lease incentives. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not impact our recognition of finance leases, which were previously described as capital leases. As of the date of adoption, our liabilities for finance leases were $ 332 million , which were recorded in long-term debt, and the related assets were recorded in property and equipment, net. Our finance leases were not considered material for further disclosure. The adoption of the new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 9 for further information. Film and Television Costs In March 2019, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The updated guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs, and requires impairment testing to be performed at a group level for capitalized film and television costs when the content is predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

We also acquired our proportionate share of the approximate 10 % interest in Hulu previously held by AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) for approximately $ 477 million , increasing our ownership interest to approximately 33 % from approximately 30 % . Following the Hulu Transaction, future capital calls are limited to $ 1.5 billion in the aggregate each year, with any excess funding requirements funded with member loans. We have the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of these capital calls, and if we elect not to fund our share of future equity capital calls, our ownership interest will be diluted, subject to an ownership floor of 21 % . The Hulu Transaction agreements include put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we can require Disney to buy, and Disney can require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $ 27.5 billion for 100 % of the equity of Hulu. The minimum total equity value and ownership floor guarantee minimum proceeds of approximately $ 5.8 billion upon exercise of the put or call. In connection with the Hulu Transaction, we agreed to extend certain licenses of NBCUniversal content until late 2024. We can terminate most of our content license agreements with Hulu beginning in 2022, and beginning in 2020, we have the right to modify certain content licenses that are currently exclusive to Hulu, so that we can exhibit the content on our platforms in return for reducing the license fee. In August 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $ 5.2 billion under a term loan facility due March 2024. The principal amount of the term loan is secured by the proceeds guaranteed by Disney under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. The proceeds from the put/call provisions are available only for the repayment of the term loan and are not available to us unless and until the bank lenders are fully paid under the term loan provisions. The bank lenders have no rights to proceeds from the put/call provisions in excess of amounts owed under the term loan. As a result of this transaction, we now present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our condensed consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation”, respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. As of September 30, 2019 , our collateralized obligation had a carrying value of $ 5.2 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 5.2 billion . The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. We account for our investment using the equity method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we recognized losses of $ 101 million and $ 351 million , respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 , we recognized losses of $ 132 million and $ 370 million , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , we made cash capital contributions totaling $ 903 million , inclusive of the funding for the acquisition of the AT&T interest, and $ 341 million , respectively, to Hulu. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 816 million and $ 248 million , respectively. In August 2016, Time Warner Inc., which was acquired by AT&T in 2018, acquired a 10 % interest in Hulu, diluting our interest at that time from approximately 33 % to approximately 30 % . Given the contingent nature of put and call options related to that interest, we recorded a deferred gain as a result of the dilution. In the first quarter of 2019, the put and call options expired unexercised and we recognized the previously deferred gain of $ 159 million in other income (loss), net. The Weather Channel In March 2018, we sold our investment in The Weather Channel cable network and recognized a pretax gain of $ 64 million in other income (loss), net. 62 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC Marketable Equity Securities Snap For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , we recognized unrealized gains of $ 45 million and $ 303 million , respectively, in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 , we recognized unrealized losses of $ 135 million and $ 180 million , respectively. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 465 million and $ 162 million , respectively. Peloton In September 2019, as a result of Peloton’s initial public offering, we recognized unrealized gains of $ 150 million related to our investment in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net. Following the initial public offering, we now present our investment in marketable equity securities, which was previously presented in non-marketable equity securities. As of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 260 million and $ 110 million , respectively. Note 9: Supplemental Financial Information Leases Our leases consist primarily of real estate and equipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally utilize our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The lease asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are not recorded for leases with an initial term of one year or less. Lease expense for operating leases recorded in the balance sheet is included in operating costs and expenses and is based on the future minimum lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease plus any variable lease costs. Operating lease expenses, inclusive of short-term and variable lease expenses, recognized in our condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019 were $ 110 million and $ 331 million , respectively. These amounts do not include lease costs associated with production activities or other amounts capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, which are not material. The table below summarizes the operating lease assets and liabilities recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.

We generate revenue from Comcast primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming, the fees received under retransmission consent agreements in our Broadcast Television segment and, to a lesser extent, the sale of advertising and our owned programming, and we incur expenses primarily related to advertising and various support services provided by Comcast to us. 64 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC As part of the Comcast cash management process, we and Comcast have a revolving credit agreement with a maturity date of 2026 that allows us to borrow from Comcast and for Comcast to borrow from us up to $ 5 billion . Depending on the receivable or payable position, amounts owed by us to Comcast or to us by Comcast under the revolving credit agreements are presented under the captions “notes payable to Comcast” and “notes receivable from Comcast,” respectively, in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and are presented as current since the amounts include daily borrowings and repayments throughout the year based on our working capital needs. In the third quarter of 2019, using a portion of the proceeds from a collateralized obligation, we issued $ 1.3 billion of non-interest bearing notes due 2024 to Comcast, repaid $ 1.0 billion under our revolving credit agreement with Comcast, and repaid the $ 610 million 4.00 % notes due 2049 to Comcast. Comcast is also the counterparty to one of our contractual obligations. As of September 30, 2019 , the carrying value of the liability associated with this contractual obligation was $ 383 million .

Comcast owns all of the common equity interests in NBCUniversal, and NBCUniversal meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction H(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-Q and is therefore filing its information within this Form 10-Q with the reduced disclosure format. Each of Comcast and NBCUniversal is filing on its own behalf the information contained in this report that relates to itself, and neither company makes any representation as to information relating to the other company. Where information or an explanation is provided that is substantially the same for each company, such information or explanation has been combined in this report. Where information or an explanation is not substantially the same for each company, separate information and explanation has been provided. In addition, separate condensed consolidated financial statements for each company, along with notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, are included in this report. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, including NBCUniversal and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal, LLC as “NBCUniversal Holdings;” NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. as “NBCUniversal Enterprise;” and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 . This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should carefully review the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and particularly consider any risk factors set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called “forward-looking statements” by words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks outlined below and in other reports we file with the SEC. Actual events or our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ and Sky’s video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of NBCUniversal’s programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable regulation, the loss of Sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • the loss of Sky’s wholesale distribution agreements with traditional multichannel video providers could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • we rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions, including our acquisition of Sky, and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART

STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Business and Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired a 100 % interest in Sky through a series of transactions, for total cash consideration of £ 30.2 billion (approximately $ 39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). See Note 6 for additional information on the transaction. Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior year periods to conform to classifications used in 2019 . See Note 7 for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in six reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Our Cable Communications segment consists of the operations of Comcast Cable, which is one of the nation’s largest providers of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services (“cable services”) to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content, our regional sports and news networks, our international cable networks, our cable television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Filmed Entertainment segment consists primarily of the operations of Universal Pictures, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide; our films are also produced under the Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, we are developing a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China. Our Sky segment consists of the operations of Sky, one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, Comcast Cable’s wireless phone service and certain other Cable-related business development initiatives are now presented in the Cable Communications segment. Results were previously presented in Corporate and Other. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2018 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in the Sky segment. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.

Our potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our stock options and our restricted share units (“RSUs”). Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in which the combination of the option exercise price and the associated unrecognized compensation expense is greater than the average market price of our common stock. The amount of potential common shares related to our share-based compensation plans that were excluded from diluted EPS because their effect would have been antidilutive was not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 or 2018 . Note 5: Long-Term Debt As of June 30, 2019 , our debt had a carrying value of $ 107.6 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 118.5 billion . The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market values for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Debt Borrowings and Repayments For the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we had borrowings of $ 363 million related to the Universal Beijing Resort term loans. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we made repayments of $ 4.2 billion primarily related to our dollar-denominated term loan due 2022, NBCUniversal Enterprise senior notes due 2019 and our British pound-denominated term loan due 2023. Revolving Credit Facilities For the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we made net repayments of $ 615 million under Sky’s £ 1 billion revolving credit facility due 2021, which was terminated in February 2019. In June 2019, we amended the terms of our Comcast and NBCUniversal Enterprise revolving credit facilities to extend both facilities’ expiration dates from May 26, 2021 to May 26, 2022. As of June 30, 2019 , there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. Amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $ 8.7 billion . Commercial Paper Programs For the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we made net repayments of $ 186 million under our commercial paper programs. As of June 30, 2019 , Comcast had $ 488 million face amount of commercial paper outstanding. As of June 30, 2019 , NBCUniversal Enterprise had no commercial paper outstanding. Guarantee Structure Comcast, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal have fully and unconditionally guaranteed each other’s debt securities, including the Comcast revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2019 , the principal amount of debt securities outstanding within the cross-guarantee structure totaled $ 92.1 billion . Comcast and Comcast Cable fully and unconditionally guarantee NBCUniversal Enterprise’s debt securities, including its revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2019 , the principal amount of debt securities guaranteed by Comcast and Comcast Cable totaled $ 1.5 billion . NBCUniversal does not guarantee the NBCUniversal Enterprise senior notes, revolving credit facility or commercial paper program. 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Comcast provides an unconditional guarantee of the Universal Studios Japan yen-denominated ¥ 382 billion (approximately $ 3.5 billion using exchange rates as of June 30, 2019 ) term loans with a final maturity of March 2022. None of Comcast, Comcast Cable nor NBCUniversal guarantee the ¥ 6.4 billion RMB (approximately $ 936 million using exchange rates as of June 30, 2019 ) principal amount of Universal Beijing Resort term loans outstanding. In May 2019, Comcast provided a full and unconditional guarantee of Sky’s debt (approximately $ 10.0 billion using exchange rates as of June 30, 2019 ) in connection with Sky’s noteholders consenting to (i) the transfer of the listing of three series of notes from the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange to the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange and (ii) amending certain terms of the Sky notes. Note 6: Significant Transactions Sky Transaction On October 9, 2018, in connection with our offer to acquire the share capital of Sky, we acquired a controlling interest in Sky through a series of purchases of Sky shares at our offer price of £ 17.28 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining Sky shares and now own 100 % of Sky’s equity interests. Total cash consideration was £ 30.2 billion (approximately $ 39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). We financed the acquisition through a combination of new fixed and floating rate notes, issuance of term loans and cash on hand. Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Allocation of Purchase Price We have applied acquisition accounting to Sky. Sky’s results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date and are reported in our Sky segment. The net assets of Sky were recorded at their estimated fair value using primarily Level 3 inputs. In valuing acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates are based on, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations and appropriate discount rates. During the first quarter of 2019, we revised our estimates of fair value, primarily related to intangible assets, property and equipment, and investments (included below in other noncurrent assets and (liabilities), net), and recorded corresponding updates to deferred taxes. We also recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately $ 1.2 billion associated with our assessment of the realization of Sky’s deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating losses. These changes resulted in an increase in goodwill of approximately $ 1.4 billion and an adjustment in the first quarter of 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that resulted in an increase to depreciation and amortization expense of $ 53 million . The table below presents the allocation of the all-cash purchase price of £ 30.2 billion , or $ 39.4 billion , to the assets and liabilities of Sky as a result of the transaction. Allocation of Purchase Price (in millions) Consideration transferred $ 39,387 Allocation of purchase price Cash $ 1,283 Accounts receivable and other current assets 2,359 Film and television costs 2,512 Property and equipment 4,127 Intangible assets 19,539 Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities ( 5,885 ) Long-term debt ( 11,468 ) Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net ( 2,974 ) Other noncurrent assets and (liabilities), net ( 1,398 ) Fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 8,095 Goodwill $ 31,292 Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes customer premise equipment with a carrying value of $ 1.4 billion , which have original estimated useful lives of 5 to 7 years . The remaining property and equipment consists of real estate and improvements, network assets and other equipment. 12 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Intangible Assets Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships with a carrying amount of $ 9.5 billion and developed technology and software with a carrying amount of $ 4.3 billion , with original estimated useful lives between 6 and 19 years and 4 and 9 years , respectively. Indefinite-lived assets consist of trade names with a carrying amount of $ 5.8 billion . Goodwill Goodwill consists primarily of intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint, assembled workforce, noncontractual relationships and agreements. The acquired goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition-Related Costs As a result of the Sky transaction, we incurred incremental expenses in 2018 related to legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services, which are reflected in other operating and administrative expenses. We also incurred certain financing costs associated with our borrowings, which are reflected in interest expense. The table below presents the amounts related to these expenses included in our condensed consolidated statement of income. (in millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Other operating and administrative expenses $ 11 $ 21 Interest expense $ 11 $ 11 Unaudited Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma information has been presented as if the Sky transaction occurred on January 1, 2017. This information is based on historical results of operations, adjusted for allocation of purchase price and other acquisition accounting adjustments, and is not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the business since January 1, 2017. For pro forma purposes, 2018 earnings were adjusted to exclude the acquisition-related costs. No pro forma adjustments have been made for cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. (in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Revenue $ 26,653 $ 54,415 Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 2,957 $ 5,940 Basic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.65 $ 1.29 Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.64 $ 1.27 Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain financial and operating covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of ¥ 26.6 billion RMB (approximately $ 4 billion ). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of June 30, 2019 , Universal Beijing Resort had $ 936 million principal amount of term loans outstanding under the debt financing agreements. We have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a variable interest entity based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30 % interest. Universal Beijing Resort’s results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the “construction of Universal Beijing Resort” and “proceeds from borrowings” captions, respectively, and equity contributions from our investing partner are included in other financing activities. In March 2018, Universal Beijing Resort received initial equity investments through a combination of cash and noncash contributions from the investors. As of June 30, 2019 , our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loans, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 2.1 billion and $ 1.5 billion , respectively. 13 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 7: Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The most significant change in the updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all operating leases with the exception of short-term leases. The standard also expands the disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease did not significantly change from previous guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted to reflect the impacts of the updated guidance. In addition, as permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, prior scoping and classification conclusions were carried forward for leases existing as of the adoption date. Upon adoption, we recorded $ 4.2 billion and $ 4.8 billion for operating lease assets and liabilities, respectively, which includes the impact of fair value adjustments, prepaid and deferred rent and lease incentives. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not significantly impact our recognition of finance leases, which were previously described as capital leases. As of the date of adoption, our liabilities for finance leases were $ 787 million , including $ 229 million of additional contracts determined to be leases in connection with the Sky transaction , which were recorded in long-term debt, and the related assets were recorded in property and equipment, net. Our finance leases were not considered material for further disclosure. The adoption of the new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 11 for further information. Film and Television Costs In March 2019, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The updated guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs, and requires impairment testing to be performed at a group level for capitalized film and television costs when the content is predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, however we do not expect there to be a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows.

We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , we recognized losses of $ 106 million and income of $ 268 million , respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , we recognized income of $ 151 million and $ 186 million , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we made cash capital contributions totaling $ 463 million and $ 112 million , respectively. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 3.4 billion and $ 2.7 billion , respectively. In April 2018, we sold a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses to Atairos and received as consideration additional equity interests in Atairos. We account for our retained ownership in the businesses as an equity method investment. In connection with the sale of the businesses, we recognized a pretax gain of $ 200 million in other operating gains in the second quarter of 2018. Hulu In May 2019, we entered into a series of agreements (the “Hulu Transaction”) with The Walt Disney Company (“Disney”), whereby we relinquished our board seats and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, LLC (""Hulu""), and Disney assumed full operational control. We also acquired our proportionate share of the approximate 10 % interest in Hulu previously held by AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) for approximately $ 477 million , increasing our ownership interest to approximately 33 % from approximately 30 % . Following the Hulu Transaction, future capital calls are limited to $ 1.5 billion in the aggregate each year, with any excess funding requirements funded with member loans. We have the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of these capital calls, and if we elect not to fund our share of future equity capital calls, our ownership interest will be diluted, subject to an ownership floor of 21 % . The Hulu Transaction agreements include put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we can require Disney to buy, and Disney can require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $ 27.5 billion for 100 % of the equity of Hulu. The minimum total equity value and ownership floor guarantee minimum proceeds of approximately $ 5.8 billion upon exercise of the put or call. In connection with the Hulu Transaction, we agreed to extend certain Hulu licenses of NBCUniversal content until late 2024. We can terminate most of our content license agreements with Hulu in three years’ time, and in one year’s time we have the right to exhibit certain content that we currently license exclusively to Hulu on our platforms in return for reducing the license fee payable by Hulu. 15 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation We account for our investment using the equity method. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , we recognized losses of $ 109 million and $ 250 million , respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , we recognized losses of $ 107 million and $ 238 million , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we made cash capital contributions totaling $ 903 million , inclusive of the funding for the acquisition of the AT&T interest, and $ 227 million , respectively. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 857 million and $ 248 million , respectively. In August 2016, Time Warner Inc., which was acquired by AT&T in 2018, acquired a 10 % interest in Hulu, diluting our interest at that time from approximately 33 % to approximately 30 % . Given the contingent nature of the put and call options related to that interest, we recorded a deferred gain as a result of the dilution. In the first quarter of 2019, the put and call options expired unexercised and we recognized the previously deferred gain of $ 159 million in other income (loss), net. The Weather Channel In March 2018, we sold our investment in The Weather Channel cable network and recognized a pretax gain of $ 64 million in other income (loss), net. Marketable Equity Securities Snap For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , we recognized unrealized gains of $ 96 million and $ 258 million , respectively, in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net related to our investment in Snap. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , we recognized unrealized losses of $ 82 million and $ 45 million , respectively, related to our investment in Snap. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment in Snap was $ 420 million and $ 162 million , respectively. Other Investments AirTouch We hold two series of preferred stock of Verizon Americas, Inc., formerly known as AirTouch Communications, Inc. (“AirTouch”), a subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc., which are redeemable in April 2020. As of both June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment in AirTouch was $ 1.6 billion . We account for our investment in AirTouch as a held to maturity investment using the cost method. As of June 30, 2019 , the estimated fair value of the AirTouch preferred stock and the estimated fair value of the associated liability related to the redeemable subsidiary preferred shares issued by one of our consolidated subsidiaries were each $ 1.7 billion . The estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs that use pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Note 10: Supplemental Financial Information Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation plans consist primarily of awards of RSUs and stock options to certain employees and directors as part of our approach to long-term incentive compensation. Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. In March 2019 , we granted 12.4 million RSUs and 41.9 million stock options related to our annual management awards. The weighted-average fair values associated with these grants were $ 39.88 per RSU and $ 7.91 per stock option.

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally utilize our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The lease asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are not recorded for leases with an initial term of one year or less. Lease expense for operating leases recorded in the balance sheet is included in operating costs and expenses and is based on the future minimum lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease plus any variable lease costs. Operating lease expenses, inclusive of short-term and variable lease expenses, recognized in our condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $ 264 million and $ 538 million , respectively. These amounts do not include lease costs associated with production activities or other amounts capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, which are not material. 17 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation The table below summarizes the operating lease assets and liabilities recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The estimated fair value is based on Level 2 inputs that use pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 18 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Contingencies We are a defendant in several lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of our businesses. In certain of these cases, other industry participants are also defendants, and also in certain of these cases, we expect that any potential liability would be in part or in whole the responsibility of our equipment and technology vendors under applicable contractual indemnification provisions. In addition, we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. On October 9, 2018, in connection with our offer to acquire the share capital of Sky, we acquired a controlling interest in Sky through a series of purchases of Sky shares at our offer price of £17.28 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining Sky shares and now own 100% of Sky’s equity interests. Total cash consideration was £30.2 billion (approximately $39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). We financed the acquisition through a combination of new fixed and floating rate notes, issuance of term loans and cash on hand. Cable Communications Segment Comcast Cable is one of the nation’s largest providers of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services (“cable services”) to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. As of June 30, 2019 , our cable systems had 30.9 million total customer relationships, including 28.5 million residential and 2.4 million business customer relationships, and passed approximately 58 million homes and businesses. Our Cable Communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our cable services, which we market individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. NBCUniversal Segments NBCUniversal is one of the world’s leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks worldwide . Cable Networks Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of a diversified portfolio of cable television networks. Our cable networks are comprised of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations; and our various digital properties. Our Cable Networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers; from the sale of advertising on our cable networks and digital properties; from the licensing of our owned programming, including programming from our cable television studio production operations, to cable and broadcast networks and subscription video on demand services; and from the sale of our owned programming on standard-definition digital video discs and Blu-ray discs (together, “DVDs”) and through digital distribution services such as iTunes. Broadcast Television Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and our various digital properties. Our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue primarily from the sale of advertising on our broadcast networks, owned local broadcast television stations and digital properties; from the licensing of our owned programming by our broadcast television studio production operations to various distribution platforms, including to cable and broadcast networks as well as to subscription video on demand services; from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated local broadcast television stations; and from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenue primarily from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, from the licensing of produced and acquired films through various distribution platforms, and from the sale of produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Our Filmed Entertainment segment also generates revenue from Fandango, a movie ticketing and entertainment business, the sale of consumer products, the production and licensing of live stage plays, and the distribution of filmed entertainment produced by third parties. 27 Table of Contents Theme Parks Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China. Our Theme Parks segment generates revenue primarily from ticket sales and guest spending at our Universal theme parks. Sky Segment Our Sky segment consists of the operations of Sky, one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. As of June 30, 2019 , Sky had 24.0 million retail customer relationships. Corporate and Other Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Competition The results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation, which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of NBCUniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television programming and Sky’s owned television channels. For additional information on the competition our businesses face, see our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and refer to Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the “Competition” discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled “Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “Changes in consumer behavior driven by online distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.” Seasonality and Cyclicality Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. In our Cable Communications segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year. In our Sky segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving direct-to-home (“DTH”) and over the top (“OTT”) video services, including the start of the new soccer seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of each year due to higher marketing expenses. Revenue in our Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Sky segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is also cyclical, with a benefit in even-numbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising. Revenue in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. The results of Sky’s advertising business are subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. This includes seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup ™ . The results for Sky’s content business are also subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in timing, nature and quantity of original programming distributed to other markets. Our revenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains) are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, which affect our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments, and the Super Bowl, which affects our Broadcast Television segment. In particular, our advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time and our distribution revenue increases in the period of these broadcasts. Our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees. 28 Table of Contents Revenue in our Filmed Entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. Content licensing revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees. Revenue in our Theme Parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the holiday season. Exclusive tier one sports rights, such as domestic and UEFA Champions League soccer, Formula 1, and English cricket, play a key role within Sky’s wider content strategy. In Europe broadcasting rights for tier one sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality for Sky, although the staggered timing of tier one sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market.

Sky’s results of operations are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements following the October 9, 2018 acquisition date. Consolidated Revenue Our Sky, Cable Communications, Theme Parks and Cable Networks segments accounted for the increase in consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2019 , which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our Filmed Entertainment segment. Our Sky, Cable Communications and Theme Parks segments accounted for the increase in consolidated revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 , which was partially offset by decreases in revenue in our Broadcast Television, Cable Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Consolidated revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2018 included revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and the 2018 Super Bowl in February 2018. Revenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Revenue for our business development initiatives and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Corporate and Other Results of Operations.” Consolidated Costs and Expenses Our Sky, Cable Communications, Theme Parks and Cable Networks segments accounted for the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2019 , which was partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses in our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments. Our Sky, Cable Communications and Theme Parks segments accounted for the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2019 , which was partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses in our Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Cable Networks segments.

During the first quarter of 2019, we recorded adjustments to the purchase price allocation of Sky, primarily related to intangible assets and property and equipment. This change resulted in an adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2019 related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that increased depreciation and amortization expense by $53 million . Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $499 million and $1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively. Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $236 million and $441 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011 (see Note 6 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Sky transaction). Consolidated Other Operating Gains Consolidated other operating gains for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 included $200 million related to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in Corporate and Other (see Note 9 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements). 30 Table of Contents Consolidated Interest Expense Consolidated interest expense increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increases in our debt outstanding associated with the financing of and debt assumed in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The income (losses) at Atairos were driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments. The losses at Hulu were primarily due to programming, advertising and marketing costs, and higher other administrative expenses. The equity in net income (losses) of Atairos and Hulu for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 are presented in the table below. Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (in millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Atairos $ (106 ) $ 151 $ 268 $ 186 Hulu $ (109 ) $ (107 ) $ (250 ) $ (238 ) Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities, Net The realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to unrealized gains of $96 million and $258 million , respectively, related to our investment in Snap. Other Income (Loss), Net Other income (loss), net included $56 million of pretax losses due to the impairment of an equity method investment in the second quarter of 2019 and the recognition of the previously deferred gain related to Hulu of $159 million recorded in the first quarter of 2019. Other income (loss), net included a $64 million pretax gain related to the sale of our investment in the Weather Channel cable network in the first quarter of 2018. See Note 9 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 8 to NBCUniversal’s condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to lower taxable income from operations. The increase in income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to higher taxable income from operations. We also recognized an income tax benefit of $128 million during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of federal tax legislation in 2018. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 to both Comcast’s and NBCUniversal’s condensed consolidated financial statements for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes. 31 Table of Contents Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, Comcast Cable’s wireless phone service and certain other Cable-related business development initiatives are now presented in the Cable Communications segment.

Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our cable services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) advanced services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. In 2017, we began to offer prepaid services that allow customers to prepay for at least 30 days of service. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of June 30, 2019 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 174,000 and 6,000, respectively. Wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was $156.44 and $156.29 , respectively. Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was $155.91 and $155.47 , respectively. This metric is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our high-speed internet, video, voice and wireless services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was $63.38 and $63.01 , respectively. Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was $61.07 and $60.05 , respectively. Each of our cable services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services. 33 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment – Revenue High-Speed Internet High-speed internet revenue increased 9.4% and 9.8% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 . Increases in the number of residential customers receiving our high-speed internet services accounted for increases in revenue of 5.0% for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 . The remaining increases in revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were primarily due to increases in average high-speed internet rates. Video Video revenue was flat for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to declines in the number of residential video customers, partially offset by increases in average video rates. We have experienced, and expect that we will continue to experience, declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures, and we expect that our video revenue will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns. We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs, such as promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments. Voice Voice revenue decreased 1.1% and 1.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to declines in the number of residential voice customers. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Wireless revenue increased 21.0% and 21.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increases in the number of customer lines. Although customer lines increased, the number of wireless handsets sold declined in both periods due to the number of customers electing to bring their own device. Business Services Business services revenue increased 9.8% and 9.7% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 . The increases were primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving our small and medium-sized business services offerings and increases in average rates. We believe the increases in the number of business customers are primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing. We expect that the contribution to our growth rate from medium-sized and enterprise customers will increase relative to that of our small-business customers as small business services matures. Advertising Advertising revenue decreased 8.7% and 6.8% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to decreases in political advertising revenue. Excluding the impact of political advertising revenue, advertising revenue decreased 2.5% and 2.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 . For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , 4% of our Cable Communications segment advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , 4% of our Cable Communications segment advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Other Other revenue increased 6.0% and 6.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increases in revenue from our security and automation services. Additionally, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 , the remaining increase in revenue was due to an increase in revenue from the licensing of our technology platforms to other multichannel video providers. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increases in programming license fees, including sports programming costs and retransmission consent fees. We anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase, which may be at rates higher than those experienced recently, due to the timing of contract renewals in the future. 34 Table of Contents Technical and product support expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . The increases were primarily due to expenses related to the continued development, deployment and support of our products and services and expenses related to the continued growth in business services, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our wireless phone service. This decrease reflects the decline in the number of handsets sold due to customers electing to bring their own device, partially offset by increases in variable network fees as a result of the increase in customer lines. Customer service expenses decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to lower personnel costs as a result of reduced call volumes. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in spending associated with attracting new customers. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses were relatively flat for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 , reflecting the absence of advertising expenses associated with the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, offset by an increase in spending associated with attracting new customers. Franchise and other regulatory fees decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to decreases in the revenue to which the fees apply. Other operating costs and expenses were relatively flat for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our Cable Communications segment operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. The most significant operating costs and expenses for our Cable Communications segment are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which increased 1.8% and 2.3 % for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively. Our Cable Communications segment operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was 40.5% and 40.3% , respectively. Our Cable Communications segment operating margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 was 39.2% and 38.6% , respectively. We continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, particularly residential high-speed internet and business services, and on improving losses related to our wireless phone service and overall operating cost management. Losses from our wireless phone service were $88 million and $191 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to losses of $185 million and $374 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , respectively.

The decrease in theatrical revenue was primarily due to the strong performance of several releases in prior year period, including Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom , which was partially offset by releases in our 2019 film slate, including The Secret Life of Pets 2 and Us . The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to the absence of revenue associated with the sale of a business in 2018. Content licensing revenue increased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements. Film Entertainment revenue decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to decreases in theatrical revenue and other revenue, which were partially offset by increases in content licensing revenue and home entertainment revenue. The decrease in theatrical revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2019 was due to the strong performances of several releases in our 2018 film slate, including Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom , which were partially offset by releases in our 2019 film slate, including How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, Us and The Secret Life of Pets 2. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to the absence of revenue associated with the sale of a business in 2018. The increase in content licensing revenue was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements. Home entertainment revenue increased primarily due to higher sales of 2019 releases, including Dr. Seuss ’ The Grinch, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and Glass , which were partially offset by sales of 2018 releases, including Fifty Shades Freed , Pitch Perfect 3 and American Made. Filmed Entertainment Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to decreases in programming and productions costs and advertising, marketing and promotion costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was due to higher amortization of film production costs in the prior year period. The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion costs was due to higher spending on the marketing of prior period releases. Operating costs and expenses decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to decreases in programming and productions costs, other operating and administrative costs, and advertising, marketing and promotion costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was due to higher amortization of film production costs in the prior year period. The decrease in other operating and administrative costs was due to the absence of expenses associated with the sale of a business in 2018 and a reduction in employee-related costs. The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion costs was due to a higher spending on the marketing of prior period releases.

Theme Parks revenue increased for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to increases in attendance. 40 Table of Contents Theme Parks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Theme Parks operating costs and expenses increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increased employee-related costs and higher marketing costs associated with Hagrid’s Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure TM in Orlando. Sky Segment Results of Operations The discussion below compares Sky’s actual results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 to pro forma results for Sky for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 . The pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the Sky transaction occurred on January 1, 2017. Our pro forma data is also adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting and eliminating the costs and expenses directly related to the transaction, but does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined business. Pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the Sky business since January 1, 2017, nor of our future results.

Commercial retail customers include hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants with an active subscription for the purpose of providing Sky services to third party customers. We report commercial customers based on the number of commercial agreements per venue in the U.K., a residential equivalent unit based upon the multiple of residential customer revenue in Italy and the number of active venues (bars and restaurants) or rooms (hotels and clinics) in Germany. Sky Segment – Revenue Direct-to-Consumer Direct-to-consumer revenue decreased 4.0% and 5.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct-to-consumer revenue increased 1.7% and 0.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018, primarily due to growth in video, mobile and broadband customers, partially offset by a decrease in average revenue per customer relationship. The increase in video customers for the three months ended June 30, 2019 included growth in streaming customers as a result of unique content launches. Content Content revenue increased 21.0% and 25.1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, content revenue increased 27.7% and 32.6% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 , reflecting the wholesaling of sports programming, including exclusive sports rights recently acquired in Italy and Germany, as well as monetization of our slate of original programming. Advertising Advertising revenue decreased 10.7% and 8.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, advertising revenue decreased 5.6% and 2.5% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 , primarily reflecting overall market weakness. Sky Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and production costs were flat for the three months ended June 30, 2019 , compared to the same period in 2018 . Programming and production costs increased 1.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2019 , compared to the same period in 2018 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs increased 6.7% and 8.0% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to new sports programming contracts in Italy and Germany. Direct network costs increased 3.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and were flat for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same periods in 2018 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct network costs increased 9.7% and 6.2% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to increases in costs associated with Sky’s wireless phone service as a result of increases in the number of customers receiving the service. Other expenses decreased 16.9% and 13.0% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 . Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses decreased 12.1% and 7.4% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2018 primarily due to contract termination costs and costs related to a settlement in the prior year period. 42 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Results of Operations Three Months Ended June 30 Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2019 2018 $ % Revenue $ 56 $ 96 $ (40 ) (42.0 )% Operating costs and expenses 353 288 65 22.7 Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs (84 ) — (84 ) NM Adjusted EBITDA $ (213 ) $ (192 ) $ (21 ) (11.0 )% Six Months Ended June 30 Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2019 2018 $ % Revenue $ 164 $ 339 $ (175 ) (51.6 )% Operating costs and expenses 699 716 (17 ) (2.3 ) Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs (135 ) — (135 ) NM Adjusted EBITDA $ (400 ) $ (377 ) $ (23 ) (6.1 )% Corporate and Other – Revenue Other revenue primarily relates to revenue from Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We sold a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in the second quarter of 2018. Corporate and Other – Operating Costs and Expenses Corporate and Other operating costs and expenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the costs of other business development initiatives, and operating costs and expenses associated with Comcast Spectacor. Corporate and Other operating costs and expenses increased for the three months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to transaction-related expenses of $84 million directly related to the Sky transaction, including expenses resulting from the replacement of share-based compensation awards and costs related to integration activities. Corporate and Other operating costs and expenses decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in the second quarter of 2018, which was partially offset by transaction-related expenses of $135 million directly related to the Sky transaction, including expenses resulting from the replacement of share-based compensation awards and costs related to integration activities. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA excludes transaction-related expenses directly related to the Sky transaction. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 43 Table of Contents We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from consolidated Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income, net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP.

Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures, investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders.

Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, purchases of investments and cash paid for intangible assets. Capital expenditures increased for the six months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of spending at Sky and an increase in spending by our Theme Parks segment, partially offset by a decrease in spending by our Cable Communications segment due to lower spending on scalable infrastructure and customer premise equipment. Purchases of investments for the six months ended June 30, 2019 consisted primarily of our cash capital contributions of $903 million to Hulu and $463 million to Atairos. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repayments of our term loans and repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Notes 5 and 6 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financing activities, including details of our debt repayments and borrowings. Available Borrowings Under Credit Facilities We also maintain significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of June 30, 2019 , amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $8.7 billion . Share Repurchases and Dividends Effective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $12 billion , which does not have an expiration date. Under the authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We have paused our share repurchase program for 2019 in order to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky and no common stock share repurchases were made under this authorization for the six months ended June 30, 2019 . 45 Table of Contents We paid $350 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2019 , our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.84 per share on an annualized basis. In May 2019 , our Board of Directors approved our second quarter dividend of $0.21 per share to be paid in July 2019 . We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. On April 24, 2019, we paid dividends totaling $954 million . Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

NBCUniversal is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business and does not expect the final disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, although any such matters could be time-consuming and costly and could injure its reputation. ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS There have been no significant changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 5: OTHER INFORMATION Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, companies are required, among other things, to disclose certain activities, transactions or dealings with the Government of Iran or entities controlled directly or indirectly by the Government of Iran. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and are de minimis . As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing during the three months ended June 30, 2019 that requires disclosure under the Act, except with respect to a licensing agreement entered by one of Sky’s non-U.S. subsidiaries prior to our fourth quarter 2018 acquisition of Sky. The agreement entered into in June 2012 and amended in July 2016 licensed 150 hours of programming content for various three-year license terms for a one-time fee of €86,250 to a broadcasting company that is owned and controlled by the Government of Iran. We believe that Sky conducted its licensing activity in compliance with applicable laws and that these licenses are for the permissible exportation of informational materials pursuant to certain statutory and regulatory exemptions from U.S. sanctions.

Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation Unless indicated otherwise, throughout these notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we refer to NBCUniversal and its consolidated subsidiaries as “we,” “us” and “our.” We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. See Note 6 for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in four reportable business segments: Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content, our regional sports and news networks, our international cable networks, our cable television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Filmed Entertainment segment consists primarily of the operations of Universal Pictures, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide; our films are also produced under the Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, we are developing a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to NBCUniversal excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, 2018 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in Headquarters and Other. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below.

(b) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another, which consisted primarily of the licensing of film and television content from our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments to our Cable Networks segment; for segment reporting, this revenue is recognized as the programming rights asset for the licensed content is amortized based on third party revenue. (c) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to NBCUniversal before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below.

Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet The following tables summarize our accounts receivable and other balances that are not separately presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheet that relate to the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash . (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Receivables, gross $ 7,304 $ 7,392 Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts 110 99 Receivables, net $ 7,194 $ 7,293 (in millions) June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Noncurrent receivables, net (included in other noncurrent assets, net) $ 1,181 $ 1,180 Noncurrent deferred revenue (included in other noncurrent liabilities) $ 657 $ 481 58 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC Note 4: Long-Term Debt As of June 30, 2019 , our debt, excluding our revolving credit agreement with Comcast, had a carrying value of $ 13.4 billion and an estimated fair value of $ 14.2 billion . The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market values for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Debt Borrowings and Repayments For the six months ended June 30, 2019 , Universal Beijing Resort borrowed $ 363 million under its debt financing agreement to fund the construction of a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (see Note 5). For the six months ended June 30, 2019 , we repaid $ 73 million of Universal Studios Japan term loans maturing 2022. Guarantee Structure We, Comcast and a 100 % owned cable holding company subsidiary of Comcast (“CCCL Parent”) have fully and unconditionally guaranteed each other’s debt securities, including the $ 7.6 billion Comcast revolving credit facility due 2022. As of June 30, 2019 , $ 84.4 billion principal amount of outstanding debt securities of Comcast and CCCL Parent were subject to the cross-guarantee structure. We do not, however, guarantee the obligations of NBCUniversal Enterprise with respect to its $ 1.5 billion outstanding debt securities, including its revolving credit facility, nor its $ 725 million liquidation preference of Series A cumulative preferred stock. The Universal Studios Japan term loans are not subject to the cross-guarantee structure, however they have a separate guarantee from Comcast. The Universal Beijing Resort term loans are not guaranteed. Note 5: Significant Transactions Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30 % interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain financial and operating covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of ¥ 26.6 billion RMB (approximately $ 4 billion ). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of June 30, 2019 , Universal Beijing Resort had $ 936 million principal amount of term loans outstanding under the debt financing agreements. We have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a variable interest entity based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30 % interest. Universal Beijing Resort’s results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the “construction of Universal Beijing Resort” and “proceeds from borrowings” captions, respectively, and equity contributions from our investing partner are included in other financing activities. In March 2018, Universal Beijing Resort received initial equity investments through a combination of cash and noncash contributions from the investors. As of June 30, 2019 , our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loans, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $ 2.1 billion and $ 1.5 billion , respectively. Note 6: Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The most significant change in the updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all operating leases with the exception of short-term leases. The standard also expands the disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease did not significantly change from previous guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted to reflect the impacts of the updated guidance. In addition, as permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, prior scoping and classification conclusions were carried forward for leases existing as of the adoption date. 59 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC Upon adoption, we recorded approximately $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.8 billion of operating lease assets and liabilities, respectively, which includes the impact of fair value adjustments, prepaid rent and lease incentives. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not impact our recognition of finance leases, which were previously described as capital leases. As of the date of adoption, our liabilities for finance leases were $ 332 million , which were recorded in long-term debt, and the related assets were recorded in property and equipment, net. Our finance leases were not considered material for further disclosure. The adoption of the new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 9 for further information. Film and Television Costs In March 2019, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The updated guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs, and requires impairment testing to be performed at a group level for capitalized film and television costs when the content is predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, however we do not expect there to be a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows.

We also acquired our proportionate share of the approximate 10 % interest in Hulu previously held by AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) for approximately $ 477 million , increasing our ownership interest to approximately 33 % from approximately 30 % . Following the Hulu Transaction, future capital calls are limited to $ 1.5 billion in the aggregate each year, with any excess funding requirements funded with member loans. We have the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of these capital calls, and if we elect not to fund our share of future equity capital calls, our ownership interest will be diluted, subject to an ownership floor of 21 % . The Hulu Transaction agreements include put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we can require Disney to buy, and Disney can require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $ 27.5 billion for 100 % of the equity of Hulu. The minimum total equity value and ownership floor guarantee minimum proceeds of approximately $ 5.8 billion upon exercise of the put or call. In connection with the Hulu Transaction, we agreed to extend certain Hulu licenses of NBCUniversal content until late 2024. We can terminate most of our content license agreements with Hulu in three years’ time, and in one year’s time we have the right to exhibit certain content that we currently license exclusively to Hulu on our platforms in return for reducing the license fee payable by Hulu. We account for our investment using the equity method. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , we recognized losses of $ 109 million and $ 250 million , respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 , we recognized losses of $ 107 million and $ 238 million , respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , we made cash capital contributions totaling $ 903 million , inclusive of the funding for the acquisition of the AT&T interest, and $ 227 million , respectively. As of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment was $ 857 million and $ 248 million , respectively. In August 2016, Time Warner Inc., which was acquired by AT&T in 2018, acquired a 10 % interest in Hulu, diluting our interest at that time from approximately 33 % to approximately 30 % . Given the contingent nature of the put and call options related to that interest, we recorded a deferred gain as a result of the dilution. In the first quarter of 2019, the put and call options expired unexercised and we recognized the previously deferred gain of $ 159 million in other income (loss), net.

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally utilize our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The lease asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are not recorded for leases with an initial term of one year or less. Lease expense for operating leases recorded in the balance sheet is included in operating costs and expenses and is based on the future minimum lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease plus any variable lease costs. Operating lease expenses, inclusive of short-term and variable lease expenses, recognized in our condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $ 110 million and $ 221 million , respectively. These amounts do not include lease costs associated with production activities or other amounts capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, which are not material. The table below summarizes the operating lease assets and liabilities recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Comcast owns all of the common equity interests in NBCUniversal, and NBCUniversal meets the conditions set forth in General Instruction H(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-Q and is therefore filing its information within this Form 10-Q with the reduced disclosure format. Each of Comcast and NBCUniversal is filing on its own behalf the information contained in this report that relates to itself, and neither company makes any representation as to information relating to the other company. Where information or an explanation is provided that is substantially the same for each company, such information or explanation has been combined in this report. Where information or an explanation is not substantially the same for each company, separate information and explanation has been provided. In addition, separate condensed consolidated financial statements for each company, along with notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, are included in this report. Unless indicated otherwise, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we refer to Comcast and its consolidated subsidiaries, including NBCUniversal and its consolidated subsidiaries, as “we,” “us” and “our;” Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Comcast Cable;” Comcast Holdings Corporation as “Comcast Holdings;” NBCUniversal, LLC as “NBCUniversal Holdings;” NBCUniversal Enterprise, Inc. as ""NBCUniversal Enterprise;"" and Sky Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries as “Sky.” This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q modifies and supersedes documents filed before it. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with it, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents. Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should carefully review the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and particularly consider any risk factors set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in other reports or documents that we file from time to time with the SEC. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called “forward-looking statements” by words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “potential,” or “continue,” or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks outlined below and in other reports we file with the SEC. Actual events or our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our businesses may be affected by, among other things, the following: • our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively • changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models • a decline in advertisers’ expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses • our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments • we are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities, which impose additional costs and restrictions on our businesses • programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications’ and Sky’s video businesses • NBCUniversal’s and Sky’s success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase • the loss of NBCUniversal’s programming distribution agreements, or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect our businesses • less favorable regulation, the loss of Sky’s transmission agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms, could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • the loss of Sky’s wholesale distribution agreements with traditional multichannel video providers could adversely affect Sky’s businesses • we rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses • our businesses depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property rights and on not infringing the intellectual property rights of others • we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware, software and operational support • weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses • acquisitions, including our acquisition of Sky, and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated • unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures • labor disputes, whether involving employees or sports organizations, may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our businesses • the loss of key management personnel or popular on-air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our businesses • we face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses • our Class B common stock has substantial voting rights and separate approval rights over several potentially material transactions, and our Chairman and CEO has considerable influence over our company through his beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock Table of Contents PART

Consolidated Financial Statements Business and Basis of Presentation We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired a 100% interest in Sky through a series of transactions, for total cash consideration of £30.2 billion (approximately $39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). See Note 6 for additional information on the transaction. Reclassifications Reclassifications have been made to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the prior year period to conform to classifications used in 2019 . See Note 7 for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in six reportable business segments: (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. Our Cable Communications segment consists of the operations of Comcast Cable, which is one of the nation’s largest providers of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services (“cable services”) to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content, our regional sports and news networks, our international cable networks, our cable television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Filmed Entertainment segment consists primarily of the operations of Universal Pictures, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide; our films are also produced under the Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, we are developing a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China. Our Sky segment consists of the operations of Sky, one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to Comcast Corporation excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, Comcast Cable’s wireless phone service and certain other Cable-related business development initiatives are now presented in the Cable Communications segment. Results were previously presented in Corporate and Other. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2018 operating results were 6 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in the Sky segment. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 14,280 $ 5,728 $ 2,035 $ 1,363 $ 323 NBCUniversal Cable Networks 2,868 1,262 182 6 2 Broadcast Television 2,467 387 39 13 3 Filmed Entertainment 1,768 364 19 4 5 Theme Parks 1,276 498 162 394 19 Headquarters and Other (a) 17 (174 ) 113 36 42 Eliminations (b) (83 ) — — — — NBCUniversal 8,313 2,337 515 453 71 Sky 4,797 663 741 259 151 Corporate and Other (c) 108 (187 ) 29 17 2 Eliminations (b) (639 ) 12 — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 26,859 $ 8,553 $ 3,320 $ 2,092 $ 547 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (d) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Communications $ 13,703 $ 5,217 $ 2,061 $ 1,691 $ 287 NBCUniversal Cable Networks (e) 3,157 1,254 189 3 4 Broadcast Television (e) 3,497 507 34 30 72 Filmed Entertainment 1,647 203 28 7 6 Theme Parks 1,281 495 155 182 16 Headquarters and Other (a) 14 (188 ) 104 47 32 Eliminations (b)(e) (99 ) — — — — NBCUniversal 9,497 2,271 510 269 130 Corporate and Other (c) 243 (185 ) 28 13 2 Eliminations (b)(e) (652 ) (59 ) — — — Comcast Consolidated $ 22,791 $ 7,244 $ 2,599 $ 1,973 $ 419 (a) NBCUniversal Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. (b) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. The most common types of transactions are the following: • our Cable Networks segment generates revenue by selling programming to our Cable Communications segment, which represents a substantial majority of the revenue elimination amount • our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements with our Cable Communications segment • our Cable Communications segment generates revenue by selling advertising and by selling the use of satellite feeds to our Cable Networks segment • our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by selling advertising to our Cable Communications segment • our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by licensing content to our Cable Networks segment; for segment reporting, this revenue is recognized as the programming rights asset for the licensed content is amortized based on third party revenue • our Filmed Entertainment, Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments generate revenue by licensing content to our Sky segment (c) Corporate and Other activities include costs associated with overhead and personnel, revenue and expenses associated with operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well as other business development initiatives. (d) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related 7 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below. Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,553 $ 7,244 Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs (51 ) — Depreciation (2,240 ) (2,011 ) Amortization (1,080 ) (588 ) Interest expense (1,150 ) (777 ) Investment and other income (loss), net 676 126 Income before income taxes $ 4,708 $ 3,994 (e) The revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics were reported in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments.

(b) Comcast Cable’s wireless phone service is now presented in the Cable Communications segment. Results were previously presented in Corporate and Other. We recognize revenue from our wireless phone service as the services are provided, similar to how we recognize revenue for other residential cable services. We recognize revenue from the sale of handsets at the point of sale. (c) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another. See Note 2 for a description of these transactions. 9 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation We operate primarily in the United States but also in select international markets. The table below summarizes revenue by geographic location.

Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet The following tables summarize our accounts receivable and other balances that are not separately presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheet that relate to the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash , as well as deferred costs associated with our contracts with customers. (in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Receivables, gross $ 11,161 $ 11,456 Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts 425 352 Receivables, net $ 10,736 $ 11,104 (in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Noncurrent receivables, net (included in other noncurrent assets, net) $ 1,379 $ 1,399 Contract acquisition and fulfillment costs (included in other noncurrent assets, net) $ 1,001 $ 991 Noncurrent deferred revenue (included in other noncurrent liabilities) $ 786 $ 650 Note 4: Earnings Per Share Computation of Diluted EPS Three Months Ended March 31 2019 2018 (in millions, except per share data) Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation Shares Per Share Amount Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation Shares Per Share Amount Basic EPS attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 3,553 4,534 $ 0.78 $ 3,118 4,633 $ 0.67 Effect of dilutive securities: Assumed exercise or issuance of shares relating to stock plans 60 72 Diluted EPS attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 3,553 4,594 $ 0.77 $ 3,118 4,705 $ 0.66 Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders (“diluted EPS”) considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. Our potentially dilutive securities include potential common shares related to our stock options and our restricted share units (“RSUs”). Diluted EPS excludes the impact of potential common shares related to our stock options in periods in which the combination of the option exercise price and the associated unrecognized compensation expense is greater than the average market price of our common stock. The amount of potential common shares related to our share-based compensation plans that were excluded from diluted EPS because their effect would have been antidilutive was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2019 or 2018 . 10 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 5: Long-Term Debt As of March 31, 2019 , our debt had a carrying value of $109.1 billion and an estimated fair value of $115.8 billion . The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market values for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Debt Borrowings and Repayments For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we had borrowings of $222 million related to the Universal Beijing Resort term loans. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we made debt repayments of $2.1 billion primarily related to our dollar-denominated term loan due 2022. Revolving Credit Facilities For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we made net repayments of $615 million under Sky’s £1 billion revolving credit facility due 2021, which was terminated in February 2019. As of March 31, 2019 , there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. Amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion . Commercial Paper Programs For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we made net repayments of $673 million under our commercial paper programs. As of March 31, 2019 , we had no commercial paper outstanding. Guarantee Structure Comcast, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal have fully and unconditionally guaranteed each other’s debt securities, including the Comcast revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2019 , the principal amount of debt securities within the cross-guarantee structure totaled $92.3 billion . Comcast and Comcast Cable fully and unconditionally guarantee NBCUniversal Enterprise’s $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, its revolving credit facility and its commercial paper program. NBCUniversal does not guarantee the NBCUniversal Enterprise senior notes, revolving credit facility or commercial paper program. Comcast Parent provides an unconditional guarantee of the Universal Studios Japan yen-denominated ¥385 billion (approximately $3.5 billion using exchange rates as of March 31, 2019 ) term loans with a final maturity of March 2022. None of Comcast, Comcast Cable nor NBCUniversal guarantee the ¥5.5 billion RMB ( $815 million using exchange rates as of March 31, 2019 ) principal amount of Universal Beijing Resort term loans outstanding. In March 2019, Sky announced a series of consent solicitations for holders of all of its outstanding debt (approximately $10.0 billion using exchange rates as of March 31, 2019). If all of the consent solicitations are successful, Comcast Parent will provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the Sky notes in exchange for noteholders consenting to (i) the transfer of the listing of three series of notes from the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange to the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange and (ii) amending certain terms of the Sky notes. Note 6: Significant Transactions Sky Transaction On October 9, 2018, in connection with our offer to acquire the share capital of Sky, we acquired a controlling interest in Sky through a series of purchases of Sky shares at our offer price of £17.28 per Sky share. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining Sky shares and now own 100% of Sky’s equity interests. Total cash consideration was £30.2 billion (approximately $39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). We financed the acquisition through a combination of new fixed and floating rate notes, issuance of term loans and cash on hand. Sky is one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. 11 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Allocation of Purchase Price We have applied acquisition accounting to Sky. Sky’s results of operations are included in our consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date and are reported in our Sky segment. The net assets of Sky were recorded at their estimated fair value using primarily Level 3 inputs. In valuing acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates are based on, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations and appropriate discount rates. During the first quarter 2019, we revised our estimates of fair value, primarily related to intangible assets, property and equipment, and investments (included below in other noncurrent assets and (liabilities), net), and recorded corresponding updates to deferred taxes. We also recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately $1.2 billion associated with our assessment of the realization of Sky’s deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating losses. These changes resulted in an increase in goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion and an adjustment in the current period related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that resulted in an increase to depreciation and amortization expense of $53 million . The table below presents the allocation of the all-cash purchase price of £30.2 billion , or $39.4 billion , to the assets and liabilities of Sky as a result of the transaction. Allocation of Purchase Price (in millions) Consideration transferred $ 39,387 Allocation of purchase price Cash $ 1,283 Accounts receivable and other current assets 2,359 Film and television costs 2,512 Property and equipment 4,127 Intangible assets 19,539 Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities (5,885 ) Long-term debt (11,468 ) Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net (2,974 ) Other noncurrent assets and (liabilities), net (1,398 ) Fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 8,095 Goodwill $ 31,292 Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes customer premise equipment with a carrying value of $1.4 billion , which have original estimated useful lives of 5 to 7 years . The remaining property and equipment consists of real estate and improvements, network assets and other equipment. Intangible Assets Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships with a carrying amount of $9.5 billion and developed technology and software with a carrying amount of $4.3 billion , with original estimated useful lives between 6 and 19 years and 4 to 9 years , respectively. Indefinite-lived assets consist of trade names with a carrying amount of $5.8 billion . Goodwill Goodwill consists primarily of intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including increased footprint, assembled workforce, noncontractual relationships and agreements. The acquired goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Unaudited Pro Forma Information The following unaudited pro forma information has been presented as if the Sky transaction occurred on January 1, 2017. This information is based on historical results of operations, adjusted for allocation of purchase price and other acquisition accounting adjustments, and is not necessarily indicative of what the results would have been had we operated the business since January 1, 2017. For pro forma purposes, 2018 earnings were adjusted to exclude transaction-related costs. No pro forma adjustments have been made for cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. 12 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation (in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Revenue $ 27,762 Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 2,983 Basic earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.64 Diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders $ 0.63 Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain financial and operating covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of ¥ 26.6 billion RMB (approximately $4 billion ). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of March 31, 2019 , Universal Beijing Resort had $815 million principal amount of term loans outstanding under the debt financing agreements. We have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a variable interest entity based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort’s results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the ""construction of Universal Beijing Resort"" and ""proceeds from borrowings"" captions, respectively, and equity contributions from our investing partner are included in other financing activities. In March 2018, Universal Beijing Resort received initial equity investments through a combination of cash and noncash contributions from the investors. As of March 31, 2019 , our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loans, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion , respectively. Note 7: Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The most significant change in the updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all operating leases with the exception of short-term leases. The standard also expands the disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease did not significantly change from previous guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted to reflect the impacts of the updated guidance. In addition, as permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, prior scoping and classification conclusions were carried forward for leases existing as of the adoption date. Upon adoption, we recorded $4.2 billion and $4.8 billion for operating lease assets and liabilities, respectively, which includes the impact of fair value adjustments, prepaid and deferred rent and lease incentives. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not significantly impact our recognition of finance leases, which were previously described as capital leases. As of the date of adoption, our liabilities for finance leases were $787 million , including $229 million of additional contracts determined to be leases in connection with the Sky transaction , which were recorded in long-term debt, and the related assets were recorded in property and equipment, net. Our finance leases were not considered material for further disclosure. The adoption of the new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 11 for further information. Film and Television Costs In March 2019, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The updated guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs, and requires impairment testing to be performed at a group level for capitalized film and television costs when the content is predominately monetized with other owned or licensed content. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, however we do not expect there to be a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. 13 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation Note 8: Film and Television Costs (in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Film Costs: Released, less amortization $ 1,544 $ 1,600 Completed, not released 40 144 In production and in development 1,267 1,063 2,851 2,807 Television Costs: Released, less amortization 2,390 2,289 In production and in development 820 953 3,210 3,242 Programming rights, less amortization 4,932 5,534 10,993 11,583 Less: Current portion of programming rights 2,942 3,746 Film and television costs $ 8,051 $ 7,837 Note 9: Investments Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 262 $ (49 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 214 28 Other income (loss), net 200 147 Investment and other income (loss), net $ 676 $ 126 (in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Equity method $ 4,960 $ 4,035 Marketable equity securities 538 341 Nonmarketable equity securities 1,942 1,805 Other investments 1,805 1,796 Total investments 9,245 7,977 Less: Current investments 86 94 Noncurrent investments $ 9,159 $ 7,883 Equity Method Atairos Atairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations.

For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized our proportionate share of Atairos’ income of $374 million and $35 million , respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we made cash capital contributions to Atairos totaling $37 million and $31 million , respectively. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment in Atairos was $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion , respectively. Hulu For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized our proportionate share of Hulu’s losses of $141 million and $131 million , respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we made cash capital contributions to Hulu totaling $233 million and $114 million , respectively. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment in Hulu was $341 million and $248 million , respectively. 14 Table of Contents Comcast Corporation In August 2016, Time Warner Inc. acquired a 10% interest in Hulu, which diluted our interest in Hulu from 33% to 30% . Given the contingent nature of put and call options related to its shares, we recorded a deferred gain as a result of the dilution. In the first quarter of 2019, the put and call options expired unexercised and we recognized the previously deferred gain of $159 million in other income (loss), net. The Weather Channel In March 2018, we sold our investment in The Weather Channel cable network and recognized a pretax gain of $64 million in other income (loss), net. Marketable Equity Securities Snap For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized unrealized gains of $162 million and $37 million , respectively, in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net related to our investment in Snap. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment in Snap was $324 million and $162 million , respectively. Other Investments AirTouch We hold two series of preferred stock of Verizon Americas, Inc., formerly known as AirTouch Communications, Inc. (“AirTouch”), a subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc., which are redeemable in April 2020. As of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment in AirTouch was $1.6 billion . We account for our investment in AirTouch as a held to maturity investment using the cost method. As of March 31, 2019 , the estimated fair value of the AirTouch preferred stock and the estimated fair value of the associated liability related to the redeemable subsidiary preferred shares issued by one of our consolidated subsidiaries were each $1.7 billion . The estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs that use pricing models whose inputs are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Note 10: Supplemental Financial Information Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation plans consist primarily of awards of RSUs and stock options to certain employees and directors as part of our approach to long-term incentive compensation. Additionally, through our employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. In March 2019 , we granted 12.4 million RSUs and 41.9 million stock options related to our annual management awards. The weighted-average fair values associated with these grants were $39.88 per RSU and $7.91 per stock option.

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally utilize our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The lease asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are not recorded for leases with an initial term of one year or less. Lease expense for operating leases recorded in the balance sheet is included in operating costs and expenses and is based on the future minimum lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease plus any variable lease costs. Operating lease expenses, inclusive of short-term and variable lease expenses, recognized in our condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $274 million . These amounts do not include lease costs associated with production activities or other amounts capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, which are not material.

Contingencies We are a defendant in several unrelated lawsuits claiming infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of our businesses. In certain of these cases, other industry participants are also defendants, and also in certain of these cases, we expect that any potential liability would be in part or in whole the responsibility of our equipment and technology vendors under applicable contractual indemnification provisions. In addition, we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While the amount of ultimate liability with respect to such actions is not expected to materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position, any litigation resulting from any such legal proceedings or claims could be time-consuming and injure our reputation.

a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal, and Sky. We present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments: Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks (collectively, the “NBCUniversal segments”); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. On October 9, 2018, in connection with our offer to acquire the share capital of Sky, we acquired a controlling interest in Sky through a series of purchases of Sky shares at our offer price of £17.28 per Sky share. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining Sky shares and now own 100% of Sky’s equity interests. Total cash consideration was £30.2 billion (approximately $39.4 billion using the exchange rates on the purchase dates). We financed the acquisition through a combination of new fixed and floating rate notes, issuance of term loans and cash on hand. Cable Communications Segment Comcast Cable is one of the nation’s largest providers of high-speed internet, video, voice, wireless, and security and automation services (“cable services”) to residential customers under the Xfinity brand ; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. As of March 31, 2019 , our cable systems had 30.7 million total customer relationships, including 28.4 million residential and 2.3 million business customer relationships, and passed approximately 58 million homes and businesses. Our Cable Communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers that subscribe to our cable services, which we market individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. NBCUniversal Segments NBCUniversal is one of the world’s leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, and owns and operates theme parks worldwide . Cable Networks Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of a diversified portfolio of cable television networks. Our cable networks are comprised of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content; our regional sports and news networks; our international cable networks; our cable television studio production operations; and our various digital properties. Our Cable Networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution of our cable network programming to traditional and virtual multichannel video providers; from the sale of advertising on our cable networks and digital properties; from the licensing of our owned programming, including programming from our cable television studio production operations, to cable and broadcast networks and subscription video on demand services; and from the sale of our owned programming on standard-definition digital video discs and Blu-ray discs (together, “DVDs”) and through digital distribution services such as iTunes. Broadcast Television Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and our various digital properties. Our Broadcast Television segment generates revenue primarily from the sale of advertising on our broadcast networks, owned local broadcast television stations and digital properties; from the licensing of our owned programming by our broadcast television studio production operations to various distribution platforms, including to cable and broadcast networks as well as to subscription video on demand services; from the fees received under retransmission consent agreements and associated fees received from NBC-affiliated local broadcast television stations; and from the sale of our owned programming on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenue primarily from the worldwide distribution of our produced and acquired films for exhibition in movie theaters, from the licensing of produced and acquired films through various distribution platforms, and from the sale of produced and acquired films on DVDs and through digital distribution services. Our Filmed Entertainment segment also generates revenue from Fandango, a movie ticketing and entertainment business, the sale of consumer products, the production and licensing of live stage plays, and the distribution of filmed entertainment produced by third parties. 24 Table of Contents Theme Parks Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, we are developing a theme park in Beijing, China. Our Theme Parks segment generates revenue primarily from ticket sales and guest spending at our Universal theme parks. Sky Segment Our Sky segment consists of the operations of Sky, one of Europe’s leading entertainment companies, which primarily includes a direct-to-consumer business, providing video, high-speed internet, voice and wireless phone services, and a content business, operating entertainment networks, the Sky News broadcast network and Sky Sports networks. As of March 31, 2019 , Sky had 23.7 million retail customer relationships. Corporate and Other Our other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Competition The results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and challenging existing business models. In particular, consumers are increasingly turning to online sources for viewing and purchasing content, which has and likely will continue to reduce the number of our video customers and subscribers to our cable networks even as it makes our high-speed internet services more valuable to consumers. In addition, the increasing number of entertainment choices available has intensified audience fragmentation, which has and likely will continue to adversely affect the audience ratings of NBCUniversal’s cable networks and broadcast television programming and Sky’s owned television channels. For additional information on the competition our businesses face, see our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and refer to Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors. Within the Business section, refer to the “Competition” discussion, and within the Risk Factors section, refer to the risk factors entitled “Our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively” and “Changes in consumer behavior driven by online distribution platforms for viewing content could adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.” Seasonality and Cyclicality Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. In our Cable Communications segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year. In our Sky segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving direct-to-home (""DTH"") and over the top (""OTT"") video services, including the start of the new soccer seasons and the Christmas holiday. This generally results in greater net customer relationship additions and higher subscriber acquisition costs in the fourth quarter of each year due to higher marketing expenses. Revenue in our Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Sky segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. Advertising revenue in the U.S. is also cyclical, with a benefit in even-numbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising. Revenue in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. The results of Sky’s advertising business are subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. This includes seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup TM . The results for Sky’s content business are also subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in timing, nature and quantity of original programming distributed to other markets. Our revenue and operating costs and expenses (comprised of total costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense and other operating gains) are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, which affect our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments, and the Super Bowl, which affects our Broadcast Television segment. In particular, our advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time and our distribution revenue increases in the period of these broadcasts. Our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees. 25 Table of Contents Revenue in our Filmed Entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. Content licensing revenue in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees. Revenue in our Theme Parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions, as well as with changes in currency exchange rates. Our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the spring holiday period, the summer months when schools are closed and the holiday season. Exclusive tier one sports rights, such as domestic and UEFA Champions League soccer, Formula 1, and English cricket, play a key role within Sky’s wider content strategy. In Europe broadcasting rights for tier one sports are usually tendered through a competitive auction process, with the winning bidder or bidders acquiring rights over a three to five-year period. This creates some level of cyclicality for Sky, although the staggered timing of tier one sports rights auctions usually gives Sky time to react to any material changes in the competitive dynamics of the prevailing market.

Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section on page 37 for additional information, including our definition and our use of Adjusted EBITDA, and for a reconciliation from net income attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA. The comparability of our consolidated results of operations was impacted by the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018. Sky’s results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements following the October 9, 2018 acquisition date. Consolidated Revenue Our Sky, Cable Communications and Filmed Entertainment segments accounted for the increase in consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , which was partially offset by a decrease in revenue in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments. Consolidated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 included revenue associated with our broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and the 2018 Super Bowl in February 2018. 26 Table of Contents Revenue for our segments is discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Revenue for our business development initiatives and other businesses is discussed separately below under the heading “Corporate and Other Results of Operations.” Consolidated Costs and Expenses Our Sky and Cable Communications segments accounted for the increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2019 , which were partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses in our Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments. Operating costs and expenses for our segments are discussed separately below under the heading “Segment Operating Results.” Operating costs and expenses for our corporate operations, businesses development initiatives and other businesses are discussed separately below under the heading “Corporate and Other Results of Operations.” Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense Three Months Ended March 31 Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2019 2018 Cable Communications $ 2,035 $ 2,061 (1.3 )% NBCUniversal 515 510 1.0 Sky 741 — NM Corporate and Other 29 28 3.6 Total $ 3,320 $ 2,599 27.7 % Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense related to Sky. During the first quarter 2019, we recorded adjustments to the purchase price allocation of Sky, primarily related to intangible assets and property and equipment. This change resulted in an adjustment in the current period related to the fourth quarter of 2018 that increased depreciation and amortization expense by $53 million . Amortization expense from acquisition-related intangible assets, such as customer relationships, totaled $504 million and $205 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amounts primarily relate to customer relationship intangible assets recorded in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011 (see Note 6 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Sky transaction). Consolidated Interest Expense Interest expense increased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to increases in our debt outstanding associated with the financing of and debt assumed in connection with the Sky transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018. Consolidated Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ 262 $ (49 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 214 28 Other income (loss), net 200 147 Total $ 676 $ 126 Equity in Net Income (Losses) of Investees, Net The change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily related to our equity method investments in Atairos and Hulu. The income at Atairos was driven by fair value adjustments on its underlying investments. The loss at Hulu was primarily due to higher programming, advertising and marketing costs, and higher other administrative expenses. The equity in net income (losses) of Atairos and Hulu for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 are presented in the table below. 27 Table of Contents Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Atairos $ 374 $ 35 Hulu $ (141 ) $ (131 ) Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities, Net The change in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to unrealized gains of $162 million related to our investment in Snap. Other Income (Loss), Net The change in other income (loss), net for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily related to the recognition of the previously deferred gain related to Hulu of $159 million . See Note 9 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 8 to NBCUniversal’s condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. Consolidated Income Tax Expense Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 reflects an effective income tax rate that differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. The increase in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to higher taxable income from operations. We also recognized an income tax benefit of $128 million during the first quarter of 2018 related to the enactment of federal tax legislation in 2018. Segment Operating Results Our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. See Note 2 to both Comcast’s and NBCUniversal’s condensed consolidated financial statements for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation from the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable business segments to consolidated income before income taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, Comcast Cable’s wireless phone service and certain other Cable-related business development initiatives are now presented in the Cable Communications segment. Results were previously presented in Corporate and Other. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2018 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in the Sky segment. 28 Table of Contents Cable Communications Segment Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31 Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2019 2018 $ % Revenue Residential: High-speed internet $ 4,577 $ 4,157 $ 420 10.1 % Video 5,628 5,659 (31 ) (0.5 ) Voice 990 1,006 (16 ) (1.6 ) Wireless 225 185 40 21.4 Business services 1,891 1,726 165 9.5 Advertising 556 582 (26 ) (4.5 ) Other 413 388 25 7.0 Total revenue 14,280 13,703 577 4.2 Operating costs and expenses Programming 3,419 3,326 93 2.8 Technical and product support 1,880 1,856 24 1.3 Customer service 625 640 (15 ) (2.3 ) Advertising, marketing and promotion 972 978 (6 ) (0.6 ) Franchise and other regulatory fees 391 402 (11 ) (2.6 ) Other 1,265 1,284 (19 ) (1.6 ) Total operating costs and expenses 8,552 8,486 66 0.8 Adjusted EBITDA $ 5,728 $ 5,217 $ 511 9.8 % 29 Table of Contents Customer Metrics Net Additions March 31 Three Months Ended March 31 (in thousands) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Customer relationships Residential customer relationships 28,385 27,436 276 252 Business services customer relationships 2,327 2,208 25 29 Total customer relationships 30,712 29,645 300 281 Residential customer relationships mix One product customers 9,295 8,390 280 215 Two product customers 9,009 9,060 17 42 Three or more product customers 10,081 9,987 (22 ) (6 ) High-speed internet Residential customers 25,449 24,214 352 351 Business services customers 2,148 2,034 23 29 Total high-speed internet customers 27,598 26,249 375 379 Video Residential customers 20,852 21,210 (107 ) (93 ) Business services customers 1,014 1,051 (14 ) (3 ) Total video customers 21,865 22,261 (121 ) (96 ) Voice Residential customers 10,089 10,245 (63 ) (70 ) Business services customers 1,307 1,253 10 16 Total voice customers 11,396 11,498 (53 ) (54 ) Security and automation Security and automation customers 1,333 1,176 17 46 Wireless Wireless lines 1,405 577 170 196 Customer metrics are presented based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services. One product, two product, and three or more product customers represent residential customers that subscribe to one, two, or three or more of our cable services, respectively. For multiple dwelling units (“MDUs”), including buildings located on college campuses, whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (“HD”) or digital video recorder (“DVR”) advanced services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. In 2017, we began to offer prepaid services that allow customers to prepay for at least 30 days of service. Residential high-speed internet and video customers as of March 31, 2019 included prepaid customers totaling approximately 171,000 and 7,000, respectively. Wireless lines represent the number of activated eligible wireless devices on customers’ accounts. Individual customer relationships may have multiple wireless lines. Average monthly total revenue per customer relationship for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $155.75 and $154.82 , respectively. This metric is impacted by rate adjustments and changes in the types and levels of services received by our residential and business services customers, as well as changes in advertising revenue. While revenue from our high-speed internet, video, voice and wireless services is also impacted by changes in the allocation of revenue among services sold in a bundle, the allocation does not impact average monthly total revenue per customer relationship. Average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $62.48 and $58.94 , respectively. Each of our cable services has a different contribution to operating margin. We use average monthly Adjusted EBITDA per customer relationship to evaluate the profitability of our customer base across our service offerings. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services. Cable Communications Segment – Revenue High-Speed Internet High-speed internet revenue increased 10.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . An increase in the number of residential customers receiving our high-speed internet services accounted for an increase in revenue of 5.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . The remaining increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in average high-speed internet rates. 30 Table of Contents Video Video revenue was flat for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential video customers, which was partially offset by an increase in average video rates. We have experienced, and expect that we will continue to experience, declines in the number of residential video customers due to competitive pressures, and we expect that our video revenue will continue to decline. Competition is intense, both from traditional multichannel video providers and online video distribution services. We believe our X1 platform helps us compete more effectively against this competition, and have also continued to employ sales and marketing programs, such as promotions, bundled service offerings and service offerings targeted at specific market segments. Voice Voice revenue decreased 1.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to a decline in the number of residential voice customers. We expect that the number of residential voice customers and voice revenue will continue to decline. Wireless Wireless revenue increased 21.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines. Although customer lines increased, the number of wireless handsets sold declined in the period due to the number of customers electing to bring their own device. Business Services Business services revenue increased 9.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of customers receiving our small and medium-sized business services offerings and an increase in average rates. We believe the increases in the number of business customers are primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing. We expect that the contribution to our growth rate from medium-sized and enterprise customers will increase relative to that of our small-business customers as small business services matures. Advertising Advertising revenue decreased 4.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 , primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue. Excluding the impact of political advertising revenue, advertising decreased 1.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , 5% and 4% of our Cable Communications segment advertising revenue was generated from our NBCUniversal segments, respectively. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Other Other revenue increased 7.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to increases in revenue from our security and automation services and the licensing of our X1 platform to other multichannel video providers. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to increases in programming license fees, including sports programming costs and retransmission consent fees. Technical and product support expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . The increase was primarily due to expenses related to the continued development, deployment and support of our products and services and expenses related to the continued growth in business services, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our wireless phone service. This decrease reflects the decline in costs of handsets sold due to the number of customers electing to bring their own device, partially offset by an increase in variable network fees as a result of the increase in customer lines. Customer service expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to lower personnel costs as a result of reduced call volumes. Advertising, marketing and promotion expenses were flat for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 , reflecting the absence of advertising expenses associated with the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, offset by an increase in spending associated with attracting new customers. Franchise and other regulatory fees decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to a decrease in the revenue to which the fees apply. 31 Table of Contents Other operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased costs incurred in the prior year period as we continued to scale our wireless phone service. Cable Communications Segment – Operating Margin Our Cable Communications segment operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. The most significant operating costs and expenses for our Cable Communications segment are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers, which increased 2.8 % for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Our Cable Communications segment operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was 40.1% and 38.1% , respectively. We continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, particularly residential high-speed internet and business services, and on improving losses related to our wireless phone service and overall operating cost management. Losses from our wireless phone service were $103 million in the current year period compared to losses of $189 million in the prior year period.

Excluding $142 million of revenue associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, advertising revenue increased primarily due to higher prices for advertising units sold, partially offset by modest declines in audience ratings at our networks. For both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , 15% of our Cable Networks segment revenue was generated from our Cable Communications segment. These amounts are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above. Cable Networks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to decreases in programming and production costs and advertising, marketing, and promotion costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was primarily due to the absence of costs associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics. The decrease in advertising, marketing and promotion costs was due to the decrease in spending related to programming on our cable networks and our digital properties, and the absence of spending related to the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.

The increase in content licensing revenue was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available under licensing agreements. The increase in theatrical revenue was primarily due to the strong performances of several releases in our 2019 slate, including How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, Us and Glass , which were partially offset by successful performances of several releases in prior year period, including Fifty Shades Freed , Pacific Rim Uprising , Darkest Hour and Pitch Perfect 3. Home entertainment revenue increased primarily due to higher sales of 2019 releases, including Dr. Seuss ’ The Grinch , Halloween and Night School , which were partially offset by sales of 2018 releases in the prior year period, including American Made , Pitch Perfect 3 and Despicable Me 3. Filmed Entertainment Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to decreases in other operating and administrative costs due to the absence of expenses associated with the sale of a business in 2018 and a reduction in employee-related costs.

Theme Parks Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Theme Parks operating costs and expenses remained flat for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . Sky Segment Results of Operations The discussion below compares Sky’s actual results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 to pro forma results for Sky for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the Sky transaction occurred on January 1, 2017. Our pro forma data is also adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting and eliminating the costs and expenses directly related to the transaction, but does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined business. Pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the Sky business since January 1, 2017, nor of our future results. 35 Table of Contents Three Months Ended March 31 Actual Pro Forma Increase/ (Decrease) Constant Currency Growth (a) (in millions) 2019 2018 $ % % Revenue Direct-to-consumer $ 3,834 $ 4,132 $ (298 ) (7.2 )% (0.4 )% Content 370 286 84 29.5 38.0 Advertising 593 631 (38 ) (6.0 ) 0.7 Total revenue 4,797 5,049 (252 ) (5.0 ) 1.9 Operating costs and expenses Programming and production 2,301 2,261 40 1.8 9.3 Direct network costs 385 401 (16 ) (3.9 ) 2.6 Other 1,448 1,588 (140 ) (8.8 ) (2.2 ) Total operating costs and expenses 4,134 4,250 (116 ) (2.7 ) 4.4 Adjusted EBITDA $ 663 $ 799 $ (136 ) (17.0 )% (11.3 )% (a) Constant currency growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Commercial retail customers include hotels, bars, workplaces and restaurants with an active subscription for the purpose of providing Sky services to third party customers. We report commercial customers on a consistent basis based on the number of commercial agreements per venue in the U.K., a residential equivalent unit based upon the multiple of residential customer revenue in Italy and the number of active venues (bars and restaurants) or rooms (hotels and clinics) in Germany. Sky Segment – Revenue Direct-to-Consumer Direct-to-consumer revenue decreased 7.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct-to-consumer revenue was relatively consistent for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 , reflecting a decrease in average revenue per customer relationship, offset by an increase in customer relationships. Content Content revenue increased 29.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, content revenue increased 38.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to new sports programming licensing agreements, increased penetration of premium sports and movie channels on third party television networks and increased sales of original programming. Advertising Advertising revenue decreased 6.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, advertising revenue was flat for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 . Sky Segment – Operating Costs and Expenses Programming and Production Costs Programming and production costs increased 1.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, programming and production costs increased 9.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to new sports programming contracts in Italy and Germany. 36 Table of Contents Direct Network Costs Direct network costs decreased 3.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, direct network costs increased 2.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in costs associated with Sky’s wireless phone service as a result of an increase in the number of customers receiving the service. Other Other expenses decreased 8.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, other expenses decreased 2.2% for three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to a decrease in marketing costs. Corporate and Other Results of Operations Three Months Ended March 31 Increase/ (Decrease) (in millions) 2019 2018 $ % Revenue $ 108 $ 243 $ (135 ) (55.3 )% Operating costs and expenses 346 428 (82 ) (19.1 ) Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs (51 ) — (51 ) NM Adjusted EBITDA $ (187 ) $ (185 ) $ (2 ) (1.0 )% Corporate and Other – Revenue Other revenue primarily relates to revenue from Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Corporate and Other revenue decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in the second quarter of 2018. Corporate and Other – Operating Costs and Expenses Corporate and Other operating costs and expenses primarily include overhead, personnel costs, the costs of other business development initiatives, and operating costs and expenses associated with Comcast Spectacor. Corporate and Other operating costs and expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to the sale of a controlling interest in our arena management-related businesses in the second quarter of 2018, which was partially offset by transaction-related expenses directly related to the Sky transaction, including expenses resulting from the replacement of share-based compensation awards. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA excludes $51 million of transaction-related expenses. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. 37 Table of Contents We reconcile consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to Comcast Corporation. This measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income, net income, net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, or net cash provided by operating activities that we have reported in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation from Net Income Attributable to Comcast Corporation to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Net income attributable to Comcast Corporation $ 3,553 $ 3,118 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock 79 58 Income tax expense 1,076 818 Interest expense 1,150 777 Investment and other (income) loss, net (676 ) (126 ) Depreciation 2,240 2,011 Amortization 1,080 588 Adjustment for Sky transaction-related costs 51 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,553 $ 7,244 Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Sky, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Sky segment, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the business, and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the comparative period results in the prior year adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from the current year period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective prior year periods.

We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flows in repaying our debt obligations, funding our capital expenditures, investing in business opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. 38 Table of Contents Operating Activities Components of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Operating income $ 5,182 $ 4,645 Depreciation and amortization 3,320 2,599 Noncash share-based compensation 245 199 Changes in operating assets and liabilities (535 ) (1,005 ) Payments of interest (970 ) (854 ) Payments of income taxes (189 ) (162 ) Other 178 52 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,231 $ 5,474 The variance in changes in operating assets and liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics in the prior year period, the timing of film and television costs at Sky, including sports rights, and a reduction in Cable Communications wireless inventory, partially offset by our broadcast of the 2018 Super Bowl in prior year period. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for intangible assets and purchases of investments. Capital expenditures increased for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of spending at Sky and an increase in spending by our Theme Parks segment, partially offset by a decrease in spending by our Cable Communications segment due to lower spending on customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure. Purchases of investments for the three months ended March 31, 2019 consisted primarily of our cash capital contributions of $233 million to Hulu and $37 million to Atairos. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2019 consisted primarily of repayments of debt, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock under our employee plans. We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repayments of our term loans and repurchases or exchanges of our outstanding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. See Notes 5 and 6 to Comcast’s condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financing activities, including details of our debt repayments and borrowings. Available Borrowings Under Credit Facilities We also maintain significant availability under our lines of credit and commercial paper programs to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. As of March 31, 2019 , amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper programs and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $9.2 billion . Share Repurchases and Dividends Effective January 1, 2017, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $12 billion , which does not have an expiration date. Under the authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. We have paused our share repurchase program for 2019 in order to accelerate the reduction of indebtedness we incurred in connection with the acquisition of Sky and no common stock share repurchases were made under this authorization for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . We paid $247 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 related to employee taxes associated with the administration of our share-based compensation plans. In January 2019 , our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend to $0.84 per share on an annualized basis. In January 2019 , our Board of Directors approved our first quarter dividend of $0.21 per share to be paid in April 2019 . We expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our Board of Directors. On January 23, 2019, we paid dividends totaling $869 million. 39 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a more complete discussion of the accounting judgments and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS There have been no significant changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 5: OTHER INFORMATION Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act Disclosure Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, companies are required, among other things, to disclose certain activities, transactions or dealings with the Government of Iran or entities controlled directly or indirectly by the Government of Iran. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and are de minimis . As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing during the three months ended March 31, 2019 that requires disclosure under the Act, except with respect to the following: • Prior to our August 2016 acquisition of DreamWorks Animation, a non-U.S. subsidiary of DreamWorks Animation entered into a licensing agreement in January 2016 that licensed a prior season of a children’s animated television series for a three-year, non-cancelable term and for a one-time fee of $5,200 to a broadcasting company that is owned and controlled by the Government of Iran. The broadcasting company paid the license fee in the first quarter of 2016. We believe that DreamWorks Animation conducted its licensing activity in compliance with applicable laws and that the license is for the permissible exportation of informational materials pursuant to certain statutory and regulatory exemptions from U.S. sanctions. • Prior to our fourth quarter 2018 acquisition of Sky, a non-U.S. subsidiary of Sky entered into two licensing agreements that licensed some of Sky’s owned programming content to a broadcasting company that is owned and controlled by the Government of Iran. The first agreement was entered into in June 2012, and was amended in July 2016, to license 150 hours of programming content for various three-year license terms for a one-time fee of €86,250. The last remaining programming license under this agreement expired in January 2019. The second agreement was entered into in June 2015 to license 80 hours of programming content for various three-year license terms for a one-time fee of €45,700. To date, no programming content has been provided, and the license fee has not been paid, pursuant to the agreement. We believe that Sky conducted its licensing activity in compliance with applicable laws and that the licenses are for the permissible exportation of informational materials pursuant to certain statutory and regulatory exemptions from U.S. sanctions. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 6: EXHIBITS Comcast Exhibit No. Description 10.1* Form of Restricted Stock Unit Award and Long-Term Incentive Awards Summary Schedule under the Comcast Corporation 2002 Restricted Stock Plan. 31.1 Certification of Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 32.1 Certification of Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 101 The following financial statements from Comcast Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 25, 2019, formatted in XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language): (i) the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income; (ii) the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income; (iii) the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows; (iv) the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet; (v) the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity; and (vi) the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. * Constitutes a management contract or compensatory plan or arrangement.

NBCUniversal Media, LLC NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1: Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of Presentation Unless indicated otherwise, throughout these notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we refer to NBCUniversal and its consolidated subsidiaries as “we,” “us” and “our.” We have prepared these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements based on SEC rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements include all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for the periods shown, including normal, recurring accruals and other items. The consolidated results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). For a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and certain other information, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the notes within this Form 10-Q. See Note 6 for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Note 2: Segment Information We present our operations in four reportable business segments: Our Cable Networks segment consists primarily of our national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content, our regional sports and news networks, our international cable networks, our cable television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Broadcast Television segment consists primarily of the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks, our NBC and Telemundo owned local broadcast television stations, the NBC Universo national cable network, our broadcast television studio production operations, and various digital properties. Our Filmed Entertainment segment consists primarily of the operations of Universal Pictures, which produces, acquires, markets and distributes filmed entertainment worldwide; our films are also produced under the Illumination, DreamWorks Animation and Focus Features names. Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida; Hollywood, California; and Osaka, Japan. In addition, along with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies, we are developing a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments and the components of net income attributable to NBCUniversal excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are not separately evaluated. To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, 2018 operating results were reclassified related to certain NBCUniversal businesses now presented in Headquarters and Other. Our financial data by business segment is presented in the tables below. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (c) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Networks $ 2,868 $ 1,262 $ 182 $ 6 $ 2 Broadcast Television 2,467 387 39 13 3 Filmed Entertainment 1,768 364 19 4 5 Theme Parks 1,276 498 162 394 19 Headquarters and Other (a) 51 (164 ) 113 36 42 Eliminations (b) (85 ) — — — — Total $ 8,345 $ 2,347 $ 515 $ 453 $ 71 50 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 (in millions) Revenue Adjusted EBITDA (c) Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures Cash Paid for Intangible Assets Cable Networks (d) $ 3,157 $ 1,254 $ 189 $ 3 $ 4 Broadcast Television (d) 3,497 507 34 30 72 Filmed Entertainment 1,647 203 28 7 6 Theme Parks 1,281 495 155 182 16 Headquarters and Other (a) 51 (174 ) 104 47 32 Eliminations (b)(d) (103 ) — — — — Total $ 9,530 $ 2,285 $ 510 $ 269 $ 130 (a) Headquarters and Other activities include costs associated with overhead, allocations, personnel costs and headquarter initiatives. (b) Included in Eliminations are transactions that our segments enter into with one another, which consisted primarily of the licensing of film and television content from our Filmed Entertainment and Broadcast Television segments to our Cable Networks segment; for segment reporting, this revenue is recognized as the programming rights asset for the licensed content is amortized based on third party revenue. (c) We use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to NBCUniversal before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. Our reconciliation of the aggregate amount of Adjusted EBITDA for our reportable segments to consolidated income before income taxes is presented in the table below. Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,347 $ 2,285 Depreciation (243 ) (242 ) Amortization (272 ) (268 ) Interest expense (131 ) (127 ) Investment and other income (loss), net 240 (4 ) Income before income taxes $ 1,941 $ 1,644 (d) The revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics were reported in our Cable Networks and Broadcast Television segments.

Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet The following tables summarize our accounts receivable and other balances that are not separately presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheet that relate to the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash . (in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Receivables, gross $ 7,376 $ 7,392 Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts 106 99 Receivables, net $ 7,270 $ 7,293 (in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Noncurrent receivables, net (included in other noncurrent assets, net) $ 1,185 $ 1,180 Noncurrent deferred revenue (included in other noncurrent liabilities) $ 568 $ 481 52 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC Note 4: Long-Term Debt As of March 31, 2019 , our debt, excluding our revolving credit agreement with Comcast, had a carrying value of $13.1 billion and an estimated fair value of $13.7 billion . The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market values for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , Universal Beijing Resort borrowed $222 million under its debt financing agreement to fund the construction of a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (see Note 5). For the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we repaid $45 million of Universal Studios Japan term loans maturing 2022. Guarantee Structure We, Comcast and a 100% owned cable holding company subsidiary of Comcast (“CCCL Parent”) have fully and unconditionally guaranteed each other’s debt securities, including the $7.6 billion Comcast revolving credit facility due 2021. As of March 31, 2019 , $84.6 billion principal amount of outstanding debt securities of Comcast and CCCL Parent were subject to the cross-guarantee structure. We do not, however, guarantee the obligations of NBCUniversal Enterprise with respect to its $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, its revolving credit facility, its commercial paper program, nor its $725 million liquidation preference of Series A cumulative preferred stock. The Universal Studios Japan term loans are not subject to the cross-guarantee structure, however they have a separate guarantee from Comcast. The Universal Beijing Resort term loans are not guaranteed. Note 5: Significant Transactions Universal Beijing Resort We entered into an agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies to build and operate a Universal theme park and resort in Beijing, China (“Universal Beijing Resort”). We own a 30% interest in Universal Beijing Resort and the construction is being funded through a combination of debt financing and equity contributions from the investors in accordance with their equity interests. The debt financing, which is being provided by a syndicate of Chinese financial institutions, contains certain financial and operating covenants and a maximum borrowing limit of ¥ 26.6 billion RMB (approximately $4 billion ). The debt financing is secured by the assets of Universal Beijing Resort and the equity interests of the investors. As of March 31, 2019 , Universal Beijing Resort had $815 million principal amount of term loans outstanding under the debt financing agreements. We have concluded that Universal Beijing Resort is a variable interest entity based on its governance structure, and we consolidate it because we have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. There are no liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between us and Universal Beijing Resort, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our 30% interest. Universal Beijing Resort’s results of operations are reported in our Theme Parks segment. Our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows includes the costs of construction and related borrowings in the ""construction of Universal Beijing Resort"" and ""proceeds from borrowings"" captions, respectively, and equity contributions from our investing partner are included in other financing activities. In March 2018, Universal Beijing Resort received initial equity investments through a combination of cash and noncash contributions from the investors. As of March 31, 2019 , our condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets, primarily property and equipment, and liabilities, including the term loans, of Universal Beijing Resort totaling $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion , respectively. Note 6: Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The most significant change in the updated accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all operating leases with the exception of short-term leases. The standard also expands the disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For a lessee, the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease did not significantly change from previous guidance. We adopted the updated guidance on January 1, 2019 on a prospective basis and as a result, prior period amounts were not adjusted to reflect the impacts of the updated guidance. In addition, as permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, prior scoping and classification conclusions were carried forward for leases existing as of the adoption date. Upon adoption, we recorded approximately $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion of operating lease assets and liabilities, respectively, which includes the impact of fair value adjustments, prepaid rent and lease incentives. The adoption of the updated accounting guidance did not impact our recognition of finance leases, which were previously described as capital leases. As of the date of adoption, our 53 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC liabilities for finance leases were $332 million , which were recorded in long-term debt, and the related assets were recorded in property and equipment, net. Our finance leases were not considered material for further disclosure. The adoption of the new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 9 for further information. Film and Television Costs In March 2019, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to film and television costs. The updated guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television series with those of films, allowing for costs to be capitalized in excess of amounts of revenue contracted for each episode. The updated guidance also updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements for capitalized film and television costs, and requires impairment testing to be performed at a group level for capitalized film and television costs when the content is predominately monetized with other owned or licensed content. The updated guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, however we do not expect there to be a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. Note 7: Film and Television Costs (in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Film Costs: Released, less amortization $ 1,544 $ 1,600 Completed, not released 40 144 In production and in development 1,267 1,063 2,851 2,807 Television Costs: Released, less amortization 2,296 2,161 In production and in development 820 953 3,116 3,114 Programming rights, less amortization 2,638 2,694 8,605 8,615 Less: Current portion of programming rights 1,303 1,323 Film and television costs $ 7,302 $ 7,292 Note 8: Investments Investment and Other Income (Loss), Net Three Months Ended March 31 (in millions) 2019 2018 Equity in net income (losses) of investees, net $ (120 ) $ (100 ) Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net 161 37 Other income (loss), net 199 59 Investment and other income (loss), net $ 240 $ (4 ) (in millions) March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Equity method $ 831 $ 707 Marketable equity securities 324 162 Nonmarketable equity securities 912 811 Total investments $ 2,067 $ 1,680 Equity Method Hulu For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized our proportionate share of Hulu’s losses of $141 million and $131 million , respectively, in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we made cash capital contributions to Hulu totaling $233 million and $114 million , respectively. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment in Hulu was $341 million and $248 million , respectively. 54 Table of Contents NBCUniversal Media, LLC In August 2016, Time Warner Inc. acquired a 10% interest in Hulu, which diluted our interest in Hulu from 33% to 30% . Given the contingent nature of put and call options related to its shares, we recorded a deferred gain as a result of the dilution. In the first quarter of 2019, the put and call options expired unexercised and we recognized the previously deferred gain of $159 million in other income (loss), net. The Weather Channel In March 2018, we sold our investment in The Weather Channel cable network and recognized a pretax gain of $64 million in other income (loss), net. Marketable Equity Securities Snap For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized unrealized gains of $162 million and $37 million , respectively, in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, net related to our investment in Snap. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , our investment in Snap was $324 million and $162 million , respectively. Note 9: Supplemental Financial Information Leases Our leases consist primarily of real estate and equipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally utilize our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The lease asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives. Lease assets and liabilities are not recorded for leases with an initial term of one year or less. Lease expense for operating leases recorded in the balance sheet is included in operating costs and expenses and is based on the future minimum lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease plus any variable lease costs. Operating lease expenses, inclusive of short-term and variable lease expenses, recognized in our condensed consolidated statement of income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 were $111 million . These amounts do not include lease costs associated with production activities or other amounts capitalized in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, which are not material. The table below summarizes the operating lease assets and liabilities recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Additionally, through its employee stock purchase plans, employees are able to purchase shares of Comcast common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. Certain of our employees participate in these plans and the expense associated with their participation is settled in cash with Comcast.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 9 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 12, 2023. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2024. Allowance for Credit Losses—Client Receivables and Contract Assets As of November 30, 2023 and August 31, 2023, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 24,210 and $ 26,343 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: November 30, 2023 August 31, 2023 Equity method investments $ 23,778 $ 23,985 Investments without readily determinable fair values 174,296 173,458 Total non-current investments $ 198,074 $ 197,443 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net. Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 10 Depreciation and Amortization As of November 30, 2023 and August 31, 2023, total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,660,216 and $ 2,574,685 , respectively. See table below for a summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for the three months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Three Months Ended November 30, 2023 November 30, 2022 Depreciation $ 133,245 $ 144,049 Amortization - Deferred transition 98,491 70,440 Amortization - Intangible assets 111,631 109,069 Operating lease cost 175,014 180,502 Other 3,019 2,169 Total depreciation, amortization and other $ 521,400 $ 506,229 Business Optimization During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline our operations, transform our non-billable corporate functions and consolidate our office space to reduce costs. We recorded $ 1.1 billion in fiscal 2023 related to these actions and expect to record approximately $ 450 million in fiscal 2024 for a total of $ 1.5 billion, primarily related to employee severance. The actual amount and timing of severance and other personnel costs are dependent in part upon local country consultation processes and regulations and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. Total b usiness optimization costs by reportable operating segment for the three months ended November 30, 2023 were as follows: Three Months Ended November 30, 2023 North America $ 45,929 EMEA (1) 70,804 Growth Markets (1) 22,931 Total business optimization costs $ 139,664 (1) Effective September 1, 2023, we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of our Middle East and Africa market units from Growth Markets to Europe, and the Europe market is now referred to as our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) geographic market. New Accounting Pronouncement On December 14, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The ASU will be effective beginning with our annual fiscal 2026 financial statements and allows for adoption on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. We are in the process of assessing the impacts and method of adoption. This ASU will impact our income tax disclosures, but not our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 26 billion as of November 30, 2023 and August 31, 2023, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 60 % of our remaining performance obligations as of November 30, 2023 as revenue in fiscal 2024, an additional 20 % in fiscal 2025, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 634,981 and $ 653,954 as of November 30, 2023 and August 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 827,608 and $ 851,972 as of November 30, 2023 and August 31, 2023, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of November 30, 2023 As of August 31, 2023 Receivables $ 11,467,109 $ 10,690,713 Contract assets (current) 1,774,250 1,536,473 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 13,241,359 12,227,186 Contract assets (non-current) 121,563 106,994 Deferred revenues (current) 4,459,593 4,907,152 Deferred revenues (non-current) 634,981 653,954 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the three months ended November 30, 2023 were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2023 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2023 were $ 2.8 billion. Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2022 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2022 were $ 2.5 billion.

The income effect does not take into account “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - other,” since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.

Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next twelve months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 20,280 and $ 29,691 for the three months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: November 30, 2023 August 31, 2023 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 51,060 $ 52,995 Other non-current assets 40,640 44,739 Other Derivatives Other current assets 57,358 6,686 Total assets $ 149,058 $ 104,420 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 37,319 $ 50,020 Other non-current liabilities 18,952 26,076 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 12,252 38,645 Total liabilities $ 68,523 $ 114,741 Total fair value $ 80,535 $ ( 10,321 ) Total notional value $ 12,439,169 $ 13,390,031 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value.

Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2023 and 2022 were 23.2 % and 23.3 %, respectively. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of November 30, 2023 and August 31, 2023, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 1,929,000 and $ 1,793,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 52,000 and $ 51,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. As of November 30, 2023 and August 31, 2023, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 1,348,671 and $ 1,294,653 , respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of November 30, 2023, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, except as otherwise noted below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which we appealed. On August 17, 2023, the appeals court vacated the class certification and remanded the case to the district court for consideration of, among other things, the class action waiver signed by Starwood customer plaintiffs. On November 29, 2023, the district court reinstated the classes previously certified by the court in May 2022. We have filed a petition to appeal. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. After Accenture Federal Services (“AFS”) made a voluntary disclosure to the U.S. government, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) initiated a civil and criminal investigation concerning whether one or more employees provided inaccurate submissions to Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 18 an assessor who was evaluating on behalf of the U.S. government an AFS service offering and whether the service offering fully implemented required federal security controls. AFS is responding to an administrative subpoena and cooperating with DOJ’s investigation. This matter could subject us to adverse consequences as described under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023 – “Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment”. We cannot at this time determine when or how this matter will be resolved or estimate the cost or range of costs that are reasonably likely to be incurred in connection with this matter. 11. Segment Reporting Effective September 1, 2023, we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of our Middle East and Africa market units from Growth Markets to Europe, and the Europe market is now referred to as our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) geographic market. Prior period amounts below have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Our reportable segments are our three geographic markets, which are North America, EMEA and Growth Markets. Information regarding reportable segments, industry groups and type of work is as follows: Revenues Three Months Ended November 30, 2023 November 30, 2022 Geographic Markets North America $ 7,562,902 $ 7,622,820 EMEA 5,803,642 5,312,899 Growth Markets 2,857,759 2,812,083 Total Revenues $ 16,224,303 $ 15,747,802 Industry Groups Communications, Media & Technology $ 2,669,448 $ 2,980,203 Financial Services 3,033,578 2,963,396 Health & Public Service 3,377,466 3,000,019 Products 4,859,987 4,665,788 Resources 2,283,824 2,138,396 Total Revenues $ 16,224,303 $ 15,747,802 Type of Work Consulting $ 8,456,506 $ 8,444,367 Managed Services 7,767,797 7,303,435 Total Revenues $ 16,224,303 $ 15,747,802 Operating Income Three Months Ended November 30, 2023 November 30, 2022 Geographic Markets North America $ 1,256,708 $ 1,309,883 EMEA 823,601 726,883 Growth Markets 484,578 556,334 Total Operating Income $ 2,564,887 $ 2,593,100 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 19 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2024” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2024. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “aspires,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook,” “goal,” “target,” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not lim ited to those identified below. Business Risks • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key ecosystem partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 20 Financial Risks • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. Operational Risks • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and strategy to continue to grow in key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. Legal and Regulatory Risks • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2023. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 21 Overview Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific and Latin America). We combine our strength in technology and leadership in cloud, data and AI with unmatched industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services—creating tangible value at speed and scale. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending for smaller contracts with a shorter duration, especially for our consulting services. From an industry perspective, we are also experiencing reduced demand particularly in our Communications, Media & Technology industry group. Key Metrics Key metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023 are included below. We have presented operating margin and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or “adjusted” basis to exclude the impact of $140 million in business optimization costs. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” • Revenues of $16.2 billion, representing 3% growth in U.S. dollars and 1% growth in local currency; • New bookings of $18.4 billion, an increase of 14% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency; • Operating margin of 15.8%, compared to 16.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023; adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 16.7%; • Diluted earnings per share of $3.10, compared to $3.08 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023; adjusted earnings per share increased 6% to $3.27; and • Cash returned to shareholders of $2.0 billion, including share purchases of $1.2 billion and dividends of $810 million.

(1) Effective September 1, 2023, we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of our Middle East and Africa market units from Growth Markets to Europe, and the Europe market is now referred to as our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) geographic market. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 22 Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 1% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, revenue growth in local currency was solid in Growth Markets and modest in EMEA, partially offset by a slight decline in North America. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service, strong in Resources, slight in Products and flat in Financial Services, partially offset by a significant decline in Communications, Media & Technology. Revenue growth in local currency was solid in managed services, partially offset by a modest decline in consulting during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The business environment is competitive, and we have been experiencing lower pricing across the business. We define pricing as contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were flat in U.S. dollars and decreased 2% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The decline in consulting revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven by modest declines in North America and EMEA, while Growth Markets was flat. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. While we continue to experience demand for these services, we are seeing a slower pace and level of client spending, especially for smaller contracts with a shorter duration. In our managed services business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Managed services revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets and EMEA, while North America was flat. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and cybersecurity-as-a-service. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through technology, data and AI, and leveraging our digital platforms and talent to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1.5% higher than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2024, we estimate that our full fiscal 2024 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately equal to our revenue growth in local currency. People Metrics Utilization Workforce Annualized Voluntary Attrition 91% 743,000+ 11% consistent with the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to approximately 738,000 as of November 30, 2022 compared to 13% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 Utilization for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was 91%, consistent with the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 743,000 as of November 30, 2023, compared to approximately 738,000 as of November 30, 2022. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects people added in connection with acquisitions and hiring for specific skills. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 11%, down from 13% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation to provide market relevant pay based on the skills of our people and locations where we operate. We also consider a variety of factors, including the macroeconomic environment, in making our decisions around pay and benefits. We strive to adjust pricing as well as drive cost and delivery efficiencies, such as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin and contract profitability. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 23 Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees. Operating Expenses The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs such as facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was 33.6%, compared with 32.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with 16.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023, Sales and marketing costs increased 70 basis points due to higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal 2023, General and administrative costs decreased 20 basis points as a percentage of revenues. During the three months ended November 30, 2023, we recorded $140 million in business optimization costs, primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was 15.8%, compared with 16.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The business optimization costs recorded during the three months ended November 30, 2023 reduced operating margin by 90 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for the three months ended November 30, 2023 increased 20 basis points to 16.7%. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 23.2% and 23.3%, respectively. The business optimization costs of $140 million and related reduction in tax expense of $34 million for the three months ended November 30, 2023 had an immaterial impact on our effective tax rate. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $3.10 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, compared with $3.08 for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The $106 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.17 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $3.27 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP Financial Measures For fiscal 2024, we have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the business optimization costs, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior periods. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 New Bookings Three Months Ended Percent Increase (Decrease) U.S. Dollars Percent Increase (Decrease) Local Currency (in billions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2023 November 30, 2022 Consulting $ 8.6 $ 8.1 6 % 5 % Managed Services 9.8 8.1 21 19 Total New Bookings $ 18.4 $ 16.2 14 % 12 % We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023: Geographic Markets • North America revenues decreased 1% in local currency, due to declines in Communications & Media, Software & Platforms and Banking & Capital Markets. These decreases were partially offset by growth in Public Service. The decline in revenues was driven by the United States. • EMEA revenues increased 2% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service and Banking & Capital Markets. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Communications & Media. Revenue growth was driven by Italy, Austria and France, partially offset by a decline in the United Kingdom. • Growth Markets revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by growth in Chemicals & Natural Resources, Public Service, and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $505 million, or 4%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 84.2% compared to 83.5% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to business optimization costs of $140 million recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 26 Operating expenses by category are as follows: Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2023 November 30, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Operating Expenses $ 13,659 84.2 % $ 13,155 83.5 % $ 505 Cost of services 10,776 66.4 10,562 67.1 215 Sales and marketing 1,710 10.5 1,550 9.8 160 General and administrative costs 1,033 6.4 1,043 6.6 (10) Business optimization costs 140 0.9 — — 140 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Cost of Services Cost of services for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $215 million, or 2%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 66.4% from 67.1% during this period. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased as a percentage of revenues to 33.6% over 32.9% during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $160 million, or 10%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.5% over 9.8% during this period due to higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $10 million, or 1%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.4% from 6.6% during this period. Business Optimization Costs During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded business optimization costs of $140 million, primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $28 million, or 1%, from the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was 15.8%, compared with 16.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The business optimization costs reduced operating margin by 90 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 20 basis points to 16.7%. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended November 30, 2023 November 30, 2022 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 1,257 17 % $ 1,310 17 % $ (53) EMEA (1) 824 14 727 14 97 Growth Markets (1) 485 17 556 20 (72) Total $ 2,565 15.8 % $ 2,593 16.5 % $ (28) Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 27 Operating Income and Operating Margin Excluding Business Optimization Costs (Non-GAAP) Three Months Ended November 30, 2023 November 30, 2022 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income (GAAP) Business Optimization (1) Operating Income (Non-GAAP) Operating Margin (Non-GAAP) Operating Income (GAAP) Operating Margin (GAAP) Increase (Decrease) North America $ 1,257 $ 46 $ 1,303 17 % $ 1,310 17 % $ (7) EMEA (2) 824 71 894 15 727 14 168 Growth Markets (2) 485 23 508 18 556 20 (49) Total $ 2,565 $ 140 $ 2,705 16.7 % $ 2,593 16.5 % $ 111 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.

(2) Effective September 1, 2023, we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of our Middle East and Africa market units from Growth Markets to Europe, and the Europe market is now referred to as our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) geographic market. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by business optimization costs. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates where significant, for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2023: • North America operating income was relatively flat year-over-year as a decline in consulting revenue and lower contract profitability was offset by lower labor costs. • EMEA operating income increased primarily due to managed services revenue growth in local currency and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates which resulted in an increase in U.S. dollar revenues. • Growth Markets operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by lower contract profitability and an increase in selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. Interest Income Interest income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $102 million, an increase of $57 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher cash balances and interest rates. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 were 23.2% and 23.3%, respectively. The business optimization costs of $140 million and related reduction in tax expense of $34 million for the three months ended November 30, 2023 had an immaterial impact on our effective tax rate. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $3.10 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, compared with $3.08 for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The $106 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.17. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $3.27 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The increase in diluted earnings per share was due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share Q1 FY23 As Reported $ 3.08 Higher revenue and operating results 0.14 Higher non-operating income 0.05 Lower share count 0.01 Higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.01) Q1 FY24 As Adjusted $ 3.27 Business optimization costs (0.17) Q1 FY24 As Reported $ 3.10 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 28 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of November 30, 2023, Cash and cash equivalents was $7.1 billion, compared with $9.0 billion as of August 31, 2023. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Three months ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2023 November 30, 2022 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 499 $ 495 $ 3 Investing activities (855) (782) (73) Financing activities (1,552) (1,677) 125 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 5 (27) 31 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,904) $ (1,990) $ 86 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $3 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Investing activities: The $73 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $125 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in the net purchases of shares, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of November 30, 2023, we had the following borrowing facilities: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Credit Facilities Syndicated loan facility (1) $ 3,000 Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,873 Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 248 Total $ 5,122 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) This facility, which matures on April 24, 2026, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general corporate capital purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit and short-term commercial paper. Borrowings under this facility will accrue interest at the applicable risk-free rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of November 30, 2023, we had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding and backed by this facility, with a weighted-average effective interest rate of 5.4%. Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $1,099 million of letters of credit outstanding as of November 30, 2023. We also had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding as of November 30, 2023. The amount of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding reduces the available borrowing capacity under these facilities. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 29 Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the three months ended November 30, 2023 is as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Shares Amount Shares Amount Open-market share purchases (1) 3,439,438 $ 1,075 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 8,997 3 Other purchases (2) 370,495 113 — — Total 3,809,933 $ 1,188 8,997 $ 3 (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the three months ended November 30, 2023, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2024. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 3.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 11 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 12, 2022. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023. Allowance for Credit Losses—Client Receivables and Contract Assets As of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 26,770 and $ 25,786 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: May 31, 2023 August 31, 2022 Equity method investments $ 22,816 $ 164,164 Investments without readily determinable fair values 153,443 153,808 Total non-current investments $ 176,259 $ 317,972 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net. As of August 31, 2022, our equity method investments consisted primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. On March 30, 2023, Duck Creek Technologies was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $ 19.00 per share. As part of this transaction, we received proceeds of $ 400,355 and recorded a gain of $ 252,920 in Other income (expense), net during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

We recorded $ 346,873 and $ 591,263 of business optimization costs during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 , respectively, primarily for employee severance. Total b usiness optimization costs by reportable operating segment are as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended May 31, 2023 May 31, 2023 North America $ 96,349 $ 273,329 Europe 166,463 206,840 Growth Markets 84,061 111,094 Total business optimization costs $ 346,873 $ 591,263 We continue to expect to record total business optimization costs of approximately $ 1.5 billion related to these actions, with approximately $ 800 million in fiscal 2023 and $ 700 million in fiscal 2024. This consists of approximately $ 1.2 billion of employee severance and other personnel costs and $ 300 million of costs related to the consolidation of office space. The actual amount and timing of severance and other personnel costs are dependent in part upon local country consultation processes and regulations and may differ from our current expectations and estimates.

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 26 billion and $ 24 billion as of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 37 % of our remaining performance obligations as of May 31, 2023 as revenue in fiscal 2023, an additional 35 % in fiscal 2024, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 687,098 and $ 712,715 as of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 852,188 and $ 807,940 as of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of May 31, 2023 As of August 31, 2022 Receivables $ 11,005,863 $ 10,484,211 Contract assets (current) 1,576,797 1,292,564 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 12,582,660 11,776,775 Contract assets (non-current) 66,432 46,844 Deferred revenues (current) 5,101,692 4,478,048 Deferred revenues (non-current) 687,098 712,715 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the nine months ended May 31, 2023 were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022 were $ 2.7 billion and $ 3.7 billion, respectively. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2022 and August 31, 2021 were $ 2.5 billion and $ 3.5 billion, respectively.

Shareholders’ Equity Cancellation of Treasury Shares During the nine months ended May 31, 2023, we cancelled 8,828,496 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares that were held as treasury shares and had an aggregate cost of $ 2,595,281 . The effect of the cancellation of these treasury shares was recognized in Class A ordinary shares and Additional paid-in capital with the residual recorded in Retained earnings.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 18 8. Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 72,091 and $ 94,351 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023, respectively, and net losses of $ 31,285 and $ 67,812 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: May 31, 2023 August 31, 2022 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 56,648 $ 89,867 Other non-current assets 39,624 69,209 Other Derivatives Other current assets 6,986 8,657 Total assets $ 103,258 $ 167,733 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 54,887 $ 61,156 Other non-current liabilities 25,743 42,537 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 90,903 83,792 Total liabilities $ 171,533 $ 187,485 Total fair value $ ( 68,275 ) $ ( 19,752 ) Total notional value $ 13,373,535 $ 11,095,604 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: May 31, 2023 August 31, 2022 Net derivative assets $ 46,349 $ 140,073 Net derivative liabilities 114,624 159,825 Total fair value $ ( 68,275 ) $ ( 19,752 ) Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 19 9. Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022 were 22.2 % and 27.1 %, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2023 was primarily due to lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, the tax impact from an investment gain and higher benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022 were 22.1 % and 23.8 %, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 was primarily due to lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, higher benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities and the tax impact from an investment gain, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based payments. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 1,750,000 and $ 1,349,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 51,000 and $ 49,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. As of May 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 1,239,648 and $ 1,116,298 , respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of May 31, 2023, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which we are appealing. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May 3, 2023. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2023” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2023. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “aspires,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook,” “goal,” “target,” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not lim ited to those identified below. Business Risks • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and disclosures may expose us to reputational risks and legal liability. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key ecosystem partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 22 Financial Risks • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. Operational Risks • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and strategy to continue to grow in key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. Legal and Regulatory Risks • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 23 Overview Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology with industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services—creating tangible value at speed and scale. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business. These conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending for smaller contracts with a shorter duration, especially for our consulting services. From an industry perspective, we are also experiencing reduced demand particularly in our Communications, Media & Technology industry group. Key Metrics Key metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022 are included below. We have presented operating margin and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or “adjusted” basis to exclude the impact of $347 million in business optimization costs and, with respect to diluted earnings per share, the impact of a $253 million investment gain recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” • Revenues of $16.6 billion, representing 3% growth in U.S. dollars and 5% growth in local currency; • New bookings of $17.2 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency; • Operating margin of 14.2%, compared to 16.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022; adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 16.3%; • Diluted earnings per share of $3.15, compared to $2.79 in the third quarter of fiscal 2022; adjusted earnings per share increased 14% to $3.19; and • Cash returned to shareholders of $1.5 billion, including share purchases of $789 million and dividends of $708 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2022. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, revenue growth in local currency was strong in Growth Markets and Europe and modest in North America. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service and Resources, strong in Products and solid in Financial Services, partially offset by a decline in Communications, Media & Technology. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in managed services, partially offset by a slight decline in consulting during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, was lower in some areas of our business. In our consulting business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Consulting revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 4% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2022. The decline in consulting revenue in local currency for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was driven by a modest decline in North America, partially offset by modest growth in Growth Markets, while Europe was flat. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. While we continue to experience demand for these services, we are seeing a slower pace and level of client spending, especially for smaller contracts with a shorter duration. In our managed services business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Managed services revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2022. Managed services revenue in local currency for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets and Europe and strong growth in North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2.5% and 5.5% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2023, we estimate that our full fiscal 2023 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. People Metrics Utilization Workforce Annualized Voluntary Attrition 91% 732,000 13% consistent with the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to approximately 710,000 as of May 31, 2022 compared to 20% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 Utilization for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was 91%, consistent with the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 732,000 as of May 31, 2023, compared to approximately 710,000 as of May 31, 2022. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects people added in connection with acquisitions and hiring for specific skills. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 13%, down from 20% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 In addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases became effective December 1 st of fiscal 2023. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has increased faster than in prior years. We strive to adjust pricing as well as drive cost and delivery efficiencies, such as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin and contract profitability. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees. Operating Expenses The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on managed services contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was 33.4%, compared with 32.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 was 32.3% compared with 32.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2022. The increase in gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and nine months ended May 31, 2023 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 17.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 16.8% for the nine months ended May 31, 2023, compared with 16.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and 16.6% for the nine months ended May 31, 2022. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and nine months ended May 31, 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, Sales and marketing costs increased 20 and 30 basis points, respectively, due to higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and nine months ended May 31, 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, General and administrative costs were flat and decreased 10 basis points, respectively, as a percentage of revenues. During the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023, we recorded $347 million and $591 million in business optimization costs, respectively, primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was 14.2%, compared with 16.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 was 14.3%, compared with 15.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2022. The business optimization costs recorded during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 reduced operating margin by 210 and 130 basis points, respectively. Excluding these costs, operating margin for both the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 increased 20 basis points to 16.3% and 15.6%, respectively. Other Income (Expense), net During the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023, we recorded a gain of $253 million related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 22.2% and 27.1%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022 were 22.1% and 23.8%, respectively. Absent the business optimization costs of $347 million and $591 million and related reduction in tax expense of $80 million and $132 million, as well as an investment gain of $253 million and related tax expense of $9 million, our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2023 were 24.0% and 22.7%, respectively. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $3.15 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with $2.79 for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Diluted earnings per share were $8.62 for the nine months ended May 31, 2023, compared with $8.11 for the nine months ended May 31, 2022. The $267 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.42 and the $244 million investment gain, net of related taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.38 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $3.19 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The $459 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.72 and the $244 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 26 million investment gain, net of related taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.38 for the nine months ended May 31, 2023. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $8.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2023. Non-GAAP Financial Measures For fiscal 2023, we have presented effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share excluding the business optimization costs and investment gain, as well as operating income and operating margin excluding the business optimization costs, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior periods. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.

Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 2% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service for our U.S. federal business, Health and Utilities. These increases were partially offset by declines in Communications & Media, High Tech, Software & Platforms and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Industrial and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Italy, Germany and France. • Growth Markets revenues increased 9% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Chemicals & Natural Resources and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was led by Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $650 million, or 5%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 85.8% compared to 83.9% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to business optimization costs of $347 million recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 28 Operating expenses by category are as follows: Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) May 31, 2023 May 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Operating Expenses $ 14,205 85.8 % $ 13,556 83.9 % $ 650 Cost of services 11,036 66.6 10,844 67.1 191 Sales and marketing 1,739 10.5 1,661 10.3 78 General and administrative costs 1,084 6.5 1,051 6.5 34 Business optimization costs 347 2.1 — — 347 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.

Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased as a percentage of revenues to 33.4% over 32.9% during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $78 million, or 5%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.5% over 10.3% during this period due to higher selling and other business development costs. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $34 million, or 3%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2022, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 6.5% during this period. Business Optimization Costs During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $347 million, primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased $244 million, or 9%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was 14.2%, compared with 16.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The business optimization costs reduced operating margin by 210 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 20 basis points to 16.3%. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended May 31, 2023 May 31, 2022 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 1,241 16 % $ 1,380 18 % $ (139) Europe 632 11 694 13 (62) Growth Markets 486 15 530 17 (43) Total $ 2,359 14.2 % $ 2,603 16.1 % $ (244) Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. In addition, during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by business optimization costs. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2022: • North America operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by lower consulting contract profitability as well as higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by an increase in selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. Interest Income Interest income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $82 million, an increase of $73 million over the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, other income (expense), net increased $211 million over the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher gains on investments. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Loss on Disposition of Russia Business We recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 22.2% and 27.1%, respectively. Absent the business optimization costs of $347 million and related reduction in tax expense of $80 million, and the investment gain of $253 million and related tax expense of $9 million, our effective tax rate was 24.0% for the three months ended May 31, 2023. The lower effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and higher benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $3.15 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with $2.79 for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The $267 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.42 and the $244 million investment gain, net of related taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.38 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $3.19 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2022: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 6% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service for our U.S. federal business, Health and Utilities. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Communications & Media. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by growth in Industrial, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, Italy and France. • Growth Markets revenues increased 14% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Public Service and Chemicals & Natural Resources. Revenue growth was led by Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 increased $2,158 million, or 6%, compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 85.7% compared to 84.6% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to business optimization costs of $591 million recorded during the nine months ended May 31, 2023. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 32 Operating expenses by category are as follows: Nine Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) May 31, 2023 May 31, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Operating Expenses $ 41,230 85.7 % $ 39,072 84.6 % $ 2,158 Cost of services 32,577 67.7 31,415 68.0 1,161 Sales and marketing 4,852 10.1 4,530 9.8 322 General and administrative costs 3,210 6.7 3,126 6.8 83 Business optimization costs 591 1.2 — — 591 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Cost of Services Cost of services for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 increased $1,161 million, or 4%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 67.7% from 68.0% during this period. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 increased to 32.3% over 32.0% during the nine months ended May 31, 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 increased $322 million, or 7%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.1% over 9.8% during this period due to higher selling and other business development costs. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 increased $83 million, or 3%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.7% from 6.8% during this period. Business Optimization Costs During the nine months ended May 31, 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $591 million, primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 decreased $202 million, or 3%, compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2022. Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 was 14.3%, compared with 15.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2022. The business optimization costs reduced operating margin by 130 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 increased 20 basis points to 15.6%. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Nine Months Ended May 31, 2023 May 31, 2022 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 3,375 15 % $ 3,715 17 % $ (340) Europe 1,895 12 1,970 13 (75) Growth Markets 1,627 17 1,414 16 213 Total $ 6,897 14.3 % $ 7,099 15.4 % $ (202) Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the nine months ended May 31, 2023 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. In addition, during the nine months ended May 31, 2023 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by business optimization costs. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates where significant, for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2022: • North America operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs, including an increase in selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased due to revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Income Interest income for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 was $177 million, an increase of $155 million over the nine months ended May 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the nine months ended May 31, 2023, other income (expense), net increased $176 million over the nine months ended May 31, 2022, primarily due to higher gains on investments, partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements."" Loss on Disposition of Russia Business We recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during the nine months ended May 31, 2022. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 and 2022 were 22.1% and 23.8%, respectively. Absent the business optimization costs of $591 million and related reduction in tax expense of $132 million, and the investment gain of $253 million and related tax expense of $9 million, our effective tax rate was 22.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2023. The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2023 was primarily due to lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and higher benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based payments. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $8.62 for the nine months ended May 31, 2023, compared with $8.11 for the nine months ended May 31, 2022. The $459 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.72 and the $244 million investment gain, net of related taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.38 for the nine months ended May 31, 2023. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $8.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2023. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 34 The increase in diluted earnings per share was due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share FY22 As Reported $ 8.11 Higher revenue and operating results 0.46 Loss on disposition of Russia business recorded in fiscal 2022 0.15 Higher non-operating income (excluding loss on disposition of Russia business) 0.10 Lower effective tax rate (excluding loss on disposition of Russia business) 0.09 Lower share count 0.07 Higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.02) FY23 As Adjusted $ 8.96 Gain on an investment, net of tax 0.38 Business optimization costs (0.72) FY23 As Reported $ 8.62 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 35 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, 2023, Cash and cash equivalents was $8.5 billion, compared with $7.9 billion as of August 31, 2022. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Nine Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) May 31, 2023 May 31, 2022 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 6,115 $ 5,751 $ 364 Investing activities (1,255) (2,852) 1,597 Financing activities (4,165) (4,210) 45 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (49) (154) 105 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 646 $ (1,465) $ 2,110 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $364 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income as well as higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, contract assets and deferred revenues), partially offset by higher spending on certain compensation payments. Investing activities: The $1,597 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and higher proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $45 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in net proceeds from share issuances, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of May 31, 2023, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility $ 3,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,755 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 246 — Total $ 5,001 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $1,028 million of letters of credit outstanding as of May 31, 2023. We have a short-term commercial paper financing program backed by our $3 billion syndicated credit facility. As of May 31, 2023, we had no commercial paper outstanding.

These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the nine months ended May 31, 2023, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2023. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above.

(4) During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Accenture purchased 180,978 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 11 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 12, 2022. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023. Allowance for Credit Losses—Client Receivables and Contract Assets As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 25,737 and $ 25,786 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: February 28, 2023 August 31, 2022 Equity method investments $ 168,812 $ 164,164 Investments without readily determinable fair values 156,439 153,808 Total non-current investments $ 325,251 $ 317,972 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net. Our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. As of February 28, 2023, the carrying amount of our investment was $ 143,700 , and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16 % ownership was $ 400,355 . We account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship. On January 9, 2023, Duck Creek Technologies announced an agreement to be acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $ 19.00 per share. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 12 Depreciation and Amortization As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,694,138 and $ 2,490,187 , respectively. See table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Three Months Ended Six Months Ended February 28, 2023 February 28, 2022 February 28, 2023 February 28, 2022 Depreciation $ 137,742 $ 149,872 $ 281,791 $ 288,665 Amortization - Deferred transition 85,160 68,331 155,600 135,537 Amortization - Intangible assets 120,212 115,831 229,281 218,373 Operating lease cost 184,226 192,869 364,728 383,111 Other 5,136 1,357 7,305 3,439 Total depreciation, amortization and other $ 532,476 $ 528,260 $ 1,038,705 $ 1,029,125 Business Optimization During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline our operations, transform our non-billable corporate functions and consolidate our office space to reduce costs. We expect to record total business optimization costs of approximately $ 1.5 billion related to these actions, with approximately $ 800 million in fiscal 2023 and $ 700 million in fiscal 2024. This consists of approximately $ 1.2 billion of employee severance and other personnel costs, of which we expect to incur $ 500 million in fiscal 2023 and the remaining $ 700 million in fiscal 2024. The actual amount and timing of costs are dependent in part upon local country consultation processes and regulations and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. Additionally, we expect to incur $ 300 million of costs related to the consolidation of office space, the majority of which is expected to be recorded in fiscal 2023. We recorded $ 244,390 of business optimization costs during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily for employee severance. Total business optimization costs for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 were $ 176,980 for North America, $ 40,377 for Europe and $ 27,033 for Growth Markets.

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 27 billion and $ 24 billion as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 52 % of our remaining performance obligations as of February 28, 2023 as revenue in fiscal 2023, an additional 24 % in fiscal 2024, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 726,092 and $ 712,715 as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 850,522 and $ 807,940 as of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of February 28, 2023 As of August 31, 2022 Receivables $ 10,997,530 $ 10,484,211 Contract assets (current) 1,501,638 1,292,564 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 12,499,168 11,776,775 Contract assets (non-current) 75,423 46,844 Deferred revenues (current) 5,112,570 4,478,048 Deferred revenues (non-current) 726,092 712,715 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the six months ended February 28, 2023 were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022 were $ 2.5 billion and $ 3.3 billion, respectively. Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2021 and August 31, 2021 were $ 2.3 billion and $ 3.2 billion, respectively.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 18 8. Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net gains of $ 7,431 and net losses of $ 22,260 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively, and net losses of $ 13,048 and $ 36,527 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2022, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: February 28, 2023 August 31, 2022 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 51,224 $ 89,867 Other non-current assets 36,255 69,209 Other Derivatives Other current assets 8,002 8,657 Total assets $ 95,481 $ 167,733 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 70,908 $ 61,156 Other non-current liabilities 31,003 42,537 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 42,979 83,792 Total liabilities $ 144,890 $ 187,485 Total fair value $ ( 49,409 ) $ ( 19,752 ) Total notional value $ 11,874,339 $ 11,095,604 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: February 28, 2023 August 31, 2022 Net derivative assets $ 38,490 $ 140,073 Net derivative liabilities 87,899 159,825 Total fair value $ ( 49,409 ) $ ( 19,752 ) Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 19 9. Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 were 20.4 % and 19.2 %, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2023 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments, partially offset by lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings. Our effective tax rate for both the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 was 22.0 %. The business optimization costs of $ 244,390 and related reduction in tax expense of $ 51,515 did not significantly impact our effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 or six months ended February 28, 2023. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 1,638,000 and $ 1,349,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 50,000 and $ 49,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. As of February 28, 2023 and August 31, 2022, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 1,143,983 and $ 1,116,298 , respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of February 28, 2023, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which we are appealing. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 21 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2023” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2023. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “aspires,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook,” “goal,” “target,” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not lim ited to those identified below. Business Risks • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and disclosures may expose us to reputational risks and legal liability. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key ecosystem partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 22 Financial Risks • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. Operational Risks • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and strategy to continue to grow in key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. Legal and Regulatory Risks • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022. In addition, the timing and amount of costs related to our business optimization actions and the nature and extent of benefits realized from such actions are subject to uncertainties and other factors, including local country consultation processes and regulations, and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 23 Overview Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology with industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services—creating tangible value at speed and scale. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business, particularly with regard to wage inflation and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. In some cases, these conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending. Key Metrics We saw strong demand across our business in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Key metrics for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 are included below. We have presented operating margin and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or “adjusted” basis to exclude the impact of $244 million in business optimization costs recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” • Revenues of $15.8 billion, representing 5% growth in U.S. dollars and 9% growth in local currency; • New bookings of $22.1 billion, an increase of 13% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency; • Operating margin of 12.3%, compared to 13.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022; adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 13.8%; • Diluted earnings per share of $2.39, compared to $2.54 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022; adjusted earnings per share increased 6% to $2.69; and • Cash returned to shareholders of $1.8 billion, including share purchases of $1.1 billion and dividends of $708 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2023 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Growth Markets and Europe and solid in North America. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Resources, Health & Public Service and Financial Services, strong in Products and flat in Communications, Media & Technology. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in managed services and solid in consulting during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, was relatively stable. In our consulting business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 4% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Consulting revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2023 were flat in U.S. dollars and increased 7% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022. Consulting revenue growth in local currency for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was very strong in Growth Markets, solid in Europe and flat in North America. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. In our managed services business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 12% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Managed services revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2023 increased 12% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2022. Managed services revenue in local currency for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was driven by very strong growth in Europe, Growth Markets and North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2023 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2022, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% and 7% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2023, we estimate that our full fiscal 2023 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.5% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. People Metrics Utilization Workforce Annualized Voluntary Attrition 91% 738,000+ 12% compared to 92% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to approximately 699,000 as of February 28, 2022 compared to 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 Utilization for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 91%, compared to 92% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 738,000 as of February 28, 2023, compared to approximately 699,000 as of February 28, 2022. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions. While we continue to hire, especially to support our strategic growth priorities, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated actions to streamline our operations and transform our non-billable corporate functions to reduce costs. Over the next 18 months, these actions are expected to result in the departure of approximately 19,000 people (or 2.5% of our current workforce), and we expect over half of these departures will consist of people in our non-billable corporate functions. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 12%, down from 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases become effective December 1 st of each fiscal year. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has been and continues to increase faster than in prior years. We strive to adjust pricing as well as drive cost and delivery efficiencies, such as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin and contract profitability. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees. Operating Expenses The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on managed services contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 30.6%, compared with 30.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was 31.7% compared with 31.5% for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel. The increase in gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 16.6% for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared with 16.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 16.5% for the six months ended February 28, 2022. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, Sales and marketing costs increased 50 and 30 basis points, respectively. The increase in Sales and marketing for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023 was due to higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, General and administrative costs decreased 20 basis points as a percentage of revenues. During the three and six months ended February 28, 2023, we recorded $244 million in business optimization costs, primarily for employee severance. As part of these business optimization initiatives, we expect to record total costs of approximately $1.5 billion, with approximately $800 million in fiscal 2023 and $700 million in fiscal 2024. The $1.5 billion is expected to consist of $1.2 billion of employee severance and other personnel costs and $300 million related to the consolidation of office space. The actual amount and timing of costs are dependent in part upon local country consultation processes and regulations and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 12.3%, compared with 13.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was 14.4%, compared with 15.0% for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The business optimization costs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased operating margin by 150 and 80 basis points for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively. Excluding these costs, operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023 increased 10 and 20 basis points to 13.8% and 15.2%, respectively. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 20.4% and 19.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate for both the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 was 22.0%. The business optimization costs of $244 million and related reduction in tax expense of $52 million did not significantly impact our effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 or six months ended February 28, 2023. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 26 Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.39 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with $2.54 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Diluted earnings per share were $5.47 for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared with $5.32 for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The $193 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.30 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023. Excluding these impacts, diluted earnings per share were $2.69 and $5.77 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and six months ended February 28, 2023, respectively. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rates and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2023, excluding the impact of the business optimization costs, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.

Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Health and Utilities. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Communications & Media and High Tech. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 12% in local currency, led by growth in Industrial, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, Italy and France. • Growth Markets revenues increased 14% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Chemicals & Natural Resources and Public Service. Revenue growth was led by Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $884 million, or 7%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 87.7% compared to 86.3% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to business optimization costs of $244 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 28 Operating expenses by category are as follows: Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) February 28, 2023 February 28, 2022 Increase (Decrease) Operating Expenses $ 13,870 87.7 % $ 12,985 86.3 % $ 884 Cost of services 10,979 69.4 10,523 69.9 457 Sales and marketing 1,564 9.9 1,415 9.4 149 General and administrative costs 1,082 6.8 1,048 7.0 35 Business optimization costs 244 1.5 — — 244 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Cost of Services Cost of services for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $457 million, or 4%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.4% from 69.9% during this period. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased as a percentage of revenues to 30.6% over 30.1% during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $149 million, or 11%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 9.9% over 9.4% during this period due to higher selling and other business development costs. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $35 million, or 3%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.8% from 7.0% during this period. Business Optimization Costs During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $244 million, primarily for employee severance. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased $117 million, or 6%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was 12.3%, compared with 13.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The business optimization costs decreased operating margin by 150 basis points. Excluding these costs, operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 10 basis points to 13.8%. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended February 28, 2023 February 28, 2022 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 824 11 % $ 1,091 15 % $ (267) Europe 574 11 532 11 42 Growth Markets 547 18 439 15 108 Total $ 1,945 12.3 % $ 2,062 13.7 % $ (117) Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by business optimization costs. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2022: • North America operating income decreased as managed services revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs, including an increase in selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased due to revenue growth. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and revenue growth. Interest Income Interest income for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $50 million, an increase of $43 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, other income (expense), net increased $29 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 20.4% and 19.2%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments, partially offset by lower tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings. The business optimization costs of $244 million and related reduction in tax expense of $52 million did not significantly impact our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.39 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with $2.54 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The $193 million of business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.30 during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding this impact, diluted earnings per share were $2.69 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2023 increased to 31.7% over 31.5% during the six months ended February 28, 2022. The increase in gross margin was due to lower labor costs, including lower subcontractor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2022.

General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the six months ended February 28, 2023 increased $50 million, or 2%, over the six months ended February 28, 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.7% from 6.9%. Business Optimization Costs During the six months ended February 28, 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $244 million, primarily for employee severance.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the six months ended February 28, 2023 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. In addition, during the six months ended February 28, 2023 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by business optimization costs. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates where significant, for the six months ended February 28, 2023 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2022: • North America operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs, including an increase in selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased due to revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Income Interest income for the six months ended February 28, 2023 was $95 million, an increase of $82 million over the six months ended February 28, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the six months ended February 28, 2023, other income (expense), net increased $35 million over the six months ended February 28, 2022, primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements."" Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for both the six months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022 was 22.0%. The business optimization costs of $244 million and related reduction in tax expense of $52 million did not significantly impact our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2023. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2023 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%, and adjusted annual effective tax rate, which excludes the tax impacts of business optimization costs and an anticipated investment gain, to be in the range of 23% to 25%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $5.47 for the six months ended February 28, 2023, compared with $5.32 for the six months ended February 28, 2022. The $193 million business optimization costs, net of related taxes, decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.30 during the six months ended February 28, 2023. Excluding this impact, diluted earnings per share were $5.77 for the six months ended February 28, 2023.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 34 The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share FY22 As Reported $ 5.32 Higher revenue and operating results 0.35 Higher non-operating income 0.06 Lower share count 0.05 Higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.01) FY23 As Adjusted $ 5.77 Business optimization costs (0.30) FY23 As Reported $ 5.47 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 35 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of February 28, 2023, Cash and cash equivalents was $6.2 billion, compared with $7.9 billion as of August 31, 2022. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Six Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) February 28, 2023 February 28, 2022 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,826 $ 2,686 $ 139 Investing activities (1,260) (2,185) 925 Financing activities (3,192) (3,106) (86) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (24) (97) 73 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,651) $ (2,702) $ 1,051 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $139 million increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income as well as higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, contract assets and deferred revenues), partially offset by higher spending on certain compensation payments. Investing activities: The $925 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $86 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of February 28, 2023, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility $ 3,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,708 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 243 — Total $ 4,951 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $912 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 28, 2023. We have a short-term commercial paper financing program backed by our $3 billion syndicated credit facility. As of February 28, 2023, we had no commercial paper outstanding.

Our share purchase activity during the six months ended February 28, 2023 is as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Shares Amount Shares Amount Open-market share purchases (1) 6,989,255 $ 1,910 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 7,935 2 Other purchases (2) 2,305,789 624 — — Total 9,295,044 $ 2,535 7,935 $ 2 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the six months ended February 28, 2023, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2023. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 3.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 9 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 12, 2022. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2023. Allowance for Credit Losses—Client Receivables and Contract Assets As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 24,617 and $ 25,786 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022 Equity method investments $ 166,360 $ 164,164 Investments without readily determinable fair values 158,022 153,808 Total non-current investments $ 324,382 $ 317,972 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net. Our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. As of November 30, 2022, the carrying amount of our investment was $ 141,960 , and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16 % ownership was $ 209,851 . We account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship.

See table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 25 billion and $ 24 billion as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 61 % of our remaining performance obligations as of November 30, 2022 as revenue in fiscal 2023, an additional 18 % in fiscal 2024, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 710,017 and $ 712,715 as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 832,653 and $ 807,940 as of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.

Shareholders’ Equity Cancellation of Treasury Shares During the three months ended November 30, 2022, we cancelled 8,828,496 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares that were held as treasury shares and had an aggregate cost of $ 2,595,281 . The effect of the cancellation of these treasury shares was recognized in Class A ordinary shares and Additional paid-in capital with the residual recorded in Retained earnings. There was no effect on total shareholders’ equity as a result of this cancellation. Dividends Our dividend activity during the three months ended November 30, 2022 is as follows: Dividend Per Share Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 16 8. Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 29,691 and $ 23,479 for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 61,110 $ 89,867 Other non-current assets 54,177 69,209 Other Derivatives Other current assets 44,147 8,657 Total assets $ 159,434 $ 167,733 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 77,023 $ 61,156 Other non-current liabilities 34,649 42,537 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 5,562 83,792 Total liabilities $ 117,234 $ 187,485 Total fair value $ 42,200 $ ( 19,752 ) Total notional value $ 10,646,500 $ 11,095,604 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: November 30, 2022 August 31, 2022 Net derivative assets $ 90,380 $ 140,073 Net derivative liabilities 48,180 159,825 Total fair value $ 42,200 $ ( 19,752 ) Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 17 9. Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 were 23.3 % and 24.4 %, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2022 was primarily due to lower tax expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 1,519,000 and $ 1,349,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 64,000 and $ 49,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. As of November 30, 2022 and August 31, 2022, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 1,105,624 and $ 1,116,298 , respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of November 30, 2022, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which we are appealing. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 19 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2023” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2023. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “aspires,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook,” “goal,” “target,” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not lim ited to those identified below. Business Risks • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to match people and their skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • Our environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments and disclosures may expose us to reputational risks and legal liability. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key ecosystem partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 20 Financial Risks • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. Operational Risks • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and strategy to continue to grow in key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. Legal and Regulatory Risks • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 21 Overview Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions across Strategy & Consulting, Technology, Operations, Industry X and Song. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We combine our strength in technology with industry experience, functional expertise and global delivery capability to help the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations build their digital core, optimize their operations, accelerate revenue growth and enhance citizen services—creating tangible value at speed and scale. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, the overall inflationary environment and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which has impacted and may continue to impact our business, particularly with regard to wage inflation and increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. In some cases, these conditions have slowed the pace and level of client spending. Key Metrics We saw strong demand across our business in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as our clients continue their digital transformations. Key metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 included: • Revenues of $15.7 billion, representing 5% growth in U.S. dollars and 15% growth in local currency; • New bookings of $16.2 billion, a decrease of 3% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 6% in local currency; • Operating margin of 16.5%, a 20 basis point expansion; • Diluted earnings per share of $3.08, an increase of 11% over $2.78 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022; and • Cash returned to shareholders of $2.1 billion, including share purchases of $1.4 billion and dividends of $706 million.

Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, revenue growth in local currency was very strong across all geographic markets, industry groups and types of work. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 22 In our consulting business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Consulting revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets and Europe and strong growth in North America. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. In our managed services business, previously referred to as our outsourcing business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Managed services revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets, Europe and North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 9.5% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2023, we estimate that our full fiscal 2023 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 5% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. People Metrics Utilization Workforce Annualized Voluntary Attrition 91% 738,000 13% compared to 92% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to approximately 674,000 as of November 30, 2021 compared to 17% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 Utilization for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 91%, compared to 92% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 738,000 as of November 30, 2022, compared to approximately 674,000 as of November 30, 2021. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 13%, down from 17% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has been and continues to increase faster than in prior years. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we have improved pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, across our business. While we are increasing pricing, as well as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology, the impact of these actions may not fully offset the impact of compensation increases on our margin, potentially resulting in lower contract profitability in the future. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 23 Operating Expenses The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on managed services contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 32.9%, flat with the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was impacted by higher labor costs, including increased compensation costs, offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with 16.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, Sales and marketing costs increased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenues. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to the same period in fiscal 2022, General and administrative costs decreased 30 basis points due to lower non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 16.5%, compared with 16.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. New Bookings Three Months Ended Percent Increase (Decrease) U.S. Dollars Percent Increase (Decrease) Local Currency (in billions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 Consulting $ 8.1 $ 9.4 (14) % (5) % Managed Services (1) 8.1 7.4 10 20 Total New Bookings $ 16.2 $ 16.8 (3) % 6 % (1) Previously referred to as our outsourcing business. We provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large managed services contracts. The types of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. For example, managed services bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our remaining performance obligations disclosed in Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations.

Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 11% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Industrial and Health. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 17% in local currency, led by growth in Industrial, Banking & Capital Markets and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France. • Growth Markets revenues increased 19% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Public Service and Chemicals & Natural Resources. Revenue growth was led by Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $624 million, or 5%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 83.5% from 83.7% during this period. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 Operating expenses by category are as follows: Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Operating Expenses $ 13,155 83.5 % $ 12,531 83.7 % $ 624 Cost of services 10,562 67.1 10,048 67.1 513 Sales and marketing 1,550 9.8 1,454 9.7 96 General and administrative costs 1,043 6.6 1,028 6.9 15 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Cost of Services Cost of services for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $513 million, or 5%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 67.1% during this period. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 32.9% compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was impacted by higher labor costs, including increased compensation costs, offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $96 million, or 7%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 9.8% over 9.7% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $15 million, or 1%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.6% from 6.9% during this period. The decrease was due to lower non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2022. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased $159 million, or 7%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was 16.5%, compared with 16.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 1,310 17 % $ 1,244 18 % $ 65 Europe 690 14 745 15 (55) Growth Markets 593 19 445 15 148 Total $ 2,593 16.5 % $ 2,434 16.3 % $ 159 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates where significant, for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2022: • North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability, partially offset by higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income decreased as revenue growth in local currency was more than offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates which resulted in a decrease in U.S. dollar revenues . • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability and revenue growth in local currency, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates . Interest Income Interest income for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $45 million, an increase of $39 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher interest rates. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 26 Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 2022 were 23.3% and 24.4%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to lower tax expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2023 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.0% to 25.0%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $3.08 for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, compared with $2.78 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share Q1 FY22 As Reported $ 2.78 Higher revenue and operating results 0.19 Higher non-operating income 0.04 Lower effective tax rate 0.04 Lower share count 0.03 Q1 FY23 As Reported $ 3.08 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 27 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of November 30, 2022, Cash and cash equivalents was $5.9 billion, compared with $7.9 billion as of August 31, 2022. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2022 November 30, 2021 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 495 $ 531 $ (35) Investing activities (782) (1,913) 1,131 Financing activities (1,677) (1,069) (607) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (27) (80) 53 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,990) $ (2,531) $ 541 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $35 million decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income. Investing activities: The $1,131 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $607 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of November 30, 2022, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility $ 3,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,688 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 236 — Total $ 4,925 $ — Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $885 million of letters of credit outstanding as of November 30, 2022. We have a short-term commercial paper financing program backed by our $3 billion syndicated credit facility. As of November 30, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 28 Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the three months ended November 30, 2022 is as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Shares Amount Shares Amount Open-market share purchases (1) 4,513,266 $ 1,231 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 5,500 2 Other purchases (2) 696,498 187 — — Total 5,209,764 $ 1,417 5,500 $ 2 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the three months ended November 30, 2022, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2023. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 3.

(2) Since August 2001, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized and periodically confirmed a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we purchased 4,513,266 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of $1,231 million. The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date. (3) As of November 30, 2022, our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $4,897 million which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs. Since August 2001 and as of November 30, 2022, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $46.1 billion for share purchases and redemptions by Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. (4) During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Accenture purchased 696,498 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2021. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2022. Allowance for Credit Losses - Client Receivables and Contract Assets As of May 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 25,895 and $ 32,206 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: May 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 Equity method investments $ 172,512 $ 184,157 Investments without readily determinable fair values 158,991 145,369 Total non-current investments $ 331,503 $ 329,526 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net. Our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. As of May 31, 2022, the carrying amount of our investment was $ 148,140 , and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16 % ownership was $ 340,426 . We account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship.

See table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022, respectively.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2021-08 (""Topic 805"") On September 1, 2021, we early adopted FASB ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) rather than adjust them to fair value at the acquisition date. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 13 2. Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 24 billion and $ 23 billion as of May 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 40 % of our remaining performance obligations as of May 31, 2022 as revenue in fiscal 2022, an additional 36 % in fiscal 2023, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 733,982 and $ 700,080 as of May 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 826,042 and $ 731,445 as of May 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of May 31, 2022 As of August 31, 2021 Receivables $ 10,816,679 $ 8,796,992 Contract assets (current) 1,402,395 931,220 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 12,219,074 9,728,212 Contract assets (non-current) 35,714 38,334 Deferred revenues (current) 4,561,147 4,229,177 Deferred revenues (non-current) 733,982 700,080 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the nine months ended May 31, 2022 were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2022 and August 31, 2021 were $ 2.5 billion and $ 3.5 billion, respectively. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2021 and August 31, 2020 were $ 2.2 billion and $ 3.1 billion, respectively.

The income effect does not take into account “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - other,” since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.

Business Combinations and Dispositions Business Combinations During the nine months ended May 31, 2022, we completed individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of $ 2,181,316 , net of cash acquired. The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on our operations were not material. Dispositions During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we disposed of our business in Russia, which was part of our Europe segment. The transaction resulted in a non-operating loss of $ 96,294 , which was not deductible for tax purposes and did not have a material effect on our operations or financial results.

Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022 and 2021, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 31,285 and $ 67,812 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022, respectively, and net losses of $ 13,165 and net gains of $ 11,370 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: May 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 66,800 $ 109,416 Other non-current assets 41,290 70,250 Other Derivatives Other current assets 34,578 32,322 Total assets $ 142,668 $ 211,988 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 24,727 $ 5,867 Other non-current liabilities 27,774 8,585 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 35,556 3,614 Total liabilities $ 88,057 $ 18,066 Total fair value $ 54,611 $ 193,922 Total notional value $ 10,749,922 $ 10,045,903 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: May 31, 2022 August 31, 2021 Net derivative assets $ 83,716 $ 193,936 Net derivative liabilities 29,105 14 Total fair value $ 54,611 $ 193,922 Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 20 9. Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2022 and 2021 were 27.1 % and 25.0 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2022 included higher tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 and 2021 were 23.8 % and 22.1 %, respectively. Absent the $ 271,009 gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies and related $ 41,440 in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 would have been 22.4 %. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 included higher tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments.

Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of May 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 1,445,000 and $ 885,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 51,000 and $ 78,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. As of May 31, 2022 and August 31, 2021, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 1,108,966 and $ 928,918 , respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of May 31, 2022, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. On May 3, 2022, the court issued an order granting in part the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which we are appealing. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

There was no effect on total net assets or on any other items in Accenture’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The disclosure has been adjusted below and will be corrected in Accenture’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022.

Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 23 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2021, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2021. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2022” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2022. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not lim ited to those identified below. Business Risks • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions, including the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the related sanctions and other measures that have been and continue to be imposed in response to the conflict, as well as the current inflationary environment, and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to match people and skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business and operations, and the extent to which it will continue to do so and its impact on our future financial results are uncertain. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 Financial Risks • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. Operational Risks • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. Legal and Regulatory Risks • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2021. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 Overview Accenture plc is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in Strategy and Consulting, Technology, Operations and Accenture Song (formerly Accenture Interactive). We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We help our clients build their digital core, transform their operations, and accelerate revenue growth—creating tangible value across their enterprises at speed and scale. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions, levels of business confidence and the overall inflationary environment. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the sanctions and other measures that have been and continue to be imposed in response to this conflict have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we disposed of our business in Russia and recorded a non-operating loss of $96 million. We do not have a business in Ukraine or Belarus. While we have not experienced a material impact on our results of operations to date as a result of the conflict, a significant expansion of economic disruption or escalation of the conflict could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. Summary of Results We saw very strong demand across our business in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 as our clients continue their digital transformations. Key metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021 included: • Revenues of $16.2 billion, representing 22% growth in U.S. dollars and 27% growth in local currency; • New bookings of $17.0 billion, an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency; • Operating margin of 16.1%, a 10 basis point expansion; • Diluted earnings per share of $2.79, an increase of 16% over $2.40 for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, including a $0.15 per share or 6% negative impact from the disposition of our business in Russia; and • Cash returned to shareholders of $5.4 billion, including share purchases of $3.5 billion and dividends of $1.8 billion. Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 22% in U.S. dollars and 27% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 27% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2021. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, revenue growth in local currency was very strong across all geographic markets, industry groups and types of work. While the business environment remained competitive, pricing improved across our business. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Consulting revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 increased 29% in U.S. dollars and 32% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2021. Consulting revenue in local currency for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in Europe, Growth Markets and North America. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. In our outsourcing business, which we also refer to as our managed services business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 19% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Outsourcing revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 increased 20% in U.S. dollars and 22% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2021. Outsourcing revenue in local currency for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets, Europe and North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. While a significant portion of our revenues are in U.S. dollars, the majority of our revenues are denominated in other currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 26 U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 3% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2022, we estimate that our full fiscal 2022 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 4.5% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Utilization for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 91%, down from 93% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 710,000 as of May 31, 2022, compared to approximately 569,000 as of May 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 20%, compared to 17% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to match people and skills with client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation is increasing faster than in prior years. We are increasing our pricing, changing the mix of people and utilizing technology to reduce the impact of these compensation increases on our margin; however, the impact of these actions is lagging the impact of the compensation increases. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 32.9%, compared with 33.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 was 32.0% compared with 32.1% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. The decrease in gross margin for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2022 was due to higher labor costs, including increased compensation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and 16.6% for the nine months ended May 31, 2022, compared with 17.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and 16.8% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. For the third quarter compared to the same period in fiscal 2021, Sales and marketing costs decreased 30 basis points primarily due to a decrease in non-payroll costs, including lower advertising costs, partially offset by higher business development costs as a percentage of revenues. For the nine months ended May 31, 2022 compared to the same period in fiscal 2021, Sales and marketing costs decreased 40 basis points primarily due to lower selling and advertising costs as a percentage of revenues. For the third quarter, compared to the same period in fiscal 2021, General and administrative costs decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenues. For the nine months ended May 31, 2022, compared to the same period in fiscal 2021, General and administrative costs increased 20 basis points as a percentage of revenues. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 16.1%, compared with 16.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 was 15.4%, compared with 15.3% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. During the nine months ended May 31, 2021, we recorded gains of $271 million and related tax expense of $41 million related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The effective tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 27.1% and 25.0%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 was 23.8%, compared with 22.1% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 would have been 22.4%. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 27 Diluted earnings per share were $2.79 for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with $2.40 for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per share were $8.11 for the nine months ended May 31, 2022, compared with $6.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. The $230 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.36 during the nine months ended May 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.60 for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2021, excluding the impact of the investment gains, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period. New Bookings New bookings for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were $17.0 billion, with consulting bookings of $9.1 billion and outsourcing bookings of $7.8 billion. New bookings for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 were $53.3 billion, with consulting bookings of $29.4 billion and outsourcing bookings of $23.9 billion. New bookings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 were $15.4 billion, with consulting bookings of $8.0 billion and outsourcing bookings of $7.4 billion. New bookings for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 were $44.3 billion, with consulting bookings of $22.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $21.6 billion.

Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 decreased to 32.9% from 33.2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin was due to higher labor costs, including increased compensation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $254 million, or 18%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 10.3% from 10.6% during this period primarily due to a decrease in non-payroll costs, including lower advertising costs, partially offset by higher business development costs. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $172 million, or 20%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.5% from 6.6% during this period.

Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended May 31, 2022 May 31, 2021 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 1,380 18 % $ 1,128 18 % $ 251 Europe 694 13 608 14 86 Growth Markets 530 17 382 15 147 Total $ 2,603 16.1 % $ 2,119 16.0 % $ 484 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2021: • North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue gro wth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability. Loss on Disposition of Russia Business We recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 27.1% and 25.0%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings.

Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2021: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 25% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Software & Platforms and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 30% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Industrial and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. • Growth Markets revenues increased 30% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Japan, Australia and Brazil. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 increased $7,620 million, or 24%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.6% from 84.7% during this period. Operating expenses by category are as follows: Nine Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) May 31, 2022 May 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Operating Expenses $ 39,072 84.6 % $ 31,451 84.7 % $ 7,620 Cost of services 31,415 68.0 25,216 67.9 6,199 Sales and marketing 4,530 9.8 3,773 10.2 757 General and administrative costs 3,126 6.8 2,462 6.6 665 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 32 Cost of Services Cost of services for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 increased $6,199 million, or 25%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 68.0% over 67.9% during this period. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 decreased to 32.0% from 32.1% during the nine months ended May 31, 2021. The decrease in gross margin was due to higher labor costs, including increased compensation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 increased $757 million, or 20%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.8% from 10.2% during this period. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling and advertising costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 increased $665 million, or 27%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.8% over 6.6% during this period. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 increased $1,436 million, or 25%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2021. Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 was 15.4%, compared with 15.3% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Nine Months Ended May 31, 2022 May 31, 2021 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 3,715 17 % $ 2,789 16 % $ 926 Europe 1,970 13 1,740 14 230 Growth Markets 1,414 16 1,133 15 281 TOTAL $ 7,099 15.4 % $ 5,663 15.3 % $ 1,436 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the nine months ended May 31, 2022 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2021. • North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the nine months ended May 31, 2022, other income (expense), net decreased $242 million from the nine months ended May 31, 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Loss on Disposition of Russia Business We recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during the nine months ended May 31, 2022. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 33 Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 was 23.8%, compared with 22.1% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. Absent the $271 million investment gains and related $41 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 would have been 22.4%. The higher effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2022 was primarily due to tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2022 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $8.11 for the nine months ended May 31, 2022, compared with $6.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. The $230 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.36 during the nine months ended May 31, 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.60 for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share FY21 As Reported $ 6.96 Higher revenue and operating results 1.73 Lower non-operating expense (excluding loss on disposition of Russia business) 0.05 Lower share count 0.03 Higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.03) Higher effective tax rate (excluding loss on disposition of Russia business) (0.12) Loss on disposition of Russia business (0.15) Lower gains on an investment, net of tax (0.36) FY22 As Reported $ 8.11 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 34 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, 2022, Cash and cash equivalents was $6.7 billion, compared with $8.2 billion as of August 31, 2021. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Nine Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) May 31, 2022 May 31, 2021 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 5,751 $ 6,539 $ (788) Investing activities (2,852) (1,458) (1,394) Financing activities (4,210) (3,559) (651) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (154) 72 (226) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,465) $ 1,594 $ (3,059) Operating activities: The $788 million decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, including receivables from clients and contract assets, partially offset by higher net income. Investing activities: The $1,394 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions, lower proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments, and higher spending on purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Dispositions) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $651 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of May 31, 2022, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility $ 3,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,546 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 238 — Total $ 4,784 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $885 million of letters of credit outstanding as of May 31, 2022. We have a short-term commercial paper financing program backed by our $3 billion syndicated credit facility. As of May 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 35 Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the nine months ended May 31, 2022 is as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.

These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the nine months ended May 31, 2022, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2022. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 3.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 11 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2021. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2022. Allowance for Credit Losses - Client Receivables and Contract Assets As of February 28, 2022 and August 31, 2021, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 27,854 and $ 32,206 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: February 28, 2022 August 31, 2021 Equity method investments $ 180,624 $ 184,157 Investments without readily determinable fair values 156,252 145,369 Total non-current investments $ 336,876 $ 329,526 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net. Our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. As of February 28, 2022, the carrying amount of our investment was $ 153,687 , and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16 % ownership was $ 430,436 . We account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2021-08 (""Topic 805"") On September 1, 2021, we early adopted FASB ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) rather than adjust them to fair value at the acquisition date. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 25 billion and $ 23 billion as of February 28, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 56 % of our remaining performance obligations as of February 28, 2022 as revenue in fiscal 2022, an additional 24 % in fiscal 2023, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 746,596 and $ 700,080 as of February 28, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 793,800 and $ 731,445 as of February 28, 2022 and August 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of February 28, 2022 As of August 31, 2021 Receivables $ 10,342,236 $ 8,796,992 Contract assets (current) 1,248,640 931,220 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 11,590,876 9,728,212 Contract assets (non-current) 39,442 38,334 Deferred revenues (current) 4,663,024 4,229,177 Deferred revenues (non-current) 746,596 700,080 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the six months ended February 28, 2022, were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2021 and August 31, 2021 were $ 2.3 billion and $ 3.2 billion, respectively. Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2021 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2020 and August 31, 2020 were $ 2.0 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 18 8. Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 13,048 and $ 36,527 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2022, respectively, and net losses $ 3,789 and net gains $ 24,535 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2021, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: February 28, 2022 August 31, 2021 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 79,049 $ 109,416 Other non-current assets 61,017 70,250 Other Derivatives Other current assets 32,932 32,322 Total assets $ 172,998 $ 211,988 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 10,964 $ 5,867 Other non-current liabilities 8,736 8,585 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 20,425 3,614 Total liabilities $ 40,125 $ 18,066 Total fair value $ 132,873 $ 193,922 Total notional value $ 10,163,212 $ 10,045,903 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: February 28, 2022 August 31, 2021 Net derivative assets $ 138,426 $ 193,936 Net derivative liabilities 5,553 14 Total fair value $ 132,873 $ 193,922 Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 19 9. Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021 were 19.2 % and 17.1 %, respectively. Absent the $ 151,309 gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies and related $ 18,534 in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2021 would have been 17.5 %. The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2022 included higher tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by lower adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, and higher tax benefits from share-based payments. Our effective tax rates for the six months ended February 28, 2022 and 2021 were 22.0 % and 20.4 %, respectively. Absent the $ 271,009 gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies and related $ 41,440 in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2021 would have been 20.8 %.The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2022 included higher tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments.

Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of February 28, 2022 and August 31, 2021, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 1,407,000 and $ 885,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 53,000 and $ 78,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. As of February 28, 2022 and August 31, 2021, we have issued or provided guarantees in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds of $ 1,000,408 and $ 928,918 , respectively, the majority of which support certain contracts that require us to provide them as a guarantee of our performance. These guarantees are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations are satisfied. In general, we would only be liable for these guarantees in the event we defaulted in performing our obligations under each contract, the probability of which we believe is remote. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations, indemnification provisions, letters of credit and surety bonds, and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of February 28, 2022, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Accenture's revenues in Russia for the three and six m onths ended February 28, 2022 were $ 43,958 and $ 83,759 , respectively, and revenues for fiscal 2021 were $ 118,576 . Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 22 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2021, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2021. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2022” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2022. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections.

Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not limited to those identified below. Many of the following risks, uncertainties and other factors identified below may be amplified by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the sanctions (including their duration), and other measures being imposed in response to this conflict, as well as any escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict’s current scope. Business Risks • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to match people and skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business and operations, and the extent to which it will continue to do so and its impact on our future financial results are uncertain. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 23 Financial Risks • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. Operational Risks • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. Legal and Regulatory Risks • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland.

Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 Overview Accenture plc is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We help our clients build their digital core, transform their operations, and accelerate revenue growth—creating tangible value across their enterprises at speed and scale. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to this conflict have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty. As we announced on March 3, 2022, we are discontinuing our business in Russia. We do not have a business in Ukraine. While Russia does not constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For additional information, see Note 12 (Subsequent Event) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. Summary of Results We saw very strong demand across our business in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 as our clients continue their digital transformations. Key metrics for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 included: • Revenues of $15.0 billion, representing 24% growth in U.S. dollars and 28% growth in local currency; • New bookings of $19.6 billion, an increase of 22% in U.S. dollars and 26% in local currency; • Operating margin of 13.7%, flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021; • Diluted earnings per share of $2.54, an increase of 14% from $2.23 for the second quarter last year, which included $0.21 in gains on an investment; excluding these gains, diluted earnings per share were up 25% from adjusted earnings per share of $2.03 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021; and • Cash returned to shareholders of $3.8 billion, including share purchases of $2.5 billion and dividends of $1.2 billion. Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 28% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2022 increased 26% in U.S. dollars and 28% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2021. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, revenue growth in local currency was very strong across all geographic markets, industry groups and types of work. While the business environment remained competitive, pricing improved across our business. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 29% in U.S. dollars and 34% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Consulting revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2022 increased 31% in U.S. dollars and 33% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2021. Consulting revenue in local currency for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in Europe, North America and Growth Markets. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. In our outsourcing business, which we also refer to as our managed services business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 19% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Outsourcing revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2022 increased 20% in U.S. dollars and 22% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2021. Outsourcing revenue in local currency for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets, Europe and North America. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2021, resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% and 2% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2022, we estimate that our full fiscal 2022 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Utilization for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 92%, down from 94% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 699,000 as of February 28, 2022, compared to approximately 537,000 as of February 28, 2021. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 18%, compared to 12% in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as a means to match people and skills with client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of people to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. During fiscal 2021, we adjusted compensation in line with the increasing market relevant pay around the world. In addition, due to strong demand for our services in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we are hiring significantly more people at a time when compensation is increasing, as compared to prior years. We are increasing our pricing and changing the mix of people to reduce the impact of these compensation increases on our margin; however, the impact of the pricing improvements is lagging the impact of these compensation increases. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 30.1%, compared with 29.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2022 was 31.5% compared with 31.4% for the six months ended February 28, 2021. The increase in gross margin for the second quarter and six months ended February 28, 2022 was due to lower non-payroll costs partially offset by higher labor costs compared to the same periods in fiscal 2021. The higher labor costs resulted from increased compensation and subcontractor costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of a one-time bonus equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 16.5% for the six months ended February 28, 2022, compared with 16.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and 16.6% for the six months ended February 28, 2021. During the second quarter compared to the same period in fiscal 2021, Sales and marketing costs remained flat as a percentage of revenue. For the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared to the same period in fiscal 2021, Sales and marketing costs decreased 30 basis points primarily due to lower selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues. For the second quarter and six months ended February 28, 2022, compared to the same period in fiscal 2021, General and administrative costs increased 40 and 30 basis points, respectively. The increase in General and administrative costs for the second quarter and six months ended February 28, 2022 was due to higher non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 13.7%, compared with 13.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2022 was 15.0%, compared with 14.9% for the six months ended February 28, 2021. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we recorded gains of $151 million and related tax expense of $19 million related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. During the six months ended February 28, 2021, we recorded gains of $271 million and related tax expense of $41 million related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 19.2% and 17.1%, respectively. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 would have been 17.5%. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2022 was 22.0%, compared with 20.4% for the six months ended Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 26 February 28, 2021. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2021 would have been 20.8%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.54 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with $2.23 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The $133 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $2.03 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per share were $5.32 for the six months ended February 28, 2022, compared with $4.55 for the six months ended February 28, 2021. The $230 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.35 during the six months ended February 28, 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.20 for the six months ended February 28, 2021. We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021, excluding the impact of the investment gains, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period. New Bookings New bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 were $19.6 billion, with consulting bookings of $10.9 billion and outsourcing bookings of $8.7 billion. New bookings for the six months ended February 28, 2022 were $36.4 billion, with consulting bookings of $20.3 billion and outsourcing bookings of $16.1 billion. New bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 were $16.0 billion, with consulting bookings of $8.0 billion and outsourcing bookings of $8.0 billion. New bookings for the six months ended February 28, 2021 were $28.9 billion, with consulting bookings of $14.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $14.3 billion.

Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 31% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Industrial and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy. • Growth Markets revenues increased 30% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Japan, Australia and Brazil. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $2,551 million, or 24%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 86.3% during this period.

Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 28 Cost of Services Cost of services for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $2,030 million, or 24%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.9% from 70.3% during this period. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased to 30.1% over 29.7% during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in gross margin was due to lower non-payroll costs partially offset by higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. The higher labor costs resulted from increased compensation and subcontractor costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of a one-time bonus equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $275 million, or 24%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 9.4% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $245 million, or 31%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 7.0% over 6.6% during this period. The increase was due to higher non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $408 million, or 25%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating margin for both the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was 13.7%. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended February 28, 2022 February 28, 2021 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 1,091 15 % $ 772 14 % $ 319 Europe 532 11 503 12 29 Growth Markets 439 15 378 16 61 Total $ 2,062 13.7 % $ 1,654 13.7 % $ 408 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2021: • North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue gro wth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, other income (expense), net decreased $117 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments, partially offset by foreign exchange gains. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 19.2% and 17.1%, respectively. Absent the $151 million investment gains and related $19 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 would have been 17.5%. The higher effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by lower adjustments to prior year tax liabilities and higher tax benefits from share-based payments. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 29 Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.54 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with $2.23 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The $133 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share Q2 FY21 As Reported $ 2.23 Higher revenue and operating results 0.52 Lower non-operating expense 0.04 Higher effective tax rate (0.05) Lower gains on an investment, net of tax (0.21) Q2 FY22 As Reported $ 2.54 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.

The increase in gross margin was due to lower non-payroll costs partially offset by higher labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. The higher labor costs resulted from increased compensation and subcontractor costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of a one-time bonus equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the six months ended February 28, 2022 increased $503 million, or 21%, over the six months ended February 28, 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.6% from 9.9% during this period. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling and other business development costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the six months ended February 28, 2022 increased $493 million, or 31%, over the six months ended February 28, 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.9% over 6.6% during this period. The increase was due to higher non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the six months ended February 28, 2022 increased $952 million, or 27%, over the six months ended February 28, 2021. Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2022 was 15.0%, compared with 14.9% for the six months ended February 28, 2021. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Six Months Ended February 28, 2022 February 28, 2021 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 2,335 17 % $ 1,661 15 % $ 674 Europe 1,276 13 1,132 14 144 Growth Markets 884 15 751 16 133 TOTAL $ 4,496 15.0 % $ 3,544 14.9 % $ 952 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the six months ended February 28, 2022 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the six months ended February 28, 2022 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2021. • North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the six months ended February 28, 2022, other income (expense), net decreased $234 million from the six months ended February 28, 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments, partially offset by foreign exchange gains. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2022 was 22.0%, compared with 20.4% for the six months ended February 28, 2021. Absent the $271 million investment gains and related $41 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2021 would have been 20.8%.The higher effective tax rate for the six months ended February Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 32 28, 2022 was primarily due to tax expense from changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2022 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.0% to 25.0%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $5.32 for the six months ended February 28, 2022, compared with $4.55 for the six months ended February 28, 2021. The $230 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.35 during the six months ended February 28, 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.20 for the six months ended February 28, 2021. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share FY21 As Reported $ 4.55 Higher revenue and operating results 1.16 Lower non-operating expense 0.03 Lower share count 0.02 Higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.01) Higher effective tax rate (0.08) Lower gains on an investment, net of tax (0.35) FY22 As Reported $ 5.32 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 33 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of February 28, 2022, Cash and cash equivalents was $5.5 billion, compared with $8.2 billion as of August 31, 2021. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Six Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) February 28, 2022 February 28, 2021 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,686 $ 4,138 $ (1,451) Investing activities (2,185) (886) (1,299) Financing activities (3,106) (2,546) (560) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (97) 46 (143) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (2,702) $ 751 $ (3,453) Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $1,451 million decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to increases in receivables from clients and contract assets, as well as higher spending on certain compensation payments, partially offset by higher net income. Investing activities: The $1,299 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions, lower proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments, and higher spending on purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $560 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of February 28, 2022, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility $ 3,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,355 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 247 — Total $ 4,602 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $771 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 28, 2022. We have a short-term commercial paper financing program backed by our $3 billion syndicated credit facility. As of February 28, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 34 Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the six months ended February 28, 2022 is as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Shares Amount Shares Amount Open-market share purchases (1) 4,793,863 $ 1,674 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 11,318 4 Other purchases (2) 2,223,426 860 — — Total 7,017,289 $ 2,534 11,318 $ 4 (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the six months ended February 28, 2022, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2022. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 3.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we purchased 2,859,569 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of $1,005 million.

(3) As of February 28, 2022, our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $4,608 million which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs.

(4) During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, Accenture purchased 1,722,817 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 9 1. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2021. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2022. Allowance for Credit Losses - Client Receivables and Contract Assets As of November 30, 2021 and August 31, 2021, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 32,521 and $ 32,206 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: November 30, 2021 August 31, 2021 Equity method investments $ 177,119 $ 184,157 Investments without readily determinable fair values 148,595 145,369 Total non-current investments $ 325,714 $ 329,526 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of Other income (expense), net. Our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. As of November 30, 2021, the carrying amount of our investment was $ 156,574 , and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16 % ownership was $ 524,113 . We account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship.

See table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for the three months ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Three Months Ended November 30, 2021 November 30, 2020 (1) Depreciation $ 138,793 $ 133,918 Amortization - Deferred transition 67,206 81,356 Amortization - Intangible assets 102,542 67,207 Operating lease cost 190,242 184,372 Other 2,082 1,347 Total depreciation, amortization and other $ 500,865 $ 468,200 (1) Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2021-08 (""Topic 805"") On September 1, 2021, we early adopted FASB ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) rather than adjust them to fair value at the acquisition date. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 23 billion as of November 30, 2021 and August 31, 2021. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 65 % of our remaining performance obligations as of November 30, 2021 as revenue in fiscal 2022, an additional 19 % in fiscal 2023, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 701,629 and $ 700,080 as of November 30, 2021 and August 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 751,939 and $ 731,445 as of November 30, 2021 and August 31, 2021, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of November 30, 2021 As of August 31, 2021 Receivables $ 10,032,721 $ 8,796,992 Contract assets (current) 1,087,680 931,220 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 11,120,401 9,728,212 Contract assets (non-current) 41,612 38,334 Deferred revenues (current) 4,006,078 4,229,177 Deferred revenues (non-current) 701,629 700,080 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the three months ended November 30, 2021, were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2021 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2021 were $ 2.5 billion. Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2020 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2020 were $ 2.0 billion.

The income effect does not take into account “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests - other,” since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.

Business Combinations During the three months ended November 30, 2021, we completed individually immaterial acquisitions for total consideration of $ 1,751,636 , net of cash acquired.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 16 8. Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 23,479 and net gains of $ 28,324 for the three months ended November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: November 30, 2021 August 31, 2021 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 76,213 $ 109,416 Other non-current assets 44,558 70,250 Other Derivatives Other current assets 20,587 32,322 Total assets $ 141,358 $ 211,988 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 7,471 $ 5,867 Other non-current liabilities 10,160 8,585 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 18,763 3,614 Total liabilities $ 36,394 $ 18,066 Total fair value $ 104,964 $ 193,922 Total notional value $ 9,618,821 $ 10,045,903 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: November 30, 2021 August 31, 2021 Net derivative assets $ 109,900 $ 193,936 Net derivative liabilities 4,936 14 Total fair value $ 104,964 $ 193,922 Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 17 9. Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2021 and 2020 were 24.4 % and 23.4 %, respectively. Absent the $ 119,700 gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies and related $ 22,906 in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2020 would have been 23.7 %. The effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2021 was higher primarily due to tax expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and higher tax benefits from share-based payments. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of November 30, 2021 and August 31, 2021, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 867,000 and $ 885,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 76,000 and $ 78,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of November 30, 2021, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 19 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2021, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2021. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2022” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2022. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not limited to: Business Risks • The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business and operations, and the extent to which it will continue to do so and its impact on our future financial results are uncertain. • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to match people and skills with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We face legal, reputational and financial risks from any failure to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 20 Financial Risks • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. Operational Risks • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. Legal and Regulatory Risks • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2021. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 21 Overview Accenture plc is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). We help our clients build their digital core, transform their operations, and accelerate revenue growth—creating tangible value across their enterprises at speed and scale. We saw very strong demand across our business in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 as our clients continue their digital transformations. Highlights from the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021 included: • Revenues of $15.0 billion, representing 27% growth in both U.S. dollars and local currency; • New bookings of $16.8 billion, an increase of 30% in both U.S. dollars and local currency; • Operating margin of 16.3%, a 20 basis point expansion; and • Cash returned to shareholders of $1.5 billion, including share purchases of $845 million and dividends of $613 million. Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 27% in both U.S. dollars and local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, revenue growth in local currency was very strong across all geographic markets, industry groups and types of work. The business environment remained competitive. In many areas, our pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, improved. In our consulting business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 33% in U.S. dollars and 32% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Consulting revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in Growth Markets, Europe and North America. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. In our outsourcing business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 21% in both U.S. dollars and local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Outsourcing revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was driven by very strong growth in North America, Growth Markets and Europe. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could in the future have a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, resulting in minimal currency translation impact. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2022, we estimate that our full fiscal 2022 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 92%, down from 93% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 674,000 as of November 30, 2021, compared to approximately 514,000 as of November 30, 2020. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions. Annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 17%, compared to 9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 22 terminations as a means to match people and skills with client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of people to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. During fiscal 2021, we adjusted compensation in line with the increasing market relevant pay around the world. In addition, due to strong demand for our services in the first quarter, we are hiring significantly more people at a time when compensation is increasing, as compared to prior years. We are increasing our pricing and changing the mix of people to reduce the impact of these compensation increases on our margin; however, the impact of the pricing improvements is lagging the impact of these compensation increases. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 32.9%, compared with 33.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was due to higher labor, including increased usage of subcontractors, and higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues was 16.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with 17.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to the same period in fiscal 2021, Sales and marketing costs decreased 70 basis points due to lower business development costs as a percentage of revenues and General and administrative costs increased 30 basis points due to higher non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 16.3%, compared with 16.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we recorded gains of $120 million and tax expense of $23 million related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 24.4% and 23.4%, respectively. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 would have been 23.7%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.78 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with $2.32 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The $97 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.15 during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $2.17 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, excluding the impact of the investment gains, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period. New Bookings New bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 were $16.8 billion, with consulting bookings of $9.4 billion and outsourcing bookings of $7.4 billion. New bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $12.9 billion, with consulting bookings of $6.6 billion and outsourcing bookings of $6.3 billion. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2.

Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 26% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 28% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Industrial and Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. • Growth Markets revenues increased 30% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Japan and Australia. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $2,659 million, or 27%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 83.7% from 83.9% during this period. Operating expenses by category are as follows: Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2021 November 30, 2020 Increase (Decrease) Operating Expenses $ 12,531 83.7 % $ 9,872 83.9 % $ 2,659 Cost of services 10,048 67.1 7,864 66.9 2,184 Sales and marketing 1,454 9.7 1,227 10.4 227 General and administrative costs 1,028 6.9 780 6.6 248 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 Cost of Services Cost of services for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $2,184 million, or 28%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 67.1% from 66.9% during this period. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 decreased to 32.9% from 33.1% during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin was due to higher labor, including increased usage of subcontractors, and higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $227 million, or 19%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.7% from 10.4% during this period. The decrease was primarily due to lower business development costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $248 million, or 32%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.9% from 6.6% during this period. The increase was primarily due to higher non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2021. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $544 million, or 29%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 16.3%, compared with 16.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended November 30, 2021 November 30, 2020 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 1,244 18 % $ 889 16 % $ 356 Europe 745 15 629 16 115 Growth Markets 445 15 372 16 73 Total $ 2,434 16.3 % $ 1,891 16.1 % $ 544 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2021: • North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs . • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue gro wth, partially offset by lower contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, other income (expense), net decreased $117 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 2021 were 24.4% and 23.4%, respectively. Absent the $120 million investment gains and related $23 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 would have been 23.7%. The higher effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to tax expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and higher tax benefits from share-based payments. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2022 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.0% to 25.0%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.78 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, compared with $2.32 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The $97 million investment gains, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.15 in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $2.17 for first quarter of fiscal 2021. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share Q1 FY21 As Reported $ 2.32 Higher revenue and operating results 0.64 Lower share count 0.01 Net Income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.01) Higher effective tax rate (0.03) Lower gains on an investment, net of tax (0.15) Q1 FY22 As Reported $ 2.78 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of November 30, 2021, Cash and cash equivalents was $5.6 billion, compared with $8.2 billion as of August 31, 2021. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2021 November 30, 2020 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 531 $ 1,603 $ (1,072) Investing activities (1,913) (446) (1,466) Financing activities (1,069) (999) (70) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (80) 22 (102) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (2,531) $ 179 $ (2,710) Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $1,072 million decrease in operating cash flows was due to a larger increase in receivables from clients and contract assets as well as higher spending on certain compensation payments, partially offset by higher net income. Investing activities: The $1,466 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions, lower proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments, and higher spending on purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $70 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of November 30, 2021, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility $ 3,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,276 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 252 — Total $ 4,527 $ — Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $718 million of letters of credit outstanding as of November 30, 2021. We have a short-term commercial paper financing program backed by our $3 billion syndicated credit facility. As of November 30, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding.

Exchangeable Shares (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Shares Amount Shares Amount Open-market share purchases (1) 1,934,294 $ 669 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 7,000 3 Other purchases (2) 500,609 174 — — Total 2,434,903 $ 843 7,000 $ 3 (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the three months ended November 30, 2021, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2022. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 3.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 11 1. Basis Of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 22, 2020. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2021. Allowance for Credit Losses - Client Receivables and Contract Assets We record client receivables and contract assets at their face amounts less an allowance for credit losses. The allowance represents our estimate of expected credit losses based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information. As of May 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 36,031 and $ 40,277 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Concentrations of Credit Risk Our financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments and client receivables, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: May 31, 2021 August 31, 2020 Equity method investments $ 186,710 $ 240,446 Investments without readily determinable fair values 140,787 84,068 Total non-current investments $ 327,497 $ 324,514 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of other income (expense), net. Our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. As of May 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our investment was $ 167,538 and $ 230,219 , and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16 % and 22 % ownership was $ 704,066 and $ 956,308 , respectively. We account for Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 12 the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship. Depreciation and Amortization As of May 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,552,204 and $ 2,313,731 , respectively. See table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, respectively. Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended May 31, 2021 May 31, 2020 May 31, 2021 May 31, 2020 Depreciation $ 124,502 $ 119,148 $ 377,910 $ 338,830 Amortization - Deferred transition 65,417 71,278 228,390 217,946 Amortization - Intangible assets 93,980 62,883 234,933 172,054 Other - Operating lease cost 195,087 191,351 563,728 557,404 Total depreciation, amortization and other $ 478,986 $ 444,660 $ 1,404,961 $ 1,286,234 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13 (“Topic 326”) On September 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which amends guidance on recognition and measurement of credit losses and related disclosures. The amendments replace the existing incurred loss impairment model with a methodology to measure and recognize lifetime expected credit losses for all in-scope financial assets, including accounts receivable and contract assets. The adoption did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 22 billion and $ 20 billion as of May 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 39 % of our remaining performance obligations as of May 31, 2021 as revenue in fiscal 2021, an additional 37 % in fiscal 2022, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 698,740 and $ 690,931 as of May 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 730,919 and $ 723,168 as of May 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of May 31, 2021 As of August 31, 2020 Receivables $ 8,637,841 $ 7,192,110 Contract assets (current) 835,600 654,782 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 9,473,441 7,846,892 Contract assets (non-current) 40,455 43,257 Deferred revenues (current) 4,230,907 3,636,741 Deferred revenues (non-current) 698,740 690,931 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the nine months ended May 31, 2021, were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2021 and August 31, 2020 were $ 2.2 billion and $ 3.1 billion, respectively. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2020 and August 31, 2019 were $ 1.9 billion and $ 2.6 billion, respectively.

The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units.

Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 13,165 and net gains $ 11,370 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021, respectively, and net gains of $ 17,132 and net losses of $ 38,026 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: May 31, 2021 August 31, 2020 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 111,655 $ 75,871 Other non-current assets 53,723 50,914 Other Derivatives Other current assets 9,899 27,964 Total assets $ 175,277 $ 154,749 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 12,078 $ 13,614 Other non-current liabilities 13,124 13,576 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 12,602 11,828 Total liabilities $ 37,804 $ 39,018 Total fair value $ 137,473 $ 115,731 Total notional value $ 9,257,149 $ 9,600,691 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: May 31, 2021 August 31, 2020 Net derivative assets $ 157,701 $ 129,520 Net derivative liabilities 20,228 13,789 Total fair value $ 137,473 $ 115,731 Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 19 9. Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020 were 25.0 % and 25.5 %, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2021 was primarily due to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by lower benefits from tax law changes. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020 were 22.1 % and 22.3 %, respectively. Absent the $ 271,009 and $ 113,192 gains on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies and related $ 41,440 and $ 18,732 in tax expense, our effective tax rates for both the nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020 would have been 22.4 %. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of May 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 983,000 and $ 832,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 80,000 and $ 87,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of May 31, 2021, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 21 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2021” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2021. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not limited to those identified below. For a discussion of risks and actions taken in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, see the “Overview” below and “ Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. ” under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. Many of the following risks, uncertainties and other factors identified below are, and will be, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. • Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 22 • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 23 Overview The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the health and well-being of people, disrupted businesses and restricted travel worldwide, causing significant economic disruption and uncertainty. While the rate and pace of recovery has differed by geography and industry, during the third quarter of 2021 we saw strong momentum across all dimensions of our business, including the industries most affected by the pandemic. This momentum is driven by growing demand for digital transformation and is increasing the need for people to serve our clients. We are gradually returning to our and our clients’ offices where permissible and traveling as needed, while prioritizing the well-being of our people. During the quarter, there was a considerable increase in new COVID-19 cases in India. Our ability to deliver services to our clients was not materially impacted as we initiated business continuity procedures and took actions to support our people and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business and financial operating results, and there is uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. For a discussion of risks related to the pandemic, see “Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.” under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. Summary of Results Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 21% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2020. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs during the first half of fiscal 2021, which reduced revenues approximately 1% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, revenue growth in local currency was very strong in North America, Growth Markets and Europe. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service, Communications, Media & Technology, Products and Financial Services and modest in Resources. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and consulting during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The business environment remained competitive. In many areas, our pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, was lower. In our consulting business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 21% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Consulting revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 increased 8% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2020. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs during the first half of fiscal 2021, which reduced consulting revenues approximately 2% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. Consulting revenue in local currency for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was driven by very strong growth in Europe, North America and Growth Markets. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. In our outsourcing business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 20% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Outsourcing revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2020. Outsourcing revenue in local currency for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was driven by very strong growth in North America, Growth Markets and Europe. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2021 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 3% higher respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2021, we estimate that our full fiscal 2021 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3.5% higher than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was 93%, up from 88% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, increased to approximately 569,000 as of May 31, 2021, compared to approximately 513,000 as of May 31, 2020. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was 17%, up from 11% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of people to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was 33.2%, compared with 32.1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 was 32.1% compared with 31.5% for the nine months ended May 31, 2020. The increase in gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2021, compared to the same period in fiscal 2020 was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs, including a one-time bonus for all employees below the managing director level in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 17.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and 16.8% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021, compared with 16.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and 16.6% for the nine months ended May 31, 2020. For the third quarter compared to the same period in fiscal 2020, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher non-payroll costs, including higher advertising costs. For the nine months ended May 31, 2021 compared to the same period in fiscal 2020, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points. For both the third quarter and nine months ended May 31, 2021, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2020, General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 30 basis points, primarily due to higher non-payroll costs. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was 16.0%, compared with 15.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 was 15.3%, compared with 14.8% for the nine months ended May 31, 2020. During the first half of fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $271 million and $113 million and related tax expense of $41 million and $19 million, respectively, related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The effective tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 25.0% and 25.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 was 22.1%, compared with 22.3% for the nine months ended May 31, 2020. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rates for both the nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020 would have been 22.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.40 for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with $1.90 for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per share were $6.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2021, compared with $5.90 for the nine months ended May 31, 2020. The $230 million and $94 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.36 and $0.15 during the nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, respectively. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.60 and $5.75 for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, respectively. We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, excluding the impact of gains related to an investment, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance when comparing these periods.

Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 18% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 14% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, followed by Banking & Capital Markets and Industrial. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom, followed by Italy and Germany. • Growth Markets revenues increased 15% in local currency, led by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Banking & Capital Markets and Public Service. Revenue growth was led by Japan, followed by Brazil. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $1,867 million, or 20%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.0% from 84.4% during this period.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 27 Cost of Services Cost of services for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $1,397 million, or 19%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 66.8% from 67.9% during this period. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased to 33.2% from 32.1% during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin was due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $288 million, or 26%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.6% from 10.2% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher non-payroll costs, including advertising costs, compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $181 million, or 26%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.6% from 6.3% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $406 million, or 24%, over the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended May 31, 2021 May 31, 2020 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 1,128 18 % $ 721 14 % $ 407 Europe 608 14 535 15 72 Growth Markets 382 15 456 21 (74) Total $ 2,119 16.0 % $ 1,713 15.6 % $ 406 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2020: • North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, higher contract profitability and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth. • Growth Markets operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs, lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 25.0% and 25.5%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2021 was primarily due to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by lower benefits from tax law changes.

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Revenues Revenues were impacted by a decline in reimbursable travel costs during the first half of fiscal 2021, which reduced revenue growth by approximately 1% for the nine months ended May 31, 2021. The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2020: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service and Software & Platforms. The increases were partially offset by declines in Energy and Chemicals & Natural Resources. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Software & Platforms and Life Sciences. The increases were partially offset by declines in High Tech and Chemicals & Natural Resources. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom, Italy and Switzerland. • Growth Markets revenues increased 8% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Public Service and High Tech. Revenue growth was driven by Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 increased $2,928 million, or 10%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.7% from 85.2% during this period.

Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 increased to 32.1% from 31.5% during the nine months ended May 31, 2020. The increase in gross margin was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs, including a one-time bonus for all employees below the managing director level in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 increased $301 million, or 9%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 10.2% from 10.4% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 increased $367 million, or 18%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2020, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.6% from 6.3% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 increased $694 million, or 14%, over the nine months ended May 31, 2020.

We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the nine months ended May 31, 2021 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The reduction in travel costs during the first half of fiscal 2021 had a favorable impact on operating income during the nine months ended May 31, 2021. In addition, during the nine months ended May 31, 2021 each geographic market’s operating income was unfavorably impacted by higher labor costs, including a one-time bonus in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2020: • North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, higher consulting contract profitability and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. • Growth Markets operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs and lower consulting contract profitability. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 31 Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the nine months ended May 31, 2021, other income (expense), net increased $224 million over the nine months ended May 31, 2020, primarily due to higher gains on investments. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 was 22.1%, compared with 22.3% for the nine months ended May 31, 2020. Absent the $271 million and $113 million gains on an investment and related $41 million and $19 million in tax expense, our effective tax rates for both the nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020 would have been 22.4%. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2021 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.0% to 24.0%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $6.96 for the nine months ended May 31, 2021, compared with $5.90 for the nine months ended May 31, 2020. The $230 million and $94 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.36 and $0.15 during the nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, respectively. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $6.60 and $5.75 for the nine months ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, respectively. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share FY20 As Reported $ 5.90 Higher revenue and operating results 0.83 Higher gains on an investment, net of tax 0.21 Lower share count 0.02 FY21 As Reported $ 6.96 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, 2021, Cash and cash equivalents was $10.0 billion, compared with $8.4 billion as of August 31, 2020. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Nine Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) May 31, 2021 May 31, 2020 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 6,539 $ 5,059 $ 1,480 Investing activities (1,458) (1,648) 190 Financing activities (3,559) (3,036) (523) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 72 (60) 132 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,594 $ 315 $ 1,279 Operating activities: The $1,480 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flows was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Investing activities: The $190 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to increased proceeds from investments and lower spending on purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by higher spending on business acquisitions and investments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $523 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of May 31, 2021, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility (1) $ 3,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,228 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 255 — Total $ 4,483 $ — Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) On April 26, 2021, we replaced our $1,000 syndicated 5-year credit facility and $1,000 syndicated 364-day credit facility with a new $3,000 syndicated credit facility maturing on April 24, 2026. This facility provides unsecured, revolving credit capacity for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under this facility will accrue interest at the applicable risk-free rate, plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees. As of May 31, 2021, we had no borrowings under the facility. Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $674 million of letters of credit outstanding as of May 31, 2021. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2.

These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the nine months ended May 31, 2021, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2021. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 3.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we purchased 2,840,792 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of $786 million. The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date. (3) As of May 31, 2021, our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $4,179 million, which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs. Since August 2001 and as of May 31, 2021, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $40.1 billion for share purchases and redemptions by Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. (4) During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, Accenture purchased 165,086 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 11 1. Basis Of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 22, 2020. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2021. Allowance for Credit Losses - Client Receivables and Contract Assets We record client receivables and contract assets at their face amounts less an allowance for credit losses. The allowance represents our estimate of expected credit losses based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information. As of February 28, 2021 and August 31, 2020, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 39,480 and $ 40,277 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Concentrations of Credit Risk Our financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments and client receivables, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: February 28, 2021 August 31, 2020 Equity method investments $ 181,238 $ 240,446 Investments without readily determinable fair values 124,924 84,068 Total non-current investments $ 306,162 $ 324,514 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of other income (expense), net. Our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. As of February 28, 2021 and August 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our investment was $ 171,956 and $ 230,219 , and the estimated fair value of our approximately 16 % and 22 % ownership was $ 847,172 and $ 956,308 , respectively. We Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 12 account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship. Depreciation and Amortization As of February 28, 2021 and August 31, 2020, total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,522,213 and $ 2,313,731 , respectively. See table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for the three and six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively. Three Months Ended Six Months Ended February 28, 2021 February 29, 2020 February 28, 2021 February 29, 2020 Depreciation $ 119,490 $ 122,592 $ 253,408 $ 219,682 Amortization - Deferred transition 81,617 78,754 162,973 146,668 Amortization - Intangible assets 73,746 55,799 140,953 109,171 Other - Operating lease cost 182,922 184,971 368,641 366,053 Total depreciation, amortization and other $ 457,775 $ 442,116 $ 925,975 $ 841,574 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13 (“Topic 326”) On September 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which amends guidance on recognition and measurement of credit losses and related disclosures. The amendments replace the existing incurred loss impairment model with a methodology to measure and recognize lifetime expected credit losses for all in-scope financial assets, including accounts receivable and contract assets. The adoption did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 21 billion and $ 20 billion as of February 28, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 54 % of our remaining performance obligations as of February 28, 2021 as revenue in fiscal 2021, an additional 25 % in fiscal 2022, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 685,193 and $ 690,931 as of February 28, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 714,586 and $ 723,168 as of February 28, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of February 28, 2021 As of August 31, 2020 Receivables $ 7,986,153 $ 7,192,110 Contract assets (current) 739,239 654,782 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 8,725,392 7,846,892 Contract assets (non-current) 44,485 43,257 Deferred revenues (current) 4,181,625 3,636,741 Deferred revenues (non-current) 685,193 690,931 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the six months ended February 28, 2021, were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2021 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2020 and August 31, 2020 were $ 2.0 billion and $ 2.8 billion, respectively. Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 29, 2020 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019 were $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.4 billion, respectively.

The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 18 8. Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 3,789 and net gains $ 24,535 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2021, respectively, and net gains of $ 1,461 and net losses of $ 55,158 for the three and six months ended February 29, 2020, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: February 28, 2021 August 31, 2020 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 73,478 $ 75,871 Other non-current assets 31,365 50,914 Other Derivatives Other current assets 14,244 27,964 Total assets $ 119,087 $ 154,749 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 22,391 $ 13,614 Other non-current liabilities 28,335 13,576 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 36,320 11,828 Total liabilities $ 87,046 $ 39,018 Total fair value $ 32,041 $ 115,731 Total notional value $ 9,804,987 $ 9,600,691 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: February 28, 2021 August 31, 2020 Net derivative assets $ 82,515 $ 129,520 Net derivative liabilities 50,474 13,789 Total fair value $ 32,041 $ 115,731 Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 19 9. Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for both the three months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 were 17.1 %. Absent the $ 151,309 and $ 52,700 gains on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies and related $ 18,534 and $ 8,549 in tax expense, our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 would have been 17.5 % and 17.1 %, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2021 included higher tax expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes. Our effective tax rates for the six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 were 20.4 % and 20.6 %, respectively. Absent the $ 271,009 and $ 113,192 gains on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies and related $ 41,440 and $ 18,732 in tax expense, our effective tax rates for both the six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 would have been 20.8 %. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of February 28, 2021 and August 31, 2020, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 881,000 and $ 832,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 80,000 and $ 87,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of February 28, 2021, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 21 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2021” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2021. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not limited to those identified below. For a discussion of risks and actions taken in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, see the “Overview” below and “ Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. ” under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. Many of the following risks, uncertainties and other factors identified below are, and will be, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. • Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 22 • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 23 Overview The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant loss of life, disrupted businesses and restricted travel worldwide, causing significant economic disruption and uncertainty. The pandemic impacted almost all aspects of our business and forced us to quickly adapt the way we operate. We took actions to shift the vast majority of our workforce to a remote working environment to ensure the continuity of our business and to respond to a rapidly changing demand environment from our clients. We continue to implement and evolve our comprehensive plan to return to our and our clients’ offices where permissible, with our people’s safety and the needs of our clients guiding how we manage our phased transition. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we continued to experience increased demand in the Public Service, Software & Platforms, Banking & Capital Markets and Life Sciences industries. During the quarter we also saw some clients continue to reprioritize and delay certain work as a result of the pandemic, particularly in the Travel and Energy industries and primarily for our consulting services. For further information on the impact to our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, please see “Summary of Results” below. For a discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.” under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. Summary of Results Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 8% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2021 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 29, 2020. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced revenues approximately 2% during the three and six months ended February 28, 2021. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, revenue growth in local currency was strong in North America and Growth Markets and modest in Europe. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service and Financial Services, strong in Communications, Media & Technology and modest in Products, partially offset by a decline in Resources. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and slight in consulting during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The business environment remained competitive and, in some areas, we experienced pricing pressures. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Consulting revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2021 increased 2% in U.S. dollars and decreased 1% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 29, 2020. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced consulting revenues approximately 3% during the three and six months ended February 28, 2021. Consulting revenue in local currency for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was driven by solid growth in Growth Markets and modest growth in Europe, partially offset by a slight decline in North America. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. In our outsourcing business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Outsourcing revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2021 increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 29, 2020. Outsourcing revenue in local currency for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was led by very strong growth in North America, strong growth in Growth Markets and solid growth in Europe. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2021 compared to the three and six months ended February 29, 2020, resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 3% and 2% higher, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2021, we estimate that our full fiscal 2021 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% higher than our revenue growth in local currency. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was 94%, up from 91% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, increased to approximately 537,000 as of February 28, 2021, compared to approximately 509,000 as of February 29, 2020. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was 12%, down from 14% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was 29.7%, compared with 30.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2021 was 31.4% compared with 31.1% for the six months ended February 29, 2020. The decrease in gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was due to an increase in labor costs, including a one-time bonus equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level, partially offset by lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2021 was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs, including a one-time bonus equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and 16.6% for the six months ended February 28, 2021, compared with 16.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 16.7% for the six months ended February 29, 2020. For the second quarter and six months ended February 28, 2021, compared to the same period in fiscal 2020, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 100 and 60 basis points, respectively, primarily due to lower selling and other business development costs, including lower travel costs. For the second quarter and six months ended February 28, 2021, compared to the same periods in fiscal 2020, General and administrative costs increased 20 and 40 basis points, respectively. The increase in General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2021 was primarily due to higher labor and technology costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was 13.7%, compared with 13.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2021 was 14.9%, compared with 14.5% for the six months ended February 29, 2020. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $151 million and $53 million and related tax expense of $19 million and $9 million, respectively, related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. During the six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, we recorded gains of $271 million and $113 million and related tax expense of $41 million and $19 million, respectively, related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The effective tax rates for both the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 17.1%. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 would have been 17.5% and 17.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2021 was 20.4%, compared with 20.6% for the six months ended February 29, 2020. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rates for both the six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 would have been 20.8%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.23 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with $1.91 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The $133 million and $44 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 and $0.07 during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $2.03 and $1.84 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Diluted earnings per share Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 were $4.55 for the six months ended February 28, 2021, compared with $4.00 for the six months ended February 29, 2020. The $230 million and $94 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.35 and $0.15 during the six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.20 and $3.85 for the six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively. We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of gains related to an investment for both fiscal 2021 and 2020, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance when comparing these periods. New Bookings New bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 were $16.0 billion, with consulting bookings of $8.0 billion and outsourcing bookings of $8.0 billion.

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Revenues Revenues were impacted by a reduction of approximately 2% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 across all markets. The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms, Banking & Capital Markets and Communications & Media. These increases were partially offset by declines in Energy and Chemicals & Natural Resources. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 3% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Life Sciences, Software & Platforms, Public Service and Health. These increases were partially offset by declines in High Tech and Chemicals & Natural Resources. Revenue growth was driven by Italy, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. • Growth Markets revenues increased 6% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Banking & Capital Markets, High Tech and Health. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Energy. Revenue growth was driven by Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $782 million, or 8%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 86.3% from 86.6% during this period. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2.

Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 decreased to 29.7% from 30.2% during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The decrease in gross margin was due to an increase in labor costs, including a one-time bonus equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level, partially offset by lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 decreased $23 million, or 2%, from the second quarter of fiscal 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.4% from 10.4% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower selling and other business development costs, including lower travel costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $95 million, or 13%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2020, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.6% from 6.4% during this period. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $165 million, or 11%, over the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended February 28, 2021 February 29, 2020 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 772 14 % $ 732 14 % $ 40 Europe 503 12 383 11 120 Growth Markets 378 16 374 17 5 Total $ 1,654 13.7 % $ 1,489 13.4 % $ 165 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The reduction in travel costs during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 had a favorable impact on operating income. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 each geographic market's operating income was unfavorably impacted by higher labor costs, including a one-time bonus equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2020: • North America operating income increased primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth, higher consulting contract profitability and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 28 Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, other income (expense), net increased $101,651 over the second quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher gains on investments. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Income Tax Expense The effective tax rates for both the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 were 17.1%. Absent the $151 million and $53 million gains on an investment and related $19 million and $9 million in tax expense, our effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 would have been 17.5% and 17.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2021 included higher tax expense from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, partially offset by changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.23 for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with $1.91 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.

In addition, during the six months ended February 28, 2021 each geographic market's operating income was unfavorably impacted by higher labor costs, including a one-time bonus equal to one week of base pay for all employees below the managing director level. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the six months ended February 28, 2021 compared with the six months ended February 29, 2020: • North America operating income increased primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth, higher consulting contract profitability and lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth and higher contract profitability. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 31 • Growth Markets operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by the higher labor costs described above and lower consulting contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the six months ended February 28, 2021, other income (expense), net increased $184,579 over the six months ended February 29, 2020, primarily due to higher gains on investments and lower foreign exchange losses. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2021 was 20.4%, compared with 20.6% for the six months ended February 29, 2020. Absent the $271 million and $113 million gains on an investment and related $41 million and $19 million in tax expense, our effective tax rates for both the six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 would have been 20.8%. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2021 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.0% to 25.0%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $4.55 for the six months ended February 28, 2021, compared with $4.00 for the six months ended February 29, 2020.

Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $4.20 and $3.85 for the six months ended February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020, respectively. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share FY20 As Reported $ 4.00 Higher revenue and operating results 0.35 Higher gains on an investment, net of tax 0.21 Lower share count 0.02 Lower non-operating income (0.01) Higher non-controlling interest (0.01) FY21 As Reported $ 4.55 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of February 28, 2021, Cash and cash equivalents was $9.2 billion, compared with $8.4 billion as of August 31, 2020. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Six Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) February 28, 2021 February 29, 2020 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,138 $ 2,318 $ 1,820 Investing activities (886) (763) (123) Financing activities (2,546) (2,238) (309) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 46 (7) 53 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 751 $ (690) $ 1,442 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $1,820 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in accounts payable and the accrual of a one-time bonus. Investing activities: The $123 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments, partially offset by increased proceeds from investments and lower spending on purchases of property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $309 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of February 28, 2021, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility $ 1,000 $ — 364-day syndicated loan facility 1,000 — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,077 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 249 — Total $ 3,325 $ — Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $543 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 28, 2021. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 33 Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the six months ended February 28, 2021 is as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Shares Amount Shares Amount Open-market share purchases (1) 5,544,055 $ 1,342 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 19,529 5 Other purchases (2) 2,419,860 606 — — Total 7,963,915 $ 1,948 19,529 $ 5 (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the six months ended February 28, 2021, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2021. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 3.

Since August 2001 and as of February 28, 2021, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $40.1 billion for share purchases and redemptions by Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. (4) During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Accenture purchased 1,944,571 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans.

Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 9 1. Basis Of Presentation The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 22, 2020. The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2021. Allowance for Credit Losses - Client Receivables and Contract Assets We record client receivables and contract assets at their face amounts less an allowance for credit losses. The allowance represents our estimate of expected credit losses based on historical experience, current economic conditions and certain forward-looking information. As of November 30, 2020 and August 31, 2020, the total allowance for credit losses recorded for client receivables and contract assets was $ 38,315 and $ 40,277 , respectively. The change in the allowance is primarily due to immaterial write-offs and changes in gross client receivables and contract assets. Concentrations of Credit Risk Our financial instruments, consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents, foreign currency exchange rate instruments and client receivables, are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We place our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange instruments with highly-rated financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct ongoing evaluations of the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. Client receivables are dispersed across many different industries and countries; therefore, concentrations of credit risk are limited. Investments All available-for-sale securities and liquid investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered to be Short-term investments. Non-current investments consist of equity securities in publicly-traded and privately-held companies and are accounted for using either the equity or fair value measurement alternative method of accounting (for investments without readily determinable fair values). Our non-current investments are as follows: November 30, 2020 August 31, 2020 Equity method investments $ 211,765 $ 240,446 Investments without readily determinable fair values 87,141 84,068 Total non-current investments $ 298,906 $ 324,514 For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and our proportionate share of gains and losses of the investee are included as a component of other income (expense), net. Our equity method investments consist primarily of an investment in Duck Creek Technologies. As of November 30, 2020 and August 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our investment was $ 201,810 and $ 230,219 , and the estimated fair value of our approximately 19 % and 22 % ownership was $ 850,825 and $ 956,308 , respectively. Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 10 We account for the investment under the equity method because we have the ability to influence operations through the combination of our voting power and through other factors, such as representation on the board and our business relationship. Depreciation and Amortization As of November 30, 2020 and August 31, 2020, total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,414,951 and $ 2,313,731 , respectively. See table below for summary of depreciation on fixed assets, deferred transition amortization, intangible assets amortization and operating lease cost for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Three Months Ended November 30, 2020 November 30, 2019 Depreciation $ 133,918 $ 97,090 Amortization - Deferred transition 81,356 67,914 Amortization - Intangible assets 67,207 53,372 Other - Operating lease cost 185,719 181,082 Total depreciation, amortization and other $ 468,200 $ 399,458 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13 (“Topic 326”) On September 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which amends guidance on recognition and measurement of credit losses and related disclosures. The amendments replace the existing incurred loss impairment model with a methodology to measure and recognize lifetime expected credit losses for all in-scope financial assets, including accounts receivable and contract assets. The adoption did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenues Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 19 billion and $ 20 billion as of November 30, 2020 and August 31, 2020, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 62 % of our remaining performance obligations as of November 30, 2020 as revenue in fiscal 2021, an additional 19 % in fiscal 2022, and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 668,267 and $ 690,931 as of November 30, 2020 and August 31, 2020, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $ 715,897 and $ 723,168 as of November 30, 2020 and August 31, 2020, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of November 30, 2020 As of August 31, 2020 Receivables $ 7,799,770 $ 7,192,110 Contract assets (current) 747,941 654,782 Receivables and contract assets, net of allowance (current) 8,547,711 7,846,892 Contract assets (non-current) 44,517 43,257 Deferred revenues (current) 3,524,781 3,636,741 Deferred revenues (non-current) 668,267 690,931 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the three months ended November 30, 2020, were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2020 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2020 were $ 2.0 billion. Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2019 were $ 1.8 billion.

The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on our operations were not material. 6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable operating segment are as follows: August 31, 2020 Additions/ Adjustments Foreign Currency Translation November 30, 2020 North America $ 4,604,441 $ 225,619 $ 647 $ 4,830,707 Europe 2,138,088 120,090 9,356 2,267,534 Growth Markets 967,291 48,909 12,970 1,029,170 Total $ 7,709,820 $ 394,618 $ 22,973 $ 8,127,411 Goodwill includes immaterial adjustments related to prior period acquisitions.

The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 16 8. Financial Instruments Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019, as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net gains of $ 28,324 and net losses $ 56,619 for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments are as follows: November 30, 2020 August 31, 2020 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 79,405 $ 75,871 Other non-current assets 50,138 50,914 Other Derivatives Other current assets 42,697 27,964 Total assets $ 172,240 $ 154,749 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 12,883 $ 13,614 Other non-current liabilities 12,691 13,576 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 5,428 11,828 Total liabilities $ 31,002 $ 39,018 Total fair value $ 141,238 $ 115,731 Total notional value $ 9,367,230 $ 9,600,691 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows: November 30, 2020 August 31, 2020 Net derivative assets $ 159,030 $ 129,520 Net derivative liabilities 17,792 13,789 Total fair value $ 141,238 $ 115,731 Table of Contents Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q 17 9. Income Taxes We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2020 and 2019 were 23.4 % and 23.6 %, respectively. Absent the $ 119,700 and $ 60,492 gains on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies and related $ 22,906 and $ 10,183 in tax expense, our effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 would have been 23.7 % and 23.9 %, respectively. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of November 30, 2020 and August 31, 2020, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 848,000 and $ 832,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 81,000 and $ 87,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of November 30, 2020, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. On October 27, 2020, the court issued an order largely denying Accenture’s motion to dismiss the claims against us. We continue to believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. At present, we do not believe any losses from this matter will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 19 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020, and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “fiscal 2021” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2021. All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not limited to those identified below. For a discussion of risks and actions taken in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, see the “Overview” below and “ Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. ” under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. Many of the following risks, uncertainties and other factors identified below are, and will be, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. • Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. • Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security incidents or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 20 • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies or fail to satisfy certain agreed-upon targets or specific service levels. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. • We are incorporated in Ireland and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to our shareholders. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 21 Overview The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant loss of life, disrupted businesses and restricted travel worldwide, causing significant economic disruption and uncertainty. This disruption and uncertainty has had and continues to have a significant adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results. The pandemic impacted almost all aspects of our business and forced us to quickly adapt the way we operate. As described below, we took actions to shift the majority of our workforce to a remote working environment to ensure the continuity of our business, including the sales and delivery of services to our clients, and to respond to a rapidly changing demand environment from our clients. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we enabled approximately 95% of our global workforce to work from home and suspended substantially all business travel. We continue to implement and evolve our comprehensive plan to return to our and our clients’ offices where permissible, with our people’s safety and the needs of our clients guiding how we manage our phased transition. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our revenues increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency. While this represented slower growth compared to 9% growth in local currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, it was an improvement compared to flat revenue growth for the second half of fiscal 2020. We continued to experience reduced demand for our services during the quarter as some clients reprioritized and delayed certain work as a result of the pandemic, particularly in the Travel, Energy, High Tech, Retail and Industrial industries and primarily for our consulting services. We also experienced increased demand in the Public Service, Software & Platforms, Banking & Capital Markets and Life Sciences industries and from clients across all of our industry groups in connection with their digital transformations, the adoption of cloud technologies and security-related services. In this current market, the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services while deploying skilled teams of professionals effectively. For further information on the impact to our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, please see “Summary of Results” below. For a discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.” under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2020. Summary of Results Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced revenues approximately 2%. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, revenue growth in local currency was solid in North America and modest in Growth Markets, partially offset by a slight decline in Europe. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service, solid in Financial Services and modest in Communications, Media & Technology, partially offset by a decline in Resources and a modest decline in Products. Revenue growth in local currency was strong in outsourcing, partially offset by a slight decline in consulting during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The business environment remained competitive, and the changes in demand have led to continued pricing pressure, particularly for our consulting services. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced consulting revenues approximately 3%. The decline in consulting revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was driven by modest declines in North America and Europe, partially offset by slight growth in Growth Markets. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by helping our clients accelerate their digital transformation, including moving to the cloud, embedding security across the enterprise and adopting new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to accelerate growth and improve customer experiences. In our outsourcing business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 9% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Outsourcing revenue in local currency for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was led by very strong growth in North America, strong growth in Growth Markets and modest growth in Europe. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar weakened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 22 resulting in favorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% higher than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2021, we estimate that our full fiscal 2021 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% higher than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 93%, up from 91% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, increased to approximately 514,000 as of November 30, 2020, compared to approximately 505,000 as of November 30, 2019. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 9%, down from 14% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 33.1%, compared with 32.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 17.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with 16.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. For the first quarter, compared to the same period in fiscal 2020, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 10 basis points and General and administrative costs increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher labor and technology costs as a percentage of revenues. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 16.1%, compared with 15.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $120 million and $60 million and related tax expense of $23 million and $10 million, respectively, related to our investment in Duck Creek Technologies. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 23.4%, compared with 23.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Absent the investment gains and related tax expense, our effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 would have been 23.7% and 23.9%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share were $2.32 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with $2.09 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The $97 million and $50 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.15 and $0.08 during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been $2.17 and $2.01 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have presented our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of gains related to an investment for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior period. New Bookings New bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were $12.9 billion, with consulting bookings of $6.6 billion and outsourcing bookings of $6.3 billion. New bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were $10.3 billion, with consulting bookings of $6.0 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.3 billion. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2.

(1) Effective September 1, 2020, we revised the reporting of our industry groups to include amounts previously reported in Other. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Revenues Revenues were impacted by a reduction of approximately 2% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 across all markets. The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020: Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 4% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms, Banking & Capital Markets and Life Sciences. These increases were partially offset by declines in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services, Energy, Chemicals & Natural Resources and High Tech. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues decreased 1% in local currency, led by declines in High Tech, Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Industrial. These decreases were partially offset by growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms and Health. The decline in revenues was driven by Spain and France, partially offset by growth in Italy and Switzerland. • Growth Markets revenues increased 3% in local currency, led by growth in Banking & Capital Markets, Public Service, Utilities, High Tech and Health. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by Japan, as well as Australia. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $280 million, or 3%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 83.9% from 84.4% during this period. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 Operating expenses by category are as follows: Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2020 November 30, 2019 Increase (Decrease) Operating Expenses $ 9,872 83.9 % $ 9,592 84.4 % $ 280 Cost of services 7,864 66.9 7,711 67.9 153 Sales and marketing 1,227 10.4 1,191 10.5 36 General and administrative costs 780 6.6 689 6.1 91 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Cost of Services Cost of services for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $153 million, or 2%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 66.9% from 67.9% during this period. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased to 33.1% from 32.1% during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $36 million, or 3%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 10.4% from 10.5% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $91 million, or 13%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.6% from 6.1% during this period. The increase was primarily due to higher labor and technology costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased $123 million, or 7%, over the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets are as follows: Three Months Ended November 30, 2020 November 30, 2019 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) North America $ 889 16 % $ 828 16 % $ 60 Europe 629 16 559 15 70 Growth Markets 372 16 380 17 (7) Total $ 1,891 16.1 % $ 1,767 15.6 % $ 123 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The reduction in travel costs during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 had a favorable impact on operating income. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2020: • North America operating income increased primarily due to outsourcing revenue growth. • Europe operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability. • Growth Markets operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower consulting contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, other income (expense), net increased $82,928 over the first quarter of fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher gains on investments and lower foreign exchange losses. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 25 Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was 23.4%, compared with 23.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Absent the $120 million and $60 million gains on an investment and related $23 million and $10 million in tax expense, our effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 would have been 23.7% and 23.9%, respectively. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2021 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.0% to 25.0%. The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.32 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, compared with $2.09 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The $97 million and $50 million gains on an investment, net of taxes, increased diluted earnings per share by $0.15 and $0.08 during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the impact of these gains, diluted earnings per share would have been 2.17 and $2.01 for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The increase in diluted earnings per share is due to the following factors: Earnings Per Share Q1 FY20 As Reported $ 2.09 Higher revenue and operating results 0.14 Higher gains on an investment, net of tax 0.07 Lower share count 0.01 Lower effective tax rate 0.01 Q1 FY21 As Reported $ 2.32 Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of November 30, 2020, Cash and cash equivalents was $8.6 billion, compared with $8.4 billion as of August 31, 2020. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Three Months Ended (in millions of U.S. dollars) November 30, 2020 November 30, 2019 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,603 $ 787 $ 816 Investing activities (446) (166) (281) Financing activities (999) (948) (51) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 22 11 11 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 179 $ (316) $ 495 Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $816 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Investing activities: The $281 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions, partially offset by increased proceeds from investments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $51 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in cash dividends paid as well as an increase in the net purchases of shares, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of November 30, 2020, we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: (in millions of U.S. dollars) Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities Syndicated loan facility $ 1,000 $ — 364-day syndicated loan facility 1,000 — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 1,060 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 248 — Total $ 3,308 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $515 million of letters of credit outstanding as of November 30, 2020. Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 27 Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the three months ended November 30, 2020 is as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Shares Amount Shares Amount Open-market share purchases (1) 2,865,941 $ 661 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 2,130 — Other purchases (2) 475,289 108 — — Total 3,341,230 $ 768 2,130 $ — Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the three months ended November 30, 2020, as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2021. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Table of Contents ACCENTURE FORM 10-Q Item 3.

(2) Since August 2001, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized and periodically confirmed a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we purchased 2,865,941 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of $661 million. The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date. (3) As of November 30, 2020, our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $5,654 million, which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs. Since August 2001 and as of November 30, 2020, the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $40.1 billion for share purchases and redemptions by Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. (4) During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, Accenture purchased 475,289 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs.

except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 29, 2019 . The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2020 . Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) and Note 12 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the change in our reportable segments. Allowance for Client Receivables As of May 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , total allowance recorded for client receivables was $ 37,468 and $ 45,538 , respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense was $ 119,148 and $ 338,830 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020 , respectively, and $ 109,398 and $ 322,746 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 , respectively. As of May 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,238,805 and $ 1,956,029 , respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $ 71,278 and $ 217,946 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020 , respectively, and $ 67,225 and $ 204,313 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 , respectively. See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances. 11 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 and related updates (“Topic 842”) On September 1, 2019 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and related updates (“Topic 842”) using the effective date method. Prior period amounts were not adjusted. The primary impact of adoption is the requirement for lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by both operating and finance leases. Enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements are also required. We elected the package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease classification or initial direct costs. We also elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components, accounting for the combined components as a single lease component, for our office real estate and automobile leases. The standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statement. The impact of adopting Topic 842 on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: Balance Sheet Balance as of August 31, 2019 Adjustments due to ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842) Balance as of September 1, 2019 CURRENT ASSETS Other current assets $ 1,225,364 $ ( 38,666 ) $ 1,186,698 NON-CURRENT ASSETS Lease assets — 3,169,608 3,169,608 Other non-current assets 1,400,292 ( 10,333 ) 1,389,959 CURRENT LIABILITIES Lease liabilities — 699,399 699,399 Other accrued liabilities 951,450 ( 703 ) 950,747 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Lease liabilities — 2,666,344 2,666,344 Other non-current liabilities 526,988 ( 244,431 ) 282,557 See Note 7 (Leases) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. FASB ASU No. 2018-15 ( “Subtopic 350-40”) On September 1, 2019 , we prospectively adopted FASB ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 clarifies and aligns the accounting and capitalization of implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements that are service arrangements with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software under ASC No. 350-40. Implementation costs that are currently capitalized in software licensing arrangements (e.g. costs to configure the software) will be capitalized in cloud computing arrangements, and costs expensed in software license arrangements (e.g. data conversion, training, and business process re-engineering) will be expensed in cloud computing arrangements. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 12 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 2. REVENUES Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 12 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 19 billion and $ 20 billion as of May 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 36 % of our remaining performance obligations as of May 31, 2020 as revenue in fiscal 2020 , an additional 36 % in fiscal 2021 , and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019 , respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 638,821 and $ 563,245 as of May 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $ 704,282 and $ 681,492 as of May 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables, Contract assets and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of May 31, 2020 As of August 31, 2019 Receivables, net of allowance $ 7,677,366 $ 7,467,338 Contract assets (current) 668,235 627,733 Receivables and contract assets (current) 8,345,601 8,095,071 Contract assets (non-current) 52,701 71,002 Deferred revenues (current) 3,536,521 3,188,835 Deferred revenues (non-current) 638,821 565,224 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the nine months ended May 31, 2020 , were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 29, 2020 and August 31, 2019 were $ 1.9 billion and $ 2.6 billion , respectively . Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2019 and September 1, 2018 were $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.7 billion , respectively. 13 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 3.

LEASES We account for leases in accordance with Topic 842. See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our adoption. As a lessee, substantially all of our lease obligation is for office real estate. Our significant judgments used in determining our lease obligation include whether a contract is or contains a lease and the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability. Our leases may include the option to extend or terminate before the end of the contractual term and are often non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties. Our lease assets and liabilities include these options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. In certain cases, we sublease excess office real estate to third-party tenants. Lease assets and liabilities recognized at the lease commencement date are determined predominantly as the present value of the payments due over the lease term. Since we cannot determine the implicit rate in our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate on that date to calculate the present value. Our incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate at which we could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to our lease payments in a similar economic environment. Effective September 1, 2019 , when we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs or lease incentives. Fixed and variable payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate. Other variable payments, such as common area maintenance, property and other taxes, utilities and insurance that are based on the lessor’s cost, are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period incurred. As of May 31, 2020 , we had no material finance leases. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease costs were as follows: Three Months Ended May 31, 2020 Nine Months Ended May 31, 2020 Operating lease cost $ 191,351 $ 557,404 Variable lease cost 42,537 137,940 Sublease income ( 6,831 ) ( 19,391 ) $ 227,057 $ 675,953 Supplemental information related to operating lease transactions was as follows: Nine Months Ended May 31, 2020 Lease liability payments $ 535,549 Lease assets obtained in exchange for liabilities $ 486,739 As of May 31, 2020 , our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.5 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.3 % . 17 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) The following maturity analysis presents future undiscounted cash outflows for operating leases as of May 31, 2020 : Lease Payments Sublease Receipts 2020 (Remainder) $ 179,590 $ ( 5,479 ) 2021 744,328 ( 16,026 ) 2022 626,354 ( 8,061 ) 2023 523,343 ( 7,618 ) 2024 439,048 ( 7,181 ) Thereafter 1,474,890 ( 31,050 ) Total lease payments (receipts) 3,987,553 $ ( 75,415 ) Less interest ( 544,371 ) Total lease liabilities $ 3,443,182 As of May 31, 2020 , we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $ 474 million that are not reflected in the table above. These leases are primarily related to office real estate and will commence in or before fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of up to 16 years. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as of August 31, 2019 , which were accounted for in accordance with Topic 840, were as follows: Lease Payments Sublease Receipts 2020 $ 688,020 $ ( 24,884 ) 2021 597,307 ( 17,908 ) 2022 516,544 ( 8,535 ) 2023 428,481 ( 7,541 ) 2024 363,107 ( 7,184 ) Thereafter 1,246,097 ( 30,708 ) $ 3,839,556 $ ( 96,760 ) 18 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 8.

Subsequent Event On June 24, 2020 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.80 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on July 16, 2020 payable on August 14, 2020 . The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. 9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019 , as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net gains of $ 17,132 and net losses of $ 38,026 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020 , respectively, and net losses of $ 10,319 and $ 88,247 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 , respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. 19 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: May 31, 2020 August 31, 2019 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 42,750 $ 53,033 Other non-current assets 26,010 49,525 Other Derivatives Other current assets 26,750 8,059 Total assets $ 95,510 $ 110,617 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 38,378 $ 18,826 Other non-current liabilities 30,568 8,770 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 9,093 32,195 Total liabilities $ 78,039 $ 59,791 Total fair value $ 17,471 $ 50,826 Total notional value $ 8,766,370 $ 8,709,917 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows: May 31, 2020 August 31, 2019 Net derivative assets $ 59,781 $ 88,811 Net derivative liabilities 42,310 37,985 Total fair value $ 17,471 $ 50,826 Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We record these investments at cost and remeasure them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $ 133,222 and $ 131,675 as of May 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , respectively . 20 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 10. INCOME TAXES We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2020 and 2019 were 25.5 % and 25.6 % , respectively. The slightly lower effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2020 included benefits from tax law changes offset by the phased-in effects of U.S. tax reform. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 and 2019 were 22.3 % and 21.1 % , respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 was higher primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments. 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of May 31, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 737,000 and $ 794,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 98,000 and $ 128,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of May 31, 2020 , we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, including the putative class action lawsuit discussed below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, at this time. 21 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 12. SEGMENT REPORTING Operating segments are components of an enterprise where separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Our operating segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a strategic business unit providing consulting and outsourcing services to clients across different industries. Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The change is designed to help us better serve our clients and continue to scale our business. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources, which we now refer to as our industry groups. Amounts are attributed to geographic markets based on where clients are located. Information regarding our geographic markets is as follows: Three Months Ended May 31, 2020 North America Europe Growth Markets Total Revenues $ 5,239,275 $ 3,574,995 $ 2,177,035 $ 10,991,305 Depreciation and amortization (2) 91,066 87,895 74,347 253,308 Operating income 720,997 535,463 456,273 1,712,733 Net assets as of May 31 (3) 3,141,914 1,236,004 549,324 4,927,242 Three Months Ended May 31, 2019 North America Europe Growth Markets Total Revenues (1) $ 5,147,948 $ 3,773,835 $ 2,177,905 $ 11,099,688 Depreciation and amortization (2) 74,759 73,994 72,556 221,309 Operating income 881,557 551,665 284,721 1,717,943 Net assets as of May 31 (3) 2,907,951 1,332,909 771,078 5,011,938 Nine Months Ended May 31, 2020 North America Europe Growth Markets Total Revenues $ 15,784,518 $ 10,993,277 $ 6,713,973 $ 33,491,768 Depreciation and amortization (2) 253,018 248,448 227,364 728,830 Operating income 2,281,648 1,477,338 1,209,955 4,968,941 Net assets as of May 31 (3) 3,141,914 1,236,004 549,324 4,927,242 Nine Months Ended May 31, 2019 North America Europe Growth Markets Total Revenues (1) $ 14,758,046 $ 11,125,999 $ 6,275,318 $ 32,159,363 Depreciation and amortization (2) 221,896 213,789 216,907 652,592 Operating income 2,266,963 1,596,776 869,842 4,733,581 Net assets as of May 31 (3) 2,907,951 1,332,909 771,078 5,011,938 _______________ (1) Effective September 1, 2019 we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of one country from Growth Markets to Europe. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. (2) Amounts include depreciation on property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets controlled by each reportable segment, as well as an allocation for amounts they do not directly control. (3) We do not allocate total assets by reportable segment. Reportable segment assets directly attributable to a reportable segment and provided to the chief operating decision makers include receivables and current and non-current contract assets, deferred contract costs and current and non-current deferred revenues. 22 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Revenues by industry group and type of work is as follows: Revenues Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended May 31, 2020 May 31, 2019 May 31, 2020 May 31, 2019 INDUSTRY GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology $ 2,197,152 $ 2,253,136 $ 6,681,968 $ 6,533,319 Financial Services 2,137,850 2,196,595 6,414,211 6,369,477 Health & Public Service 2,015,874 1,819,775 5,932,693 5,283,364 Products 2,998,903 3,077,227 9,376,984 8,912,588 Resources 1,636,606 1,747,977 5,071,450 5,040,143 Other 4,920 4,978 14,462 20,472 Total $ 10,991,305 $ 11,099,688 $ 33,491,768 $ 32,159,363 TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 5,997,894 $ 6,236,630 $ 18,546,448 $ 17,990,967 Outsourcing 4,993,411 4,863,058 14,945,320 14,168,396 Total $ 10,991,305 $ 11,099,688 $ 33,491,768 $ 32,159,363 13. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On June 17, 2020 , we entered into a $ 1 billion 364-day syndicated loan facility, which expires in June 2021. This facility is in addition to our existing $ 1 billion syndicated loan facility, which expires in December 2024. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during fiscal 2020 . In the event of a loan drawn against the new facility, the lenders have the option to require us to repay the loan by issuing public debt within 45 days of their request. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 , and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “ fiscal 2020 ” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2020 . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not limited to those identified below. For a discussion of risks and actions taken in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, see the “Overview” below and “ Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. ” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Many of the following risks, uncertainties and other factors identified below are, and will be, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. • Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. • Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 24 Table of Contents • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • Many of our contracts include fees subject to the attainment of targets or specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. • We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. • Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report and under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Change in Reportable Segments Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. For additional information, see our Form 8-K filed on January 13, 2020. 25 Table of Contents Overview The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant loss of life, disrupted businesses and restricted travel worldwide, causing significant economic disruption and uncertainty. This disruption and uncertainty has had and continues to have a significant adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results. For our third quarter ended May 31, 2020, our revenues declined 1% in U.S. dollars and grew 1% in local currency, a significant decrease when compared to the revenue growth experienced in the first half of this fiscal year. The pandemic impacted almost all aspects of our business and forced us to quickly adapt the way we operate. As described below, we took actions to shift the majority of our workforce to a remote working environment, to ensure the continuity of our business, including the sales and delivery of services to our clients, and to respond to a rapidly changing demand environment from our clients. During the third quarter, we enabled our global workforce to work from home and suspended substantially all business travel. During the quarter, approximately 95% of our people were enabled to work remotely, while a small number of our people providing essential services continued to work from our and our clients’ offices. As governments ease their restrictions, we continue to develop and implement our comprehensive plan to return to our offices. As of June 22, 2020, approximately 35% of our offices were partially open with our people’s safety and the needs of our clients guiding how we manage our phased transition. We experienced reduced demand for our services during the quarter as some clients reprioritized and delayed certain work as a result of the pandemic, particularly in the Travel, Retail, Energy, High Tech and Industrial industries and primarily for our consulting services. We also experienced increased demand in the Public Service, Software & Platforms and Life Sciences industries and from clients across all of our industry groups in connection with their digital transformations, the adoption of cloud technologies and security-related services. In this current market, the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services while deploying skilled teams of professionals effectively on a remote basis. For further information on the impact to our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, please see “Summary of Results” below. For a discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see “ Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. ” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. Summary of Results Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased 1% in U.S. dollars and increased 1% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced revenues approximately 2%. Revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2019 . During the third quarter of fiscal 2020 , revenue growth in local currency was solid in Growth Markets and modest in North America, partially offset by a slight decline in Europe. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service and flat in Financial Services and Communications, Media & Technology, partially offset by a modest decline in Resources and slight decline in Products. Revenue growth in local currency was solid in outsourcing, partially offset by a slight decline in consulting during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 . The business environment remained competitive and, in some areas, we experienced pricing pressures. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced consulting revenues approximately 3%. Consulting revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2019 . The contraction in our consulting revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was led by a decline in Europe and a slight decline in North America, partially offset by strong growth in Growth Markets. Our consulting revenue continues to be driven by digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. In our outsourcing business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . Outsourcing revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2019 . Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth in North America, solid growth in Europe and modest growth in Growth Markets. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. 26 Table of Contents As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2020 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 , resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2020 , we estimate that our full fiscal 2020 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 1.5% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 88% , down from 91% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, increased to approximately 513,000 as of May 31, 2020 , compared to approximately 482,000 as of May 31, 2019 . The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 11% , down from 18% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 32.1% , compared with 31.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 was 31.5% , compared with 30.7% for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 . The increase in gross margin for the third quarter and nine months ended May 31, 2020 was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019 . Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and 16.6% for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 , compared with 16.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 16.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 . For the third quarter , compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 50 basis points, due to lower selling and other business development costs, primarily for travel. For the nine months ended May 31, 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points. For the third quarter and nine months ended May 31, 2020 , compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019 , General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 70 and 50 basis points, respectively, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 15.6% , compared with 15.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 .

Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources, which we now refer to as our industry groups. Revenues by geographic market, industry group and type of work were as follows: Three Months Ended Percent Increase (Decrease) U.S. Dollars Percent Increase (Decrease) Local Currency Percent of Revenues for the Three Months Ended May 31, 2020 May 31, 2019 (1) May 31, 2020 May 31, 2019 (in millions of U.S. dollars) GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS North America $ 5,239 $ 5,148 2 % 2 % 48 % 46 % Europe 3,575 3,774 (5 ) (2 ) 32 34 Growth Markets 2,177 2,178 — 5 20 20 TOTAL REVENUES 10,991 11,100 (1 )% 1 % 100 % 100 % INDUSTRY GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology $ 2,197 $ 2,253 (2 )% — 20 % 20 % Financial Services 2,138 2,197 (3 ) — 20 20 Health & Public Service 2,016 1,820 11 12 % 18 16 Products 2,999 3,077 (3 ) (1 ) 27 28 Resources 1,637 1,748 (6 ) (3 ) 15 16 Other 5 5 n/m n/m — — TOTAL REVENUES $ 10,991 $ 11,100 (1 )% 1 % 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 5,998 $ 6,237 (4 )% (2 )% 55 % 56 % Outsourcing 4,993 4,863 3 5 45 44 TOTAL REVENUES $ 10,991 $ 11,100 (1 )% 1 % 100 % 100 % _______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) Effective September 1, 2019 we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of one country from Growth Markets to Europe. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Revenues Revenues were impacted by a decline in reimbursable travel costs across all markets, which reduced revenues by approximately 2%. The following commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 : Geographic Markets • North America revenues increased 2% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Life Sciences and Software & Platforms. These increases were partially offset by declines in Chemicals & Natural Resources and High Tech. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. • Europe revenues decreased 2% in local currency, led by declines in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Banking & Capital Markets. These decreases were partially offset by growth in Life Sciences, Chemicals & Natural Resources and Software & Platforms. Revenue decline was led by the United Kingdom, Spain and France, partially offset by growth in Italy and Germany. • Growth Markets revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Software & Platforms and Chemicals & Natural Resources. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by Japan. 29 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $103 million , or 1% , over the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.4% from 84.5% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $109 million , or 1% , over the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 67.9% from 68.2% during this period. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased to 32.1% from 31.8% during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . The increase in gross margin was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $66 million , or 6% , over the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 10.2% from 10.7% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower selling and other business development costs, primarily for travel, compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $72 million , or 11% , over the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.3% from 5.6% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 decreased $5 million over the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets were as follows: Three Months Ended May 31, 2020 May 31, 2019 Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) North America $ 721 14 % $ 882 17 % $ (161 ) Europe 535 15 552 15 (16 ) Growth Markets 456 21 285 13 172 TOTAL $ 1,713 15.6 % $ 1,718 15.5 % $ (5 ) _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The reduction in travel costs during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 had a favorable impact on operating income. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2019 : • North America operating income decreased as revenue growth was more than offset by higher labor costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income decreased primarily due to a decline in revenue. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 25.5% , compared with 25.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . The slightly lower effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2020 included benefits from tax law changes offset by the phased-in effects of U.S. tax reform. 30 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $1.90 for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 , compared with $1.93 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . The $0.03 decrease in our diluted earnings per share was due to a decrease of $0.02 from higher non-operating expense, $0.01 from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interests - other and $0.01 from lower revenues and operating results. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended May 31, 2020 Compared to the Nine Months Ended May 31, 2019 Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources, which we now refer to as our industry groups.

Revenue growth was driven by Japan, as well as Brazil. 32 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 increased $1,097 million , or 4% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.2% from 85.3% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 increased $677 million , or 3% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.5% from 69.3% during this period. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 increased to 31.5% from 30.7% during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 . The increase in gross margin was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel, partially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 . Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 increased $198 million , or 6% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.4% from 10.2% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 increased $222 million , or 12% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.3% from 5.8% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 . Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 increased $235 million , or 5% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2019 . Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources . Operating income and operating margin for each of the geographic markets were as follows: Nine Months Ended May 31, 2020 May 31, 2019 Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) North America $ 2,282 14 % $ 2,267 15 % $ 15 Europe 1,477 13 1,597 14 (119 ) Growth Markets 1,210 18 870 14 340 TOTAL $ 4,969 14.8 % $ 4,734 14.7 % $ 235 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the nine months ended May 31, 2020 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The reduction in travel costs during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 had a favorable impact on operating income. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2019 : • North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Europe operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. For the nine months ended May 31, 2020 , other income (expense) increased $67 million over the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , primarily due to gains on investments, partially offset by foreign exchange losses. 33 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 was 22.3% , compared with 21.1% for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 . The higher effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2020 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5% . The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $5.90 for the nine months ended May 31, 2020 , compared with $5.62 for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 . The $0.28 increase in our diluted earnings per share was due to an increase of $0.28 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.08 from higher non-operating income and $0.02 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.09 from a higher effective tax rate and $0.01 from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interests - other. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, 2020 , Cash and cash equivalents was $6.4 billion , compared with $6.1 billion as of August 31, 2019 . Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Nine Months Ended May 31, 2020 May 31, 2019 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 5,059 $ 4,511 $ 548 Investing activities (1,648 ) (1,380 ) (268 ) Financing activities (3,036 ) (3,416 ) 381 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (60 ) (7 ) (53 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 315 $ (292 ) $ 608 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $548 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and the deferral of payments for consumption and payroll taxes in several jurisdictions that adopted COVID-19 related deferral provisions. Investing activities: The $268 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions and property and equipment, partially offset by increased proceeds from investments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $381 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in cash dividends paid due to a change in the frequency of payments from semi-annually to quarterly and an increase in net proceeds from share issuances, partially offset by an increase in net purchase of shares. For additional information, see Note 8 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of May 31, 2020 , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities (in millions of U.S. dollars) Syndicated loan facility $ 1,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 875 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 229 — Total $ 2,104 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $442 million of letters of credit outstanding as of May 31, 2020 . 35 Table of Contents We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $6.4 billion and our cash flows remain very strong. Given the significant economic uncertainty, we supplemented our total available liquidity in June 2020 by adding a $1 billion 364-day syndicated loan facility, which expires in June 2021. This facility is in addition to our existing $1 billion syndicated loan facility, which expires in December 2024. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during fiscal 2020. In the event of a loan drawn against the new facility, the lenders have the option to require us to repay the loan by issuing public debt within 45 days of their request. Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the nine months ended May 31, 2020 was as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Open-market share purchases (1) 9,522,567 $ 1,782 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 36,345 7 Other purchases (2) 2,653,127 537 — — Total 12,175,694 $ 2,319 36,345 $ 7 _______________ (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the nine months ended May 31, 2020 , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2020 . The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 7 (Leases) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 7 includes updates to our leases policy as a result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2016-02. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK During the nine months ended May 31, 2020 , there were no material changes to the information on market risk exposure disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . For a discussion of our market risk associated with foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk as of August 31, 2019 , see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 37 Table of Contents PART II — OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The information set forth under “Legal Contingencies” in Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements,” is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the risk factor below and the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 (the “Annual Report”) . Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, social distancing measures and temporary business closures. The pandemic and the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, a substantial curtailment of business activities, weakened economic conditions, significant economic uncertainty and volatility. The pandemic is significantly adversely impacting and could in the future materially adversely impact our business, operations and financial results. The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that are difficult to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic and the potential for additional outbreaks; how quickly and to what extent normal economic activity can resume; the timing of the development and distribution of an effective vaccine or treatments for COVID-19; government, business and individuals’ actions in response to the pandemic; the prolonged effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions; the degree to which client demand normalizes in a remote work environment; the reprioritization, delay or termination of existing client engagements; and the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions. The closure of our and our clients’ offices, and restrictions inhibiting our people’s ability to access those offices, has disrupted, and will continue to disrupt our ability to sell and provide our services and has resulted in, and may continue to result in, losses of revenue. In response to governmental directives and recommended safety measures, we have enabled most of our employees to work remotely. As governments ease their restrictions, our employees will likely increase their social interactions, including in certain circumstances in our and our clients’ offices. While governments have largely indicated they will ease these restrictions in consultation with public health officials, this may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of increased infection and could result in increased illness among our employees and associated business interruption. Any of these events could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties enumerated in the Annual Report and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Purchases of Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares The following table provides information relating to our purchases of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 .

(2) Since August 2001 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized and periodically confirmed a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020 , we purchased 3,497,566 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of $595 million . The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date. (3) As of May 31, 2020 , our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $1,885 million , which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs. Since August 2001 and as of May 31, 2020 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $35.1 billion for share purchases and redemptions by Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. (4) During the third quarter of fiscal 2020 , Accenture purchased 174,075 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans.

(Unaudited) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 29, 2019 . The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 29, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2020 . Allowances for Client Receivables As of February 29, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , total allowances recorded for client receivables were $ 35,875 and $ 45,538 , respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense was $ 122,592 and $ 219,682 for the three and six months ended February 29, 2020 , respectively, and $ 110,635 and $ 213,348 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 , respectively. As of February 29, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,191,823 and $ 1,956,029 , respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $ 78,754 and $ 146,668 for the three and six months ended February 29, 2020 , respectively, and $ 68,209 and $ 137,088 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 , respectively. See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances. 11 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 and related updates (“Topic 842”) On September 1, 2019 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and related updates (“Topic 842”) using the effective date method. Prior period amounts were not adjusted. The primary impact of adoption is the requirement for lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by both operating and finance leases. Enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements are also required. We elected the package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease classification or initial direct costs. We also elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components, accounting for the combined components as a single lease component, for our office real estate and automobile leases. The standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statement. The impact of adopting Topic 842 on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: Balance Sheet Balance as of August 31, 2019 Adjustments due to ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842) Balance as of September 1, 2019 CURRENT ASSETS Other current assets $ 1,225,364 $ ( 38,666 ) $ 1,186,698 NON-CURRENT ASSETS Lease assets — 3,169,608 3,169,608 Other non-current assets 1,400,292 ( 10,333 ) 1,389,959 CURRENT LIABILITIES Lease liabilities — 699,399 699,399 Other accrued liabilities 951,450 ( 703 ) 950,747 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Lease liabilities — 2,666,344 2,666,344 Other non-current liabilities 526,988 ( 244,431 ) 282,557 See Note 7 (Leases) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. FASB ASU No. 2018-15 ( “Subtopic 350-40”) On September 1, 2019 , we prospectively adopted FASB ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 clarifies and aligns the accounting and capitalization of implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements that are service arrangements with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software under ASC No. 350-40. Implementation costs that are currently capitalized in software licensing arrangements (e.g. costs to configure the software) will be capitalized in cloud computing arrangements, and costs expensed in software license arrangements (e.g. data conversion, training, and business process re-engineering) will be expensed in cloud computing arrangements. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 12 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 2. REVENUES Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 12 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 19 billion and $ 20 billion as of February 29, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 53 % of our remaining performance obligations as of February 29, 2020 as revenue in fiscal 2020 , an additional 24 % in fiscal 2021 , and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and six months ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 , respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 629,505 and $ 563,245 as of February 29, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $ 690,483 and $ 681,492 as of February 29, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables, Contract assets and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of February 29, 2020 As of August 31, 2019 Receivables, net of allowance $ 7,785,957 $ 7,467,338 Contract assets (current) 731,992 627,733 Receivables and contract assets (current) 8,517,949 8,095,071 Contract assets (non-current) 56,503 71,002 Deferred revenues (current) 3,594,142 3,188,835 Deferred revenues (non-current) 629,505 565,224 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the six months ended February 29, 2020 , were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 29, 2020 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019 were $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.4 billion , respectively . Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2018 and September 1, 2018 were $ 1.5 billion and $ 2.4 billion , respectively. 13 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 3.

LEASES We account for leases in accordance with Topic 842. See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our adoption. As a lessee, substantially all of our lease obligation is for office real estate. Our significant judgments used in determining our lease obligation include whether a contract is or contains a lease and the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability. Our leases may include the option to extend or terminate before the end of the contractual term and are often non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties. Our lease assets and liabilities include these options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. In certain cases, we sublease excess office real estate to third-party tenants. Lease assets and liabilities recognized at the lease commencement date are determined predominantly as the present value of the payments due over the lease term. Since we cannot determine the implicit rate in our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate on that date to calculate the present value. Our incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate at which we could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to our lease payments in a similar economic environment. Effective September 1, 2019 , when we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs or lease incentives. Fixed and variable payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate. Other variable payments, such as common area maintenance, property and other taxes, utilities and insurance that are based on the lessor’s cost, are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period incurred. As of February 29, 2020 , we had no material finance leases. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease costs were as follows: Three Months Ended February 29, 2020 Six Months Ended February 29, 2020 Operating lease cost $ 184,971 $ 366,053 Variable lease cost 47,244 95,403 Sublease income ( 6,022 ) ( 12,560 ) Total net lease cost $ 226,193 $ 448,896 Supplemental information related to operating lease transactions was as follows: Six Months Ended February 29, 2020 Lease liability payments $ 357,731 Lease assets obtained in exchange for liabilities $ 267,174 As of February 29, 2020 , our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.2 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.3 % . 17 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) The following maturity analysis presents future undiscounted cash outflows for operating leases as of February 29, 2020 : Lease Payments Sublease Receipts 2020 (Remainder) $ 376,637 $ ( 13,550 ) 2021 709,370 ( 13,234 ) 2022 599,669 ( 7,991 ) 2023 494,367 ( 7,803 ) 2024 414,652 ( 7,457 ) Thereafter 1,318,907 ( 32,391 ) Total lease payments (receipts) 3,913,602 $ ( 82,426 ) Less interest ( 523,273 ) Total lease liabilities $ 3,390,329 As of February 29, 2020 , we have entered into operating leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $ 447 million that are not reflected in the table above. These leases are primarily related to office real estate and will commence in or before fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of up to 17 years.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 , as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net gains of $ 1,461 and net losses $ 55,158 for the three and six months ended February 29, 2020 , respectively, and net losses of $ 28,945 and $ 77,928 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 , respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. 19 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: February 29, 2020 August 31, 2019 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 68,715 $ 53,033 Other non-current assets 55,969 49,525 Other Derivatives Other current assets 30,535 8,059 Total assets $ 155,219 $ 110,617 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 7,555 $ 18,826 Other non-current liabilities 4,148 8,770 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 14,205 32,195 Total liabilities $ 25,908 $ 59,791 Total fair value $ 129,311 $ 50,826 Total notional value $ 8,088,876 $ 8,709,917 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows: February 29, 2020 August 31, 2019 Net derivative assets $ 140,169 $ 88,811 Net derivative liabilities 10,858 37,985 Total fair value $ 129,311 $ 50,826 Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We record these investments at cost and remeasure them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $ 144,846 and $ 131,675 as of February 29, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , respectively . 20 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 10. INCOME TAXES We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rate for both the three months ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 was 17.1 % . The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 29, 2020 included higher tax benefits from share-based payments offset by the phased-in effects of U.S. tax reform and lower benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Our effective tax rates for the six months ended February 29, 2020 and February 28, 2019 were 20.6 % and 18.6 % , respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 29, 2020 was higher due to lower benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities and the phased-in effects of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of February 29, 2020 and August 31, 2019 , our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 699,000 and $ 794,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 117,000 and $ 128,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of February 29, 2020 , we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, including the putative class action lawsuit discussed below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, at this time. 21 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 12.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 , and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “ fiscal 2020 ” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2020 . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include but are not limited to those identified below. For a discussion of risks and actions taken in response to the coronavirus pandemic, see “ Our results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). ” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Many of the following risks, uncertainties and other factors identified below are, and will be, amplified by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). • Our results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). • Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 23 Table of Contents • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • Many of our contracts include fees subject to the attainment of targets or specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. • We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. • Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 24 Table of Contents Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts, to renew and extend existing contracts, and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world. The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has increased that level of volatility and uncertainty globally and has created economic disruption. We are actively managing our business to respond to the impact. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. As announced on January 13, 2020, effective March 1, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which will become our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. For additional information, see our Form 8-K filed on January 13, 2020. Summary of Results Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . Revenues for the six months ended February 29, 2020 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2019 . Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020 , revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Health & Public Service and Products, solid in Communications, Media & Technology and Resources and modest in Financial Services. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Growth Markets and North America and modest in Europe. Revenue growth in local currency was strong in both outsourcing and consulting during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 . While the business environment remained competitive, pricing was relatively stable. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . Consulting revenues for the six months ended February 29, 2020 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2019 . Consulting revenue growth in local currency in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was led by very strong growth in Health & Public Service and Products, modest growth in Resources and Communications, Media & Technology and slight growth in Financial Services. Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. In our outsourcing business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . Outsourcing revenues for the six months ended February 29, 2020 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2019 . Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was led by very strong growth in Resources and strong growth in Health & Public Service, Communications, Media & Technology, Products and Financial Services. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 29, 2020 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 , resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1.0% and 1.4% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay 25 Table of Contents within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2020 , we estimate that our full fiscal 2020 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 1.5% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was 91% , consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 509,000 as of February 29, 2020 , compared to approximately 477,000 as of February 28, 2019 . The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was 14% , down from 15% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was 30.2% , compared with 29.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . Gross margin for the six months ended February 29, 2020 was 31.1% compared with 30.2% for the six months ended February 28, 2019 . The increase in gross margin for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower labor and non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019 . Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 16.7% for the six months ended February 29, 2020 , compared with 16.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 15.8% for the six months ended February 28, 2019 . For both the second quarter and six months ended February 29, 2020 , compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019 , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs. For the second quarter and six months ended February 29, 2020 , compared to the same periods in fiscal 2019 , General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 and 30 basis points, respectively, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was 13.4% , compared with 13.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . Operating margin for the six months ended February 29, 2020 was 14.5% , compared with 14.3% for the six months ended February 28, 2019 . New Bookings New bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 were $14.2 billion , with consulting bookings of $7.2 billion and outsourcing bookings of $7.0 billion . New bookings for the six months ended February 29, 2020 were $24.5 billion , with consulting bookings of $13.2 billion and outsourcing bookings of $11.4 billion . 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended February 29, 2020 Compared to the Three Months Ended February 28, 2019 Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources.

Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019 : Operating Groups • Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 5% in local currency, driven by growth in Software & Platforms across all geographic regions and Communications & Media in North America, partially offset by a decline in High Tech in North America. • Financial Services revenues increased 3% in local currency, driven by growth in Banking & Capital Markets and Insurance in both Growth Markets and North America, partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets in Europe. • Health & Public Service revenues increased 15% in local currency, led by Public Service and Health in North America. • Products revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by growth in Life Sciences across all geographic regions and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services in North America and Growth Markets, as well as Industrial in Growth Markets. 27 Table of Contents • Resources revenues increased 5% in local currency, driven by growth in Energy across all geographic regions, Chemicals & Natural Resources in Europe and Growth Markets and Utilities in North America. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Chemicals & Natural Resources in North America. Geographic Regions • North America revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 2% in local currency, led by Germany, Italy and Ireland, partially offset by a decline in the United Kingdom. • Growth Markets revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by Japan. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $585 million , or 6% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 86.6% from 86.7% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $383 million , or 5% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.8% from 70.8% during this period. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased to 30.2% from 29.2% during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor and non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $143 million , or 14% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2019 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.4% from 9.8% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $60 million , or 9% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2019 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.4% from 6.2% during this period. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $102 million , or 7% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Three Months Ended February 29, 2020 February 28, 2019 Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS (1) Communications, Media & Technology $ 375 17 % $ 368 17 % $ 7 Financial Services 230 11 269 13 (39 ) Health & Public Service 201 10 146 9 55 Products 414 13 375 13 39 Resources 269 16 228 14 41 TOTAL $ 1,489 13.4 % $ 1,387 13.3 % $ 102 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) In connection with the change in our reportable segments, Accenture will begin reporting Operating income by geographic market, rather than operating group, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 28 Table of Contents We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was similar to that disclosed for revenue. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2019 : • Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability. • Financial Services operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower outsourcing contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Health & Public Service operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability. • Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020 , other income (expense) increased $32 million over the second quarter of fiscal 2019 , primarily due to gains on investments. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the second quarter of both fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 17.1% . The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 29, 2020 included higher tax benefits from share-based payments offset by the phased-in effects of U.S. tax reform and lower benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $1.91 for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 , compared with $1.73 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . The $0.18 increase in our diluted earnings per share was due to an increase of $0.14 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.04 from higher non-operating income. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended February 29, 2020 Compared to the Six Months Ended February 28, 2019 Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. As announced on January 13, 2020, effective March 1, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic markets, which will become our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 . Revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) were as follows: Six Months Ended Percent Increase U.S. Dollars Percent Increase Local Currency Percent of Revenues for the Six Months Ended February 29, 2020 February 28, 2019 (1) February 29, 2020 February 28, 2019 (1) (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology $ 4,485 $ 4,280 5 % 6 % 20 % 20 % Financial Services 4,276 4,173 2 4 19 20 Health & Public Service 3,917 3,464 13 14 18 16 Products 6,378 5,835 9 11 28 28 Resources 3,435 3,292 4 6 15 16 Other 10 15 n/m n/m — — TOTAL REVENUES $ 22,500 $ 21,060 7 % 8 % 100 % 100 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS North America $ 10,545 $ 9,610 10 % 10 % 47 % 46 % Europe 7,418 7,352 1 4 33 35 Growth Markets 4,537 4,097 11 12 20 19 TOTAL REVENUES $ 22,500 $ 21,060 7 % 8 % 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 12,549 $ 11,754 7 % 8 % 56 % 56 % Outsourcing 9,952 9,305 7 9 44 44 TOTAL REVENUES $ 22,500 $ 21,060 7 % 8 % 100 % 100 % _______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) Effective September 1, 2019 we revised the reporting of our geographic regions for the movement of one country from Growth Markets to Europe. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the six months ended February 29, 2020 compared to the six months ended February 28, 2019 : Operating Groups • Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 6% in local currency, driven by growth in Software & Platforms across all geographic regions and Communications & Media in Europe and North America, partially offset by a decline in High Tech in North America. • Financial Services revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by growth in Insurance across all geographic regions and Banking & Capital Markets in Growth Markets and North America. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets in Europe. • Health & Public Service revenues increased 14% in local currency, led by Public Service and Health in North America. • Products revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Life Sciences across all geographic regions, led by North America, as well as Industrial in Growth Markets. 30 Table of Contents • Resources revenues increased 6% in local currency, driven by growth in Energy and Utilities across all geographic regions and Chemicals & Natural Resources in Europe and Growth Markets. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Chemicals & Natural Resources in North America. Geographic Regions • North America revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 4% in local currency, led by Italy, Germany and Ireland, partially offset by a decline in the United Kingdom. • Growth Markets revenues increased 12% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as Brazil. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the six months ended February 29, 2020 increased $1,200 million , or 7% , over the six months ended February 28, 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.5% from 85.7% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for the six months ended February 29, 2020 increased $786 million , or 5% , over the six months ended February 28, 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.9% from 69.8% during this period. Gross margin for the six months ended February 29, 2020 increased to 31.1% from 30.2% during the six months ended February 28, 2019 . The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor and non-payroll costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the six months ended February 29, 2020 increased $264 million , or 13% , over the six months ended February 28, 2019 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.5% from 9.9% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the six months ended February 29, 2020 increased $151 million , or 12% , over the six months ended February 28, 2019 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.2% from 5.9% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the six months ended February 29, 2020 increased $241 million , or 8% , over the six months ended February 28, 2019 . Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Six Months Ended February 29, 2020 February 28, 2019 Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS (1) Communications, Media & Technology $ 767 17 % $ 755 18 % $ 11 Financial Services 546 13 630 15 (84 ) Health & Public Service 453 12 343 10 110 Products 936 15 813 14 123 Resources 555 16 474 14 80 TOTAL $ 3,256 14.5 % $ 3,016 14.3 % $ 241 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) In connection with the change in our reportable segments, Accenture will begin reporting Operating income by geographic market, rather than operating group, in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 . 31 Table of Contents We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the six months ended February 29, 2020 was similar to that disclosed for revenue. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for the six months ended February 29, 2020 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2019 : • Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Financial Services operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Health & Public Service operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability. • Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability. • Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher outsourcing contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. For the six months ended February 29, 2020 , other income (expense) increased $77 million over the six months ended February 28, 2019 , primarily due to gains on investments, partially offset by foreign exchange losses. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 29, 2020 was 20.6% , compared with 18.6% for the six months ended February 28, 2019 . The higher effective tax rate for the six months ended February 29, 2020 was primarily due to lower benefits from adjustments to prior year tax liabilities and the phased-in effects of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based payments compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2020 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5% . The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $4.00 for the six months ended February 29, 2020 , compared with $3.69 for the six months ended February 28, 2019 . The $0.31 increase in our diluted earnings per share was due to an increase of $0.30 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.10 from higher non-operating income and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.10 from a higher effective tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 32 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of February 29, 2020 , Cash and cash equivalents was $5.4 billion , compared with $6.1 billion as of August 31, 2019 . Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Six Months Ended February 29, 2020 February 28, 2019 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,318 $ 2,387 $ (70 ) Investing activities (763 ) (725 ) (39 ) Financing activities (2,238 ) (2,294 ) 57 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (7 ) 35 (42 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (690 ) $ (596 ) $ (94 ) _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $70 million year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow was due to higher net income, which was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Investing activities: The $39 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions and property and equipment, partially offset by increased proceeds from investments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $57 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in the net purchase of shares as well as an increase in net proceeds from share issuances, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note 8 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of February 29, 2020 , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities (in millions of U.S. dollars) Syndicated loan facility $ 1,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 830 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 222 — Total $ 2,052 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $430 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 29, 2020 . 33 Table of Contents Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the six months ended February 29, 2020 was as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Open-market share purchases (1) 6,025,001 $ 1,187 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 33,315 7 Other purchases (2) 2,479,052 505 — — Total 8,504,053 $ 1,693 33,315 $ 7 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the six months ended February 29, 2020 , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2020 . The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 7 (Leases) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 7 includes updates to our leases policy as a result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2016-02. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK During the six months ended February 29, 2020 , there were no material changes to the information on market risk exposure disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . For a discussion of our market risk associated with foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk as of August 31, 2019 , see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . 34 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 35 Table of Contents PART II — OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The information set forth under “Legal Contingencies” in Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements,” is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the risk factor below and the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 (the “Annual Report”) . Our results of operations have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant volatility and uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our clients and client demand for our services and solutions; our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions; and any closures of our and our clients’ offices and facilities. For example, in India and the Philippines, we have large concentrations of employees performing critical operations. The closure of those facilities, or restrictions inhibiting our employees’ ability to access those facilities, has disrupted, and could in the future disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, terminations of client contracts and losses of revenue. Clients may also slow down decision making, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements. Any of these events could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties enumerated in the Annual Report and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 3.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 29, 2019 . The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three months ended November 30, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2020 . Allowances for Client Receivables As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019 , total allowances recorded for client receivables were $ 45,016 and $ 45,538 , respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense was $ 97,090 and $ 102,713 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019 , total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,096,462 and $ 1,956,029 , respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $ 67,914 and $ 68,879 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances. 9 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02 and related updates (“Topic 842”) On September 1, 2019 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and related updates (“Topic 842”) using the effective date method. Prior period amounts were not adjusted. The primary impact of adoption is the requirement for lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by both operating and finance leases. Enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements are also required. We elected the package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease classification or initial direct costs. We also elected the practical expedient to combine lease and nonlease components, accounting for the combined components as a single lease component, for our office real estate and automobile leases. The standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statement. The impact of adopting Topic 842 on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: Balance Sheet Balance as of August 31, 2019 Adjustments due to ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842) Balance as of September 1, 2019 CURRENT ASSETS Other current assets $ 1,225,364 $ ( 38,666 ) $ 1,186,698 NON-CURRENT ASSETS Lease assets — 3,169,608 3,169,608 Other non-current assets 1,400,292 ( 10,333 ) 1,389,959 CURRENT LIABILITIES Lease liabilities — 699,399 699,399 Other accrued liabilities 951,450 ( 703 ) 950,747 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES Lease liabilities — 2,666,344 2,666,344 Other non-current liabilities 526,988 ( 244,431 ) 282,557 See Note 7 (Leases) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. FASB ASU No. 2018-09 ( “Subtopic 350-40”) On September 1, 2019 , we prospectively adopted FASB ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. ASU 2018-15 clarifies and aligns the accounting and capitalization of implementation costs in cloud computing arrangements that are service arrangements with the accounting for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software under ASC No. 350-40. Implementation costs that are currently capitalized in software licensing arrangements (e.g. costs to configure the software) will be capitalized in cloud computing arrangements, and costs expensed in software license arrangements (e.g. data conversion, training, and business process re-engineering) will be expensed in cloud computing arrangements. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 10 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 2. REVENUES Disaggregation of Revenue See Note 12 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. Remaining Performance Obligations We had remaining performance obligations of approximately $ 19 billion and $ 20 billion as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019 , respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 61 % of our remaining performance obligations as of November 30, 2019 as revenue in fiscal 2020 , an additional 19 % in fiscal 2021 , and the balance thereafter. Contract Estimates Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Contract Balances Deferred transition revenues were $ 583,531 and $ 563,245 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019 , respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $ 691,727 and $ 681,492 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019 , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables, Contract assets and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): As of November 30, 2019 As of August 31, 2019 Receivables, net of allowance $ 7,908,781 $ 7,467,338 Contract assets (current) 668,605 627,733 Receivables and contract assets (current) 8,577,386 8,095,071 Contract assets (non-current) 58,071 71,002 Deferred revenues (current) 2,986,524 3,188,835 Deferred revenues (non-current) 585,301 565,224 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the three months ended November 30, 2019 , were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of August 31, 2019 were $ 1.8 billion . Revenues recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2018 that were included in Deferred revenues as of September 1, 2018 were $ 1.8 billion . 11 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 3.

LEASES We account for leases in accordance with Topic 842. See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our adoption. As a lessee, substantially all of our lease obligation is for office real estate. Our significant judgments used in determining our lease obligation include whether a contract is or contains a lease and the determination of the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability. Our leases may include the option to extend or terminate before the end of the contractual term and are often non-cancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties. Our lease assets and liabilities include these options in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. In certain cases, we sublease excess office real estate to third-party tenants. Lease assets and liabilities recognized at the lease commencement date are determined predominantly as the present value of the payments due over the lease term. Unless the implicit rate can be determined, we use our incremental borrowing rate on that date to calculate the present value. Our incremental borrowing rate approximates the rate at which we could borrow, on a secured basis for a similar term, an amount equal to our lease payments in a similar economic environment. Effective September 1, 2019 , when we are the lessee, all leases are recognized as lease liabilities and associated lease assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may also include advance payments, initial direct costs or lease incentives. Fixed and variable payments that depend upon an index or rate, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are included in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities at the commencement-date rate. Other variable payments, such as common area maintenance, property and other taxes, utilities and insurance that are based on the lessor’s cost, are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period incurred. As of November 30, 2019 , we had no material finance leases. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease costs were as follows: Three Months Ended November 30, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 181,082 Variable lease cost 48,159 Sublease income ( 6,538 ) Total net lease cost $ 222,703 Supplemental information related to operating lease transactions was as follows: Three Months Ended November 30, 2019 Lease liability payments $ 174,857 Lease assets obtained in exchange for liabilities $ 111,949 As of November 30, 2019 , our operating leases had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.4 years and a weighted average discount rate of 4.2 % . 15 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) The following maturity analysis presents future undiscounted cash outflows for operating leases as of November 30, 2019 : Lease Payments Sublease Receipts 2020 (Remainder) $ 545,128 $ ( 15,789 ) 2021 668,309 ( 15,975 ) 2022 567,493 ( 7,616 ) 2023 463,033 ( 7,493 ) 2024 388,902 ( 7,459 ) Thereafter 1,255,478 ( 32,479 ) Total lease payments (receipts) 3,888,343 $ ( 86,811 ) Less interest ( 525,905 ) Total lease liabilities $ 3,362,438 As of November 30, 2019 , we have entered into operating leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $ 430 million that are not reflected in the table above. These leases are primarily related to office real estate and will commence in or before fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of up to 17 years. Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases as of August 31, 2019 , which were accounted for in accordance with Topic 840, were as follows: Lease Payments Sublease Receipts 2020 $ 688,020 $ ( 24,884 ) 2021 597,307 ( 17,908 ) 2022 516,544 ( 8,535 ) 2023 428,481 ( 7,541 ) 2024 363,107 ( 7,184 ) Thereafter 1,246,097 ( 30,708 ) $ 3,839,556 $ ( 96,760 ) 16 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 8. MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY Dividends Our dividend activity during the three months ended November 30, 2019 was as follows: Dividend Per Share Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Total Cash Outlay Dividend Payment Date Record Date Cash Outlay Record Date Cash Outlay November 15, 2019 $ 0.80 October 17, 2019 $ 507,725 October 15, 2019 $ 656 $ 508,381 The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. Subsequent Event On December 16, 2019 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.80 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on January 16, 2020 payable on February 14, 2020 . The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. 9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 , as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 56,619 and $ 48,983 for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. 17 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: November 30, 2019 August 31, 2019 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 59,675 $ 53,033 Other non-current assets 50,686 49,525 Other Derivatives Other current assets 7,126 8,059 Total assets $ 117,487 $ 110,617 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 9,952 $ 18,826 Other non-current liabilities 6,390 8,770 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 14,292 32,195 Total liabilities $ 30,634 $ 59,791 Total fair value $ 86,853 $ 50,826 Total notional value $ 8,953,147 $ 8,709,917 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows: November 30, 2019 August 31, 2019 Net derivative assets $ 98,125 $ 88,811 Net derivative liabilities 11,272 37,985 Total fair value $ 86,853 $ 50,826 Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We record these investments at cost and remeasure them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $ 149,525 and $ 131,675 as of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019 , respectively . 10. INCOME TAXES We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and 2018 were 23.6 % and 19.8 % , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2019 was higher primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of US tax reform. 18 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of November 30, 2019 and August 31, 2019 , our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 730,000 and $ 794,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 144,000 and $ 128,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of November 30, 2019 , we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, including the putative class action lawsuit discussed below, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. On July 24, 2019, Accenture was named in a putative class action lawsuit filed by consumers of Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleges negligence by us, and seeks monetary damages, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief, relating to a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the reservations database of Starwood Worldwide Resorts, Inc. (“Starwood”), which was acquired by Marriott on September 23, 2016. Since 2009, we have provided certain IT infrastructure outsourcing services to Starwood. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend it. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, at this time. 19 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 12.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 , and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “ fiscal 2020 ” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2020 . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to: • Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 21 Table of Contents • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • Many of our contracts include fees subject to the attainment of targets or specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. • We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. • Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2019 . Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 22 Table of Contents Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts, to renew and extend existing contracts, and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, Japanese yen and U.K. pound. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. Summary of Results Revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020 , revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Health & Public Service and Products and strong in Resources, Communications, Media & Technology and Financial Services. We experienced local currency revenue growth that was very strong in Growth Markets and strong in North America and Europe. Revenue growth in local currency was strong in both outsourcing and consulting during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 . While the business environment remained competitive, we experienced pricing improvement in some areas of our business. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . Consulting revenue growth in local currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was led by very strong growth in Health & Public Service and Products and strong growth in Communications, Media & Technology and Resources, while Financial Services was flat. Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. In our outsourcing business, revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was led by very strong growth in Financial Services and Resources and strong growth in Health & Public Service, Products and Communications, Media & Technology. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 , resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% lower than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2020 , we estimate that our full fiscal 2020 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 1% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. 23 Table of Contents Utilization for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 91%, down from 92% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 505,000 as of November 30, 2019 , compared to approximately 469,000 as of November 30, 2018 . The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 14% , down from 15% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 32.1% , compared with 31.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . The increase in gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 , compared with 15.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . For the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 15.6% , compared with 15.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . New Bookings New bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were $10.3 billion , with consulting bookings of $6.0 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.3 billion . 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended November 30, 2019 Compared to the Three Months Ended November 30, 2018 Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. Revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) were as follows: Three Months Ended Percent Increase U.S. Dollars Percent Increase Local Currency Percent of Revenues for the Three Months Ended November 30, 2019 November 30, 2018 November 30, 2019 November 30, 2018 (in millions of U.S. dollars) OPERATING GROUPS Communications, Media & Technology $ 2,245 $ 2,135 5 % 7 % 20 % 20 % Financial Services 2,190 2,120 3 6 19 20 Health & Public Service 1,969 1,754 12 13 18 16 Products 3,217 2,929 10 12 28 28 Resources 1,734 1,652 5 7 15 16 Other 5 16 n/m n/m — — TOTAL REVENUES $ 11,359 $ 10,606 7 % 9 % 100 % 100 % GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS (1) North America $ 5,288 $ 4,856 9 % 9 % 47 % 46 % Europe 3,790 3,714 2 7 33 35 Growth Markets 2,281 2,035 12 13 20 19 TOTAL REVENUES $ 11,359 $ 10,606 7 % 9 % 100 % 100 % TYPE OF WORK Consulting $ 6,377 $ 5,967 7 % 9 % 56 % 56 % Outsourcing 4,982 4,638 7 9 44 44 TOTAL REVENUES $ 11,359 $ 10,606 7 % 9 % 100 % 100 % _______________ n/m = not meaningful Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) Effective September 1, 2019 we revised the reporting of our geographic regions for the movement of one country from Growth Markets to Europe. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019 : Operating Groups • Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 7% in local currency, driven by growth in Software & Platforms across all geographic regions and Communications & Media in Europe, partially offset by a decline in High Tech in North America. • Financial Services revenues increased 6% in local currency, driven by growth in Insurance across all geographic regions and Banking & Capital Markets in Growth Markets and North America. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets in Europe. • Health & Public Service revenues increased 13% in local currency, led by Public Service and Health in North America. • Products revenues increased 12% in local currency, driven by growth in Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services and Life Sciences across all geographic regions, led by North America. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Industrial in North America. • Resources revenues increased 7% in local currency, driven by growth in Energy and Utilities across all geographic regions and Chemicals & Natural Resources in Europe and Growth Markets. These increases were partially offset by a decline in Chemicals & Natural Resources in North America. 25 Table of Contents Geographic Regions • North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by Italy, Germany, France and Ireland. • Growth Markets revenues increased 13% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as Brazil and Singapore. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $615 million , or 7% , over the first quarter of fiscal 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.4% from 84.6% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $403 million , or 6% , over the first quarter of fiscal 2019 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 67.9% from 68.9% during this period. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased to 32.1% from 31.1% during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $121 million , or 11% , over the first quarter of fiscal 2019 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.5% from 10.1% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $91 million , or 15% , over the first quarter of fiscal 2019 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.1% from 5.6% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased $138 million , or 8% , over the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Three Months Ended November 30, 2019 November 30, 2018 Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology $ 391 17 % $ 387 18 % $ 4 Financial Services 316 14 361 17 (45 ) Health & Public Service 252 13 197 11 55 Products 522 16 438 15 84 Resources 286 16 246 15 40 TOTAL $ 1,767 15.6 % $ 1,629 15.4 % $ 138 26 Table of Contents We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was similar to that disclosed for revenue. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2019 : • Communications, Media & Technology operating income was flat year-over-year as revenue growth was partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Financial Services operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues. • Health & Public Service operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability. • Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability. • Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher outsourcing contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020 , other income (expense) increased $45 million over the first quarter of fiscal 2019 , primarily due to gains on investments, partially offset by foreign exchange losses. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 23.6% , compared with 19.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended November 30, 2019 was primarily due to lower benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes and the phased-in effects of US tax reform. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2020 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5% . The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $2.09 for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 , compared with $1.96 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . The $0.13 increase in our diluted earnings per share was due to an increase of $0.17 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.06 from higher non-operating income, and $0.01 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.11 from a higher effective tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 27 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of November 30, 2019 , Cash and cash equivalents was $5.8 billion , compared with $6.1 billion as of August 31, 2019 . Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Three Months Ended November 30, 2019 November 30, 2018 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 787 $ 1,028 $ (241 ) Investing activities (166 ) (273 ) 107 Financing activities (948 ) (1,462 ) 514 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 11 10 1 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (316 ) $ (698 ) $ 381 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $241 million year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow was due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a change in timing of certain compensation payments, partially offset by higher net income. Investing activities: The $107 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower spending on business acquisitions and investments and increased proceeds from investments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $514 million decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in cash dividends paid due to a change in the frequency of payments from semi-annually to quarterly. For additional information, see Note 8 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of November 30, 2019 , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities (in millions of U.S. dollars) Syndicated loan facility $ 1,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 803 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 217 — Total $ 2,020 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $414 million of letters of credit outstanding as of November 30, 2019 . 28 Table of Contents Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the three months ended November 30, 2019 was as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Open-market share purchases (1) 3,293,069 $ 626 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 23,715 5 Other purchases (2) 528,311 99 — — Total 3,821,380 $ 725 23,715 $ 5 _______________ (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the three months ended November 30, 2019 , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2020 . The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 11 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 7 (Leases) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 7 includes updates to our leases policy as a result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2016-02.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting While we updated certain internal controls and supporting processes related to leases in connection with our adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-02 (Topic 842), there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 30 Table of Contents PART II — OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.

The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date. (3) As of November 30, 2019 , our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $3,044 million , which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs.

amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 24, 2018 . The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 . On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders. Allowances for Client Receivables As of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , total allowances recorded for client receivables were $ 49,216 and $ 49,913 , respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense was $ 109,398 and $ 322,746 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 , respectively, and $ 101,814 and $ 315,410 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 , respectively. As of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , total accumulated depreciation was $ 2,074,736 and $ 1,862,098 , respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $ 67,225 and $ 204,313 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 , respectively, and $ 95,696 and $ 248,838 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 , respectively. See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 ( “Topic 606”) On September 1, 2018 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. Topic 606 has been applied to contracts that were not completed as of September 1, 2018 . Results for reporting periods beginning after September 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting. See Note 2 (Revenues) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, we are now presenting total revenues and no longer reporting revenues before reimbursements. Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change in presentation. As a result of this change, for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 , both total revenues and cost of services 11 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) decreased by $ 143,858 and $ 472,632 , respectively, for hardware/software resale previously included in reimbursements. This change had no impact on operating income. The impact of adopting the new standard was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary impacts included additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from client contracts, including judgments and changes in estimates. Upon adoption, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $ 6,451 , net of a tax impact of $ 3,071 , as of September 1, 2018 . The impact of adopting the new standard for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 was an increase to revenues of approximately $ 35.8 million and $ 54.5 million , respectively. The impact on our balance sheet as of May 31, 2019 was not material with the exception of the classification of $ 2.4 billion of receivables and $ 589.6 million of contract assets, which were previously classified as Unbilled services, net. FASB ASU No. 2016-16 On September 1, 2018 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Upon adoption, we recorded deferred tax assets and an increase in retained earnings of $ 2,144,427 , and we will recognize incremental income tax expense as these deferred tax assets are utilized. Our fiscal 2019 annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 3.3 % higher due to the adoption. The adoption had no impact on cash flows. The impact of adoption as of September 1, 2018 of FASB ASU No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) and No. 2016-16 (Topic 740) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: Balance as of August 31, 2018 Adjustments Due to ASU 2014-09 (Topic 606) Adjustments Due to ASU 2016-16 (Topic 740) Balance as of September 1, 2018 Balance Sheet CURRENT ASSETS Receivables from clients, net $ 4,996,454 $ 2,100,402 $ — $ 7,096,856 Unbilled services, net 2,499,914 ( 2,499,914 ) — — Contract assets — 547,809 — 547,809 Receivables and contract assets $ 7,496,368 $ 148,297 $ — $ 7,644,665 NON-CURRENT ASSETS Unbilled services, net $ 23,036 $ ( 23,036 ) $ — $ — Contract assets — 23,036 — 23,036 Deferred contract costs 705,124 ( 2,867 ) — 702,257 Deferred income taxes, net 2,086,807 3,071 2,144,427 4,234,305 CURRENT LIABILITIES Deferred revenues 2,837,682 154,952 — 2,992,634 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Retained earnings 7,952,413 ( 6,451 ) 2,144,427 10,090,389 FASB ASU No. 2017-07 On September 1, 2018 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance amends certain presentation and disclosure requirements for employers with defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans. The standard requires the service cost component of the net benefit cost to be in the same line item as other compensation in operating income and the other components of net benefit cost to be presented outside of operating income on a retrospective basis. Upon adoption, we reclassified $ 15 million and $ 41 million for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 , respectively and $ 58 million for fiscal 2018 of operating expenses to non-operating expense to conform with the fiscal 2019 treatment of these expenses. 12 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) FASB ASU No. 2016-01 On September 1, 2018 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires investments previously accounted for under the cost method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions. We adopted this standard using the prospective method. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting Pronouncement The following standard, issued by the FASB, will result in a change in practice and will have a financial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements: Standard Description Accenture Adoption Date Impact on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters 2016-02 : Leases and related updates (Topic 842) The ASU amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The guidance allows either a modified retrospective or an effective date transition method. September 1, 2019 While we are continuing to assess the potential impact of this ASU, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office space operating leases. We anticipate this ASU will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but will not have a material impact on our other Consolidated Financial Statements or footnotes. We will adopt the standard using the effective date method. 2. REVENUES We account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on September 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service based on margins for similar services sold on a standalone basis. While determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligations require judgment, generally relative standalone selling prices and the separate performance obligations are readily identifiable as we sell those performance obligations unaccompanied by other performance obligations. Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration. If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately. If the modified services are not distinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Our revenues are derived from contracts for outsourcing services, technology integration consulting services and non-technology consulting services. These contracts have different terms based on the scope, performance obligations and complexity of the engagement, which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, fee-per-transaction contracts and contracts with multiple fee types. The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that 13 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. These variable amounts generally are awarded or refunded upon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metrics, milestones or cost targets and can be based upon client discretion. We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur. These estimates reflect the expected value of the variable fee and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. The majority of our revenues are recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligations. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the services to be provided. Outsourcing Contracts Our outsourcing contracts typically span several years. Revenues are generally recognized on outsourcing contracts over time because our clients benefit from the services as they are performed. Outsourcing contracts require us to provide a series of distinct services each period over the contract term. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms. Technology Integration Consulting Services Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design/redesign, build and implement new or enhanced systems and related processes for our clients are recognized over time as control of the system is transferred continuously to the client. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Generally, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. Non-Technology Integration Consulting Services Our contracts for non-technology integration consulting services are typically less than a year in duration. Revenues are generally recognized over time as our clients benefit from the services as they are performed, or the contract includes termination provisions enabling payment for performance completed to date. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g. time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are generally recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. For non-technology integration consulting contracts which do not qualify to recognize revenue over time, we recognize revenues at a point in time when we satisfy our performance obligations and the client obtains control of the promised good or service. Remaining Performance Obligations On May 31, 2019 , we had approximately $ 18 billion of remaining performance obligations. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 39 % of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in fiscal 2019 , an additional 37 % in fiscal 2020 , and the balance thereafter. See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. 14 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Contract Estimates Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored over the life of our contracts, and recorded revenues and cost estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a technology integration consulting contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods increased our revenues by approximately $ 16 million and decreased our revenues by approximately $ 13 million for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 , respectively . No adjustment on any one contract was material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 . Contract Balances The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in Receivables, Contract assets, and Deferred revenues (Contract liabilities) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Our receivables are rights to consideration that are conditional only upon the passage of time as compared to our contract assets, which are rights to consideration conditional upon additional factors. When we bill or receive payments from our clients before revenue is recognized, we record Contract liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. For some outsourcing contracts, we receive payments for transition or set-up activities, which are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are provided. These advance payments are typically not a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to complete its obligations under the contract. Deferred transition revenues were $ 570,310 and $ 581,395 as of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $ 685,605 and $ 690,868 as of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables, Contract assets and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): May 31, 2019 As of September 1, 2018 (as adjusted) Receivables, net of allowance $ 7,544,573 $ 7,096,856 Contract assets (current) 589,574 547,809 Receivables and contract assets (current) 8,134,147 7,644,665 Contract assets (non-current) 19,739 23,036 Deferred revenues (current) 3,255,784 2,992,634 Deferred revenues (non-current) 571,769 618,124 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of February 28, 2019 and September 1, 2018 were $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.7 billion , respectively. 15 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 3.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 , as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $ 10,319 and $ 88,247 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 , respectively, and net losses of $ 84,480 and $ 37,698 for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 , respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. 19 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: May 31, 2019 August 31, 2018 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 65,691 $ 29,380 Other non-current assets 57,006 1,065 Other Derivatives Other current assets 23,206 28,700 Total assets $ 145,903 $ 59,145 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 9,847 $ 50,870 Other non-current liabilities 4,969 64,365 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 8,185 25,455 Total liabilities $ 23,001 $ 140,690 Total fair value $ 122,902 $ ( 81,545 ) Total notional value $ 8,923,252 $ 8,783,014 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows: May 31, 2019 August 31, 2018 Net derivative assets $ 131,648 $ 23,599 Net derivative liabilities 8,746 105,144 Total fair value $ 122,902 $ ( 81,545 ) Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We record these investments at cost and remeasure them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $ 125,724 as of May 31, 2019 . Prior to the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-01, these investments were accounted for under the cost method. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 9. INCOME TAXES On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7 % for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized tax expense of $ 136,724 , primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded additional tax expense of $ 40,927 resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act. Our analysis and accounting for the Tax Act is complete. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 were 25.6 % and 34.4 % , respectively. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 and 2018 were 21.1 % and 27.2 % , respectively. Excluding tax expense associated with the enactment of the Tax Act and $ 80,847 of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change, the effective tax rates would have been 26.8 % and 21.3 % for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2019 was lower primarily due to changes in prior year tax liabilities and the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was lower primarily due to higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes, changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16 and lower tax benefits from share-based payments. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our SinnerSchrader AG subsidiary. As of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , we have reflected the fair value of approximately $ 41,000 and $ 47,000 , respectively, related to redeemable common stock of the subsidiary in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of May 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $ 702,000 and $ 782,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $ 130,000 and $ 130,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of May 31, 2019 , we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 21 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 11.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 , and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 . We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “ fiscal 2019 ” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019 . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to: • Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 23 Table of Contents • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. • We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. • Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 . Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 24 Table of Contents Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, U.K. pound and Japanese yen. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In connection with the adoption, we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements (net revenues). This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Summary of Results Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . Revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Resources, strong in Products, Communication, Media & Technology and Health & Public Service, and solid in Financial Services. We experienced very strong growth in Growth Markets, strong growth in North America and solid growth in Europe. Revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and strong in consulting during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 . While the business environment remained competitive, we experienced pricing improvement in several areas of our business. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . Consulting revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . Consulting revenue growth in local currency in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in Resources, strong growth in Health & Public Service and Products and modest growth in Communications, Media & Technology and Financial Services . Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. In our outsourcing business, revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . Outsourcing revenues for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in Resources, Products and Communications, Media & Technology, strong growth in Financial Services and solid growth in Health & Public Service. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 , resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 5% and 4% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent 25 Table of Contents ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019 , we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 91% , consistent with the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 482,000 as of May 31, 2019 , compared to approximately 449,000 as of May 31, 2018 . The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 18% , up from 17% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which required us to reclassify certain components of pension costs from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 31.8% , compared with 31.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was 30.7% compared with 30.4% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . The increase in gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 16.0% for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , compared with 15.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 15.8% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018 , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues increased 40 basis points , primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points. For the nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018 , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues were flat , and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points. Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 15.5% , compared with 15.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . Operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was 14.7% , compared with 14.5% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740). Upon adoption, we recorded deferred tax assets of $2.1 billion, and we will recognize incremental income tax expense going forward as these deferred tax assets are utilized. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 26 Table of Contents The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2019 were 25.6% and 21.1% , respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 were 34.4% and 27.2% , respectively. For the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded a tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $41 million and $178 million, respectively. Absent these charges and $81 million of expense from a non-U.S. tax law change recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 26.8% and 21.3%, respectively. For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. Diluted earnings per share were $1.93 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , compared with $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . Diluted earnings per share were $5.62 for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , compared with $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . The impact of tax law changes decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.19 and $0.40 during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018, respectively. Excluding the impact of these changes, diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been $1.79 and $5.16, respectively. We have presented effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impacts of the tax law changes in fiscal 2018 , as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these changes and our financial performance. New Bookings New bookings for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were $10.6 billion , with consulting bookings of $6.0 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.6 billion . New bookings for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 were $32.6 billion , with consulting bookings of $18.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $13.9 billion . 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended May 31, 2019 Compared to the Three Months Ended May 31, 2018 Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources.

Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. In addition, we updated operating group results for fiscal 2018 to include an acquisition previously categorized within Other. Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 : Operating Groups • Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 7% in local currency, driven by growth in Software & Platforms across all geographic regions, led by North America. • Financial Services revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by growth in Insurance across all geographic regions and Banking & Capital Markets in Growth Markets, partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets in Europe. • Health & Public Service revenues increased 6% in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service in North America and Europe and Health in North America, partially offset by a decline in Public Service in Growth Markets. • Products revenues increased 8% in local currency, driven by growth in Life Sciences across all geographic regions and Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services in Europe and Growth Markets. • Resources revenues increased 19% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions. 28 Table of Contents Geographic Regions • North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 5% in local currency, led by Italy, the United Kingdom and Ireland. • Growth Markets revenues increased 13% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as China, Brazil and Australia. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $322 million , or 4% , over the third quarter of fiscal 2018 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 84.5% from 84.7% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $208 million , or 3% , over the third quarter of fiscal 2018 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 68.2% from 68.8% during this period. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased to 31.8% from 31.2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $78 million , or 7% , over the third quarter of fiscal 2018 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.7% from 10.3% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher selling and other business development costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $36 million , or 6% , over the third quarter of fiscal 2018 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 5.6% from 5.5% during this period. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $83 million , or 5% , over the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Three Months Ended May 31, 2019 May 31, 2018 (1) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology $ 425 19 % $ 386 18 % $ 39 Financial Services 347 16 386 17 (39 ) Health & Public Service 196 11 219 12 (23 ) Products 459 15 456 15 3 Resources 291 17 187 12 103 TOTAL $ 1,718 15.5 % $ 1,635 15.3 % $ 83 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Certain components of pension service costs were reclassified from Operating expenses to Non-operating expenses. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 29 Table of Contents We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was similar to that disclosed for revenue. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018 : • Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability. • Financial Services operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Health & Public Service operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower consulting contract profitability. • Products operating income was relatively flat year-over-year as revenue growth was offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 25.6% , compared with 34.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . In the third quarter of fiscal 2018 , we recorded a $122 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, the effective tax rate would have been 26.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to changes in prior year tax liabilities and the geographic distribution of earnings, partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $1.93 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , compared with $1.60 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 . The $0.33 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.19 . Excluding the impact of these changes, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.14 compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018 due to an increase of $0.09 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.03 from a lower effective tax rate, $0.02 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from lower non-operating expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.01 from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interests-other. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended May 31, 2019 Compared to the Nine Months Ended May 31, 2018 Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources.

Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. In addition, we updated operating group results for fiscal 2018 to include an acquisition previously categorized within Other. Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2018 : Operating Groups • Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 11% in local currency, driven by growth in Software & Platforms across all geographic regions, led by North America. • Financial Services revenues increased 2% in local currency, driven by growth in Insurance across all geographic regions and Banking & Capital Markets in Growth Markets, partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets in Europe. • Health & Public Service revenues increased 5% in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service in Europe and North America. • Products revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services in Europe and Growth Markets, and Industrial in Europe. • Resources revenues increased 21% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions. 31 Table of Contents Geographic Regions • North America revenues increased 9% in local currency, driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 6% in local currency, led by Italy, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and France. • Growth Markets revenues increased 15% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as Brazil and China. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $1,366 million , or 5% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2018 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.3% from 85.5% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $1,046 million , or 5% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2018 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.3% from 69.6% during this period. Gross margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased to 30.7% from 30.4% during the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower non-payroll and labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $168 million , or 5% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2018 , and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 10.2% during this period. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $152 million , or 9% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2018 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 5.8% from 5.6% during this period. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $304 million , or 7% , over the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Nine Months Ended May 31, 2019 May 31, 2018 (1) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology $ 1,180 18 % $ 1,001 16 % $ 179 Financial Services 977 15 1,069 17 (92 ) Health & Public Service 539 10 602 12 (63 ) Products 1,272 14 1,247 15 25 Resources 765 15 509 12 256 TOTAL $ 4,734 14.7 % $ 4,429 14.5 % $ 304 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Certain components of pension service costs were reclassified from Operating expenses to Non-operating expenses. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 32 Table of Contents We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was similar to that disclosed for revenue. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2018 : • Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. • Financial Services operating income decreased as higher consulting contract profitability and revenue growth were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Health & Public Service operating income decreased as revenue growth was offset by lower consulting contract profitability. • Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was 21.1% , compared with 27.2% for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . In the nine months ended May 31, 2018 , we recorded a $258 million charge associated with tax law changes. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 would have been 21.3% . The lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was primarily due to higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes, changes in the geographic distribution of earnings and adjustments to prior year tax liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16 and lower tax benefits from share-based payments. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2019 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5% . The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 decreased $84 million , or 62% , from the nine months ended May 31, 2018 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage in March 2018 from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $5.62 for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , compared with $4.76 for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 . The $0.86 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of tax law changes, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2018 by $0.40 . Excluding the impact of these changes, diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended May 31, 2019 increased $0.46 compared with the nine months ended May 31, 2018 , due to an increase of $0.37 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.05 from lower weighted average shares outstanding, $0.04 from lower non-operating expense and $0.01 from a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.01 from higher net income attributable to non-controlling interests-other . For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of May 31, 2019 , Cash and cash equivalents was $4.8 billion , compared with $5.1 billion as of August 31, 2018 . Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Nine Months Ended May 31, 2019 May 31, 2018 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,511 $ 3,917 $ 593 Investing activities (1,380 ) (875 ) (505 ) Financing activities (3,416 ) (3,177 ) (239 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (7 ) (63 ) 56 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (292 ) $ (198 ) $ (94 ) _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $593 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in accounts payable. Investing activities: The $505 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments, partially offset by lower spending on property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $239 million increase in cash used was primarily due to increases in the net purchases of shares and cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of May 31, 2019 , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities (in millions of U.S. dollars) Syndicated loan facility $ 1,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 815 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 220 — Total $ 2,035 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $405 million of letters of credit outstanding as of May 31, 2019 . 34 Table of Contents Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the nine months ended May 31, 2019 was as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Open-market share purchases (1) 11,637,946 $ 1,866 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 100,540 16 Other purchases (2) 2,678,537 402 — — Total 14,316,483 $ 2,268 100,540 $ 16 _______________ (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2019 . The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” New Accounting Pronouncements and Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 2 includes updates to our revenue policy as a result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2014-09 . ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK During the nine months ended May 31, 2019 , there were no material changes to the information on market risk exposure disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 . For a discussion of our market risk associated with foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk as of August 31, 2018 , see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 . 35 Table of Contents ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Accenture plc have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 36 Table of Contents PART II — OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.

(2) Since August 2001 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized and periodically confirmed a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , we purchased 2,652,552 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under this program for an aggregate price of $461 million . The open-market purchase program does not have an expiration date. (3) As of May 31, 2019 , our aggregate available authorization for share purchases and redemptions was $4,068 million , which management has the discretion to use for either our publicly announced open-market share purchase program or the other share purchase programs. Since August 2001 and as of May 31, 2019 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized an aggregate of $35,100 million for share purchases and redemptions by Accenture plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. (4) During the third quarter of fiscal 2019 , Accenture purchased 139,675 Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares in transactions unrelated to publicly announced share plans or programs. These transactions consisted of acquisitions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under our various employee equity share plans.

10 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Accenture plc and its controlled subsidiary companies have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for complete financial statements. We use the terms “Accenture,” “we” and “our” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 24, 2018 . The accompanying unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods. The results of operations for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 . On March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders. Allowances for Client Receivables As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , total allowances recorded for client receivables were $53,616 and $49,913 , respectively. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation expense was $110,635 and $213,348 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 , respectively, and $107,445 and $213,596 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 , respectively. As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , total accumulated depreciation was $2,027,164 and $1,862,098 , respectively. Deferred transition amortization expense was $68,209 and $137,088 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 , respectively, and $71,288 and $153,142 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 , respectively. See Note 6 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for intangible asset amortization balances. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09 ( “Topic 606”) On September 1, 2018 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. Topic 606 has been applied to contracts that were not completed as of September 1, 2018 . Results for reporting periods beginning after September 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting. See Note 2 (Revenues) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, we are now presenting total revenues and no longer reporting revenues before reimbursements. Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change in presentation. As a result of this change, for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 , both total revenues and cost of services 11 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) decreased by $158,594 and $328,774 , respectively, for hardware/software resale previously included in reimbursements. This change had no impact on operating income. The impact of adopting the new standard was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary impacts included additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from client contracts, including judgments and changes in estimates. Upon adoption, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $6,451 , net of a tax impact of $3,071 , as of September 1, 2018 . The impact of adopting the new standard for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 was an increase to revenues of approximately $6.9 million and $19.4 million , respectively. The impact on our balance sheet as of February 28, 2019 was not material with the exception of the classification of $2.2 billion of receivables and $571.8 million of contract assets, which were previously classified as Unbilled services, net. FASB ASU No. 2016-16 On September 1, 2018 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. Upon adoption, we recorded deferred tax assets and an increase in retained earnings of $2,144,427 , and we will recognize incremental income tax expense as these deferred tax assets are utilized. Our fiscal 2019 annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 3.3% higher due to the adoption. The adoption had no impact on cash flows. The impact of adoption as of September 1, 2018 of FASB ASU No. 2014-09 (Topic 606) and No. 2016-16 (Topic 740) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows: Balance as of August 31, 2018 Adjustments Due to ASU 2014-09 (Topic 606) Adjustments Due to ASU 2016-16 (Topic 740) Balance as of September 1, 2018 Balance Sheet CURRENT ASSETS Receivables from clients, net $ 4,996,454 $ 2,100,402 $ — $ 7,096,856 Unbilled services, net 2,499,914 (2,499,914 ) — — Contract assets — 547,809 — 547,809 Receivables and contract assets $ 7,496,368 $ 148,297 $ — $ 7,644,665 NON-CURRENT ASSETS Unbilled services, net $ 23,036 $ (23,036 ) $ — $ — Contract assets — 23,036 — 23,036 Deferred contract costs 705,124 (2,867 ) — 702,257 Deferred income taxes, net 2,086,807 3,071 2,144,427 4,234,305 CURRENT LIABILITIES Deferred revenues 2,837,682 154,952 — 2,992,634 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Retained earnings 7,952,413 (6,451 ) 2,144,427 10,090,389 FASB ASU No. 2017-07 On September 1, 2018 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The new guidance amends certain presentation and disclosure requirements for employers with defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans. The standard requires the service cost component of the net benefit cost to be in the same line item as other compensation in operating income and the other components of net benefit cost to be presented outside of operating income on a retrospective basis. Upon adoption, we reclassified $13 million and $26 million for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively and $58 million for fiscal 2018 of operating expenses to non-operating expense to conform with the fiscal 2019 treatment of these expenses. 12 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) FASB ASU No. 2016-01 On September 1, 2018 , we adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The standard requires investments previously accounted for under the cost method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values will be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions. We adopted this standard using the prospective method. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting Pronouncement The following standard, issued by the FASB, will result in a change in practice and will have a financial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements: Standard Description Accenture Adoption Date Impact on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters 2016-02 : Leases and related updates (Topic 842) The guidance amends existing guidance to require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The guidance requires either a modified retrospective transition method or a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. September 1, 2019 While we are continuing to assess the potential impact of this ASU, we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office space operating leases. We anticipate this ASU will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets but will not have a material impact on our other Consolidated Financial Statements or footnotes. We will apply the cumulative effect method. 2. REVENUES We account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on September 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in Topic 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service based on margins for similar services sold on a standalone basis. While determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligations require judgment, generally relative standalone selling prices and the separate performance obligations are readily identifiable as we sell those performance obligations unaccompanied by other performance obligations. Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration. If a contract modification results in the addition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from the services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately. If the modified services are not distinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract. Our revenues are derived from contracts for outsourcing services, technology integration consulting services and non-technology consulting services. These contracts have different terms based on the scope, performance obligations and complexity of the engagement, which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, fee-per-transaction contracts and contracts with multiple fee types. 13 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. These variable amounts generally are awarded or refunded upon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metrics, milestones or cost targets and can be based upon client discretion. We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur. These estimates reflect the expected value of the variable fee and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information available at the time. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. The majority of our revenues are recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligations. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the services to be provided. Outsourcing Contracts Our outsourcing contracts typically span several years. Revenues are generally recognized on outsourcing contracts over time because our clients benefit from the services as they are performed. Outsourcing contracts require us to provide a series of distinct services each period over the contract term. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms. Technology Integration Consulting Services Revenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design/redesign, build and implement new or enhanced systems and related processes for our clients are recognized over time as control of the system is transferred continuously to the client. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. Generally, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. Non-Technology Integration Consulting Services Our contracts for non-technology integration consulting services are typically less than a year in duration. Revenues are generally recognized over time as our clients benefit from the services as they are performed, or the contract includes termination provisions enabling payment for performance completed to date. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided to the client (e.g. time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are generally recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the client. For non-technology integration consulting contracts which do not qualify to recognize revenue over time, we recognize revenues at a point in time when we satisfy our performance obligations and the client obtains control of the promised good or service. Remaining Performance Obligations On February 28, 2019 , we had approximately $19 billion of remaining performance obligations. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately 57% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in fiscal 2019 , an additional 24% in fiscal 2020 , and the balance thereafter. See Note 11 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for our disaggregated revenues. 14 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Contract Estimates Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored over the life of our contracts, and recorded revenues and cost estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on a technology integration consulting contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods increased our revenues by approximately $37 million and $38 million for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 , respectively . No adjustment on any one contract was material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 . Contract Balances The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in Receivables, Contract assets, and Deferred revenues (Contract liabilities) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Our receivables are rights to consideration that are conditional only upon the passage of time as compared to our contract assets, which are rights to consideration conditional upon additional factors. When we bill or receive payments from our clients before revenue is recognized, we record Contract liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. For some outsourcing contracts, we receive payments for transition or set-up activities, which are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are provided. These advance payments are typically not a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to complete its obligations under the contract. Deferred transition revenues were $587,356 and $581,395 as of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. Deferred transition costs were $702,404 and $690,868 as of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables, Contract assets and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues): February 28, 2019 As of September 1, 2018 (as adjusted) Receivables, net of allowance $ 7,579,589 $ 7,096,856 Contract assets (current) 571,822 547,809 Receivables and contract assets (current) 8,151,411 7,644,665 Contract assets (non-current) 20,691 23,036 Deferred revenues (current) 3,335,751 2,992,634 Deferred revenues (non-current) 607,038 618,124 Changes in the contract asset and liability balances during the six months ended February 28, 2019 , were a result of normal business activity and not materially impacted by any other factors. Revenues recognized during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 that were included in Deferred revenues as of November 30, 2018 and September 1, 2018 were $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion , respectively. 15 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 3.

Exchangeable Shares Total Cash Outlay Dividend Payment Date Record Date Cash Outlay Record Date Cash Outlay November 15, 2018 $ 1.46 October 18, 2018 $ 931,460 October 16, 2018 $ 1,378 $ 932,838 The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. Subsequent Event On March 26, 2019 , the Board of Directors of Accenture plc declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.46 per share on its Class A ordinary shares for shareholders of record at the close of business on April 11, 2019 payable on May 15, 2019 . The payment of the cash dividend will result in the issuance of an immaterial number of additional restricted share units to holders of restricted share units. 8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivatives In the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Cash Flow Hedges For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. For information related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018 , as well as those expected to be reclassified into Cost of services in the next 12 months, see Note 4 (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Derivatives Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of foreign currency forward contracts that have not been designated as hedges were net losses of $28,945 and $77,928 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 , respectively, and net gains of $56,316 and $46,783 for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 , respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items. 19 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) Fair Value of Derivative Instruments The notional and fair values of all derivative instruments were as follows: February 28, 2019 August 31, 2018 Assets Cash Flow Hedges Other current assets $ 28,802 $ 29,380 Other non-current assets 13,474 1,065 Other Derivatives Other current assets 14,319 28,700 Total assets $ 56,595 $ 59,145 Liabilities Cash Flow Hedges Other accrued liabilities $ 28,764 $ 50,870 Other non-current liabilities 27,766 64,365 Other Derivatives Other accrued liabilities 13,908 25,455 Total liabilities $ 70,438 $ 140,690 Total fair value $ (13,843 ) $ (81,545 ) Total notional value $ 8,830,792 $ 8,783,014 We utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency transaction obligations and for the set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the transaction. In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value. The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements was as follows: February 28, 2019 August 31, 2018 Net derivative assets $ 32,656 $ 23,599 Net derivative liabilities 46,499 105,144 Total fair value $ (13,843 ) $ (81,545 ) Equity Securities Without Readily Determinable Fair Values We hold investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We record these investments at cost and remeasure them to fair value based on certain observable price changes or impairment events as they occur. The carrying amount of these investments was $117,728 as of February 28, 2019 . Prior to the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-01, these investments were accounted for under the cost method. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 9. INCOME TAXES On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% , effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. In the three months ended February 28, 2018, we recognized tax expense of $136,742 , primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets at the new, lower rates. In the three months ended May 31, 2018, we recorded additional tax expense of $40,927 resulting from our continued analysis of the Tax Act. Our analysis and accounting for the Tax Act is complete. We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2019 and February 28, 2018 were 17.1% and 26.1% , respectively. Our effective tax rates for the six months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018 were 18.6% and 23.0% , respectively. Excluding tax expense associated with the enactment of the Tax Act, the effective tax rates would have been 15.1% and 18.0% for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2019 was higher primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments and higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16, partially offset by a decrease in prior year tax liabilities. The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was higher primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments and higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16, partially offset by higher final determinations of prior year taxes. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to these Consolidated Financial Statements. 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We have either the right to purchase at fair value or, if certain events occur, may be required to purchase at fair value outstanding shares of our SinnerSchrader AG subsidiary. As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , we have reflected the fair value of approximately $43,000 and $47,000 , respectively, related to redeemable common stock of the subsidiary in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Indemnifications and Guarantees In the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. As of February 28, 2019 and August 31, 2018 , our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the performance of third parties was approximately $685,000 and $782,000 , respectively, of which all but approximately $141,000 and $130,000 , respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the indemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified limitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the maximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We have assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty obligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as a whole. Legal Contingencies As of February 28, 2019 , we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters. We and/or our personnel also from time to time are involved in investigations by various regulatory or legal authorities concerning matters arising in the course of our business around the world. Based on the present status of these matters, management believes the range of reasonably possible losses in addition to amounts accrued, net of insurance recoveries, will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 21 Table of Contents ACCENTURE PLC NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued) (In thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed) (Unaudited) 11.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 , and with the information under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 . We use the terms “Accenture,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this report to refer to Accenture plc and its subsidiaries. All references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference to “ fiscal 2019 ” means the 12-month period that will end on August 31, 2019 . All references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. We use the term “in local currency” so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results “in local currency” are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) relating to our operations, results of operations and other matters that are based on our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections. Words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” “positioned,” “outlook” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties and other factors that might cause such differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to: • Our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients’ businesses and levels of business activity. • Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations. • If we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. • We could face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Accenture data from security breaches or cyberattacks. • The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. • Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. • Our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our services and solutions, if we are unable to remain competitive, if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiencies. • Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 23 Table of Contents • As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks. • Our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. • Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. • If we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. • If we do not successfully manage and develop our relationships with key alliance partners or if we fail to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, our results of operations could be adversely affected. • Our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. • We might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses. • If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or if our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected. • Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results. • Many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels. This could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins. • Our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. • We might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us. • We are incorporated in Ireland and a significant portion of our assets is located outside the United States. As a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States. We may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in Ireland. • Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and might afford less protection to shareholders. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 . Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 24 Table of Contents Overview Revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to our clients’ current needs and challenges. The level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading services and solutions and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. Our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. There continues to be significant volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in many markets around the world, which may impact our business. We continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. There also continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the Euro, U.K. pound and Japanese yen. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our financial results. As previously announced, on January 10, 2019, Pierre Nanterme stepped down as our chairman and chief executive officer and as a director for health reasons. Effective January 10, 2019, the Board of Directors appointed David Rowland, who was serving as our chief financial officer, as the interim chief executive officer and a director of Accenture, and KC McClure, who was serving as our managing director—Finance Operations, as our chief financial officer, and named our lead independent director, Marge Magner, as the non-executive chair of the board. We subsequently announced the passing of Mr. Nanterme on January 31, 2019. Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In connection with the adoption, we present total revenues and no longer report revenues before reimbursements (net revenues). This change has no impact on operating income but does affect ratios calculated as a percentage of revenue, such as operating margin. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Summary of Results Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . Revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2018 . Demand for our services and solutions continued to be strong, resulting in growth across all areas of our business. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019 , revenue growth in local currency was very strong in Resources, Communication, Media & Technology and Products, and modest in Health & Public Service and Financial Services. We experienced very strong growth in Growth Markets and strong growth in North America and Europe. Revenue growth in local currency was strong in consulting and outsourcing during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 . While the business environment remained competitive, we experienced pricing improvement in several areas of our business. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. In our consulting business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . Consulting revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased 7% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2018 . Consulting revenue growth in local currency in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in Resources, strong growth in Products, Communications, Media & Technology and Health & Public Service and slight growth in Financial Services . Our consulting revenue growth continues to be driven by strong demand for digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition, clients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. In our outsourcing business, revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 5% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . Outsourcing revenues for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency compared to the six months ended February 28, 2018 . Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was led by very strong growth in Communications, Media & Technology, Resources and Products, and modest growth in Financial Services, while Health & Public Service had a slight decline. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and cost efficiency. As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in 25 Table of Contents favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 compared to the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 , resulting in unfavorable currency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 4% and 3% lower, respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for the remainder of fiscal 2019 , we estimate that our full fiscal 2019 revenue growth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 3% lower in U.S. dollars than our revenue growth in local currency. The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs. Utilization for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 91% , consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to approximately 477,000 as of February 28, 2019 , compared to approximately 442,000 as of February 28, 2018 . The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 15% , up from 13% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715), which required us to reclassify certain components of pension costs from operating expenses to non-operating expenses. Prior period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Gross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 29.2% , compared with 28.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was 30.2% compared with 29.9% for the six months ended February 28, 2018 . The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower labor costs, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs, compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 15.8% for the six months ended February 28, 2019 , compared with 15.8% for both the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and six months ended February 28, 2018 . We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018 , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 30 basis points , primarily due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the recognition of share-based compensation upon the previously disclosed vesting and settlement of our former chairman and chief executive officer’s restricted share units in connection with his resignation for health reasons during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. For the six months ended February 28, 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018 , Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points, and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points. 26 Table of Contents Operating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 13.3% , compared with 13.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . Operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was 14.3% , compared with 14.1% for the six months ended February 28, 2018 . Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740). Upon adoption, we recorded deferred tax assets of $2.1 billion, and we will recognize incremental income tax expense going forward as these deferred tax assets are utilized. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2019 were 17.1% and 18.6% , respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 were 26.1% and 23.0% , respectively. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a $137 million tax charge associated with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Absent this charge, our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 15.1% and 18.0%, respectively. For additional information see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. Diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 , compared with $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . Diluted earnings per share were $3.69 for the six months ended February 28, 2019 , compared with $3.16 for the six months ended February 28, 2018 . The tax charge decreased fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share by $0.21 in both the second quarter and six months ended February 28, 2018. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.58 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and $3.37 for the six months ended February 28, 2018. We have presented effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of the tax charge in fiscal 2018 , as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to both the impact of the charge and our financial performance. New Bookings New bookings for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were $11.8 billion , with consulting bookings of $6.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $5.1 billion . New bookings for the six months ended February 28, 2019 were $22.0 billion , with consulting bookings of $12.6 billion and outsourcing bookings of $9.3 billion . 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended February 28, 2019 Compared to the Three Months Ended February 28, 2018 Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources.

Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. In addition, we updated operating group results for fiscal 2018 to include an acquisition previously categorized within Other. Revenues The following revenues commentary discusses local currency revenue changes for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 : Operating Groups • Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 12% in local currency, driven by growth in Software & Platforms across all geographic regions, led by North America. • Financial Services revenues increased 2% in local currency, driven by growth in Insurance across all geographic regions and Banking & Capital Markets in Growth Markets, partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets in Europe. • Health & Public Service revenues increased 3% in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service in Europe and Growth Markets. • Products revenues increased 10% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions, led by Consumer Goods, Retail & Travel Services in Europe and Growth Markets, and Industrial in Europe. • Resources revenues increased 22% in local currency, driven by growth across all industry groups and geographic regions. 28 Table of Contents Geographic Regions • North America revenues increased 8% in local currency, driven by the United States. • Europe revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by Italy, the United Kingdom, France and Ireland. • Growth Markets revenues increased 16% in local currency, driven by Japan, as well as Brazil, China and Singapore. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $454 million , or 5% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2018 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 86.7% from 86.9% during this period. Cost of Services Cost of services for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $350 million , or 5% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2018 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 70.8% from 71.1% during this period. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased to 29.2% from 28.9% during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 .The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $21 million , or 2% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2018 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.8% from 10.1% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to improved operational efficiency in our business development activities compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. General and Administrative Costs General and administrative costs for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $83 million , or 15% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2018 , and increased as a percentage of revenues to 6.2% from 5.7% during this period. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher share-based compensation as discussed in the Overview. Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $91 million , or 7% , over the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . Operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: Three Months Ended February 28, 2019 February 28, 2018 (1) Operating Income Operating Margin Operating Income Operating Margin Increase (Decrease) (in millions of U.S. dollars) Communications, Media & Technology $ 368 17 % $ 317 16 % $ 51 Financial Services 269 13 311 15 (42 ) Health & Public Service 146 9 158 9 (12 ) Products 375 13 378 14 (3 ) Resources 228 14 132 9 96 TOTAL $ 1,387 13.3 % $ 1,296 13.1 % $ 91 _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. (1) Effective September 1, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. Certain components of pension service costs were reclassified from Operating expenses to Non-operating expenses. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. 29 Table of Contents We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was similar to that disclosed for revenue. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we experienced higher share-based compensation as discussed in the Overview. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2018 : • Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. • Financial Services operating income decreased as higher consulting contract profitability and revenue growth were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Health & Public Service operating income decreased as revenue growth and higher outsourcing contract profitability were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Products operating income was relatively flat year-over-year as revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments in privately held companies. For the second quarter of fiscal 2019 , other expense decreased $33 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 , primarily due to lower net foreign exchange losses. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 17.1% , compared with 26.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . In the second quarter of fiscal 2018 , we recorded a $137 million tax charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 would have been 15.1% . The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2019 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments and higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16, partially offset by a decrease in prior year tax liabilities. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased $40 million , or 71% , from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $1.73 for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 , compared with $1.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 . The $0.36 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million tax charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 by $0.21 . Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 increased $0.15 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2018 , due to an increase of $0.12 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.05 from lower non-operating expense and $0.02 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.04 from a higher effective tax rate. For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended February 28, 2019 Compared to the Six Months Ended February 28, 2018 Our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources.

Cost of Services Cost of services for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased $838 million , or 6% , over the six months ended February 28, 2018 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 69.8% from 70.1% during this period. Gross margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased to 30.2% from 29.9% during the six months ended February 28, 2018 . The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower non-payroll costs compared to the same period in fiscal 2018. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased $90 million , or 5% , over the six months ended February 28, 2018 , and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 9.9% from 10.1% during this period.

In addition, during the six months ended February 28, 2019, we experienced higher share-based compensation as discussed in the Overview. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for the six months ended February 28, 2019 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2018 : • Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability. • Financial Services operating income decreased as higher contract profitability and revenue growth were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Health & Public Service operating income decreased as revenue growth and higher outsourcing contract profitability were offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Products operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. • Resources operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and higher consulting contract profitability. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was 18.6% , compared with 23.0% for the six months ended February 28, 2018 . In the second quarter of fiscal 2018 , we recorded a $137 million tax charge associated with the enactment of the Tax Act. Absent this charge, our effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2018 would have been 18.0% . The higher effective tax rate for the six months ended February 28, 2019 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments and higher expense from the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-16, partially offset by higher benefits from final determinations of prior year taxes. For additional information, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and subject to volatility year to year. We expect the fiscal 2019 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5% . The effective tax rate for interim periods can vary because of the timing of when certain events occur during the year. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the six months ended February 28, 2019 decreased $88 million , or 73% , from the six months ended February 28, 2018 due to the decrease in the non-controlling ownership percentage from 4% held by Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. to less than 1% held by only Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. driven by the Accenture Holdings plc merger with and into Accenture plc. For additional information on the merger, see Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements”. Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share were $3.69 for the six months ended February 28, 2019 , compared with $3.16 for the six months ended February 28, 2018 . The $0.53 increase in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $137 million tax charge associated with the Tax Act, which decreased diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2018 by $0.21 . Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for the six months ended February 28, 2019 increased $0.32 compared with the six months ended February 28, 2018 , due to an increase of $0.28 from higher revenues and operating results, $0.03 from lower non-operating expenses and $0.03 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.02 from a higher effective tax rate .For information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see Note 3 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” 33 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of February 28, 2019 , Cash and cash equivalents was $4.5 billion , compared with $5.1 billion as of August 31, 2018 . Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in our Consolidated Cash Flows Statements, are summarized in the following table: Six Months Ended February 28, 2019 February 28, 2018 Change (in millions of U.S. dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 2,387 $ 1,930 $ 457 Investing activities (725 ) (605 ) (120 ) Financing activities (2,294 ) (1,882 ) (412 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 35 25 10 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (596 ) $ (532 ) $ (65 ) _______________ Amounts in table may not total due to rounding. Operating activities: The $457 million year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in accounts payable. Investing activities: The $120 million increase in cash used was primarily due to higher spending on business acquisitions and investments, partially offset by lower spending on property and equipment. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Financing activities: The $412 million increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in the net purchases of shares as well as an increase in cash dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from share issuances. For additional information, see Note 7 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” We believe that our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied for the next twelve months and thereafter through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future financial market activities. Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier subsidiaries, have been sufficient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future. Borrowing Facilities As of February 28, 2019 , we had the following borrowing facilities, including the issuance of letters of credit, to support general working capital purposes: Facility Amount Borrowings Under Facilities (in millions of U.S. dollars) Syndicated loan facility $ 1,000 $ — Separate, uncommitted, unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities 828 — Local guaranteed and non-guaranteed lines of credit 224 — Total $ 2,052 $ — Under the borrowing facilities described above, we had an aggregate of $386 million of letters of credit outstanding as of February 28, 2019 . 34 Table of Contents Share Purchases and Redemptions The Board of Directors of Accenture plc has authorized funding for our publicly announced open-market share purchase program for acquiring Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and for purchases and redemptions of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares held by current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees. Our share purchase activity during the six months ended February 28, 2019 was as follows: Accenture plc Class A Ordinary Shares Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. Exchangeable Shares Shares Amount Shares Amount (in millions of U.S. dollars, except share amounts) Open-market share purchases (1) 8,985,394 $ 1,405 — $ — Other share purchase programs — — 84,700 14 Other purchases (2) 2,538,862 378 — — Total 11,524,256 $ 1,783 84,700 $ 14 _______________ (1) We conduct a publicly announced open-market share purchase program for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares. These shares are held as treasury shares by Accenture plc and may be utilized to provide for select employee benefits, such as equity awards to our employees. (2) During the six months ended February 28, 2019 , as authorized under our various employee equity share plans, we acquired Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares primarily via share withholding for payroll tax obligations due from employees and former employees in connection with the delivery of Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares under those plans. These purchases of shares in connection with employee share plans do not affect our aggregate available authorization for our publicly announced open-market share purchase and the other share purchase programs. We intend to continue to use a significant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during the remainder of fiscal 2019 . The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions of Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business and in conjunction with some client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients with respect to certain matters. To date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 10 (Commitments and Contingencies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” New Accounting Pronouncements and Significant Accounting Policies See Note 1 (Basis of Presentation) and Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 1, “Financial Statements.” Note 2 includes updates to our revenue policy as result of the implementation of FASB ASU No. 2014-09 . ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK During the six months ended February 28, 2019 , there were no material changes to the information on market risk exposure disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 . For a discussion of our market risk associated with foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk as of August 31, 2018 , see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 . 35 Table of Contents ITEM 4.
