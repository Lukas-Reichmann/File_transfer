Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented as year/year basis point changes. Revenue for Residential Connectivity & Platforms increased but was consistent with the prior year period when excluding the positive impact of foreign currency. Growth in residential connectivity revenue was driven by: international connectivity revenue due to an increase in broadband revenue and wireless revenue, reflecting higher sales of devices and wireless services, as well as the positive impact of foreign currency; domestic broadband revenue primarily due to higher average rates; and domestic wireless revenue primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines. The growth in residential connectivity revenue was partially offset by: a decrease in video revenue due to a decline in the number of video customers, partially offset by an increase in average rates and the positive impact of foreign currency; lower advertising revenue primarily due to a decline in domestic political advertising; and lower 3 other revenue primarily due to lower residential wireline voice revenue, driven by a decline in the number of customers. Adjusted EBITDA for Residential Connectivity & Platforms increased due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses, which includes the impact of foreign currency. Programming expenses were consistent with the prior year period, driven by the decline in the number of domestic video customers, offset by domestic contractual rate increases, an increase in programming expenses for international sports channels and the impact of foreign currency. Non-programming expenses decreased primarily due to lower spending on marketing and promotion, lower fees paid to third-party channels related to advertising sales and lower technical and support costs. These decreases were partially offset by increased direct product costs associated with our wireless service, from increases in device sales and the number of customers receiving our wireless service, and our broadband services and by the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 38.4% .

Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented as year/year basis point changes. Revenue for Business Services Connectivity increased due to an increase in revenue from small business customers, driven by higher average rates, and an increase in revenue from medium-sized and enterprise customers. Adjusted EBITDA for Business Services Connectivity increased due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in direct product costs, technical and support expenses and costs related to our sales force. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 57.5%. 4 Content & Experiences ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Content & Experiences Revenue Media $6,029 $6,005 0.4 % Studios 2,518 3,296 (23.6 %) Theme Parks 2,418 2,064 17.2 % Headquarters & Other 13 22 (39.5 %) Eliminations (419) (909) 53.8 % Total Content & Experiences Revenue $10,559 $10,477 0.8 % Content & Experiences Adjusted EBITDA Media $723 $679 6.5 % Studios 429 551 (22.2 %) Theme Parks 983 819 20.0 % Headquarters & Other (178) (199) 10.7 % Eliminations 17 (59) NM Total Content & Experiences Adjusted EBITDA $1,973 $1,791 10.2 % NM=comparison not meaningful. Revenue for Content & Experiences increased compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for Content & Experiences increased primarily due to growth in Theme Parks and moderating Peacock Adjusted EBITDA losses. Media ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Revenue Domestic Advertising $1,913 $2,089 (8.4 %) Domestic Distribution 2,591 2,497 3.8 % International Networks 1,019 872 16.9 % Other 506 547 (7.6 %) Total Revenue $6,029 $6,005 0.4 % Operating Expenses 5,306 5,326 (0.4 %) Adjusted EBITDA $723 $679 6.5 % Revenue for Media increased primarily due to higher international networks and domestic distribution revenue, partially offset by lower domestic advertising and other revenue. International networks revenue increased primarily reflecting an increase in revenue associated with the distribution of sports channels and the positive impact of foreign currency. Domestic distribution revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue at Peacock, driven by an increase in paid subscribers, partially offset by lower revenue at our networks. The decrease in domestic advertising revenue was primarily due to lower revenue at our networks, partially offset by an increase in revenue at Peacock. Adjusted EBITDA for Media increased due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses was due to lower marketing and promotion expenses. Programming and production costs were consistent, reflecting higher programming costs at Peacock and increased sports programming costs, offset by a decrease in content costs at our entertainment television networks. Media results in the third quarter include $830 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA 8 loss of $565 million related to Peacock, compared to $506 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA 8 loss of $614 million in the prior year period. 5 Studios ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Revenue Content Licensing $1,691 $2,267 (25.4 %) Theatrical 504 673 (25.1 %) Other 324 356 (9.0 %) Total Revenue $2,518 $3,296 (23.6 %) Operating Expenses 2,089 2,744 (23.9 %) Adjusted EBITDA $429 $551 (22.2 %) Revenue for Studios decreased primarily due to lower content licensing revenue and theatrical revenue. Content licensing revenue decreased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios, including the impacts of the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild work stoppages in the current year period. Theatrical revenue declined primarily due to higher revenue from theatrical releases in the prior year period, including Minions: The Rise of Gru and Jurassic World: Dominion , partially offset by the successful performance of Oppenheimer in the current year period. Adjusted EBITDA for Studios decreased due to lower revenue, which more than offset lower operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses primarily reflected lower programming and production expenses, mainly due to lower costs associated with lower content licensing sales, including the impacts of the work stoppages in the current year period. Theme Parks ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 Change Revenue $2,418 $2,064 17.2 % Operating Expenses 1,435 1,244 15.4 % Adjusted EBITDA $983 $819 20.0 % Revenue for Theme Parks increased driven by higher revenue at our international theme parks, which had COVID-19 related restrictions in the prior year period, and higher revenue at our domestic theme parks, including Universal Studios Hollywood due to the continued success of Super Nintendo World, partially offset by lower revenue at our theme park in Orlando which continued to be above comparable pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Adjusted EBITDA for Theme Parks increased, reflecting higher revenue, which more than offset higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher costs primarily associated with increased guest attendance. Headquarters & Other Content & Experiences Headquarters & Other includes overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives. Headquarters & Other Adjusted EBITDA loss in the third quarter was $178 million, compared to a loss of $199 million in the prior year period. Eliminations Amounts represent eliminations of transactions between our Content & Experiences segments, the most significant being content licensing between the Studios and Media segments, which are affected by the timing of recognition of content licenses. Revenue eliminations were $419 million, compared to $909 million in the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a benefit of $17 million, compared to a loss of $59 million in the prior year period. 6 Corporate, Other and Eliminations ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Corporate & Other Revenue $643 $601 7.0 % Operating Expenses 893 919 (2.9 %) Adjusted EBITDA ($249) ($318) 21.6 % Eliminations Revenue ($1,358) ($1,277) 6.3 % Operating Expenses (1,375) (1,303) 5.5 % Adjusted EBITDA $16 $26 36.5 % Corporate & Other Corporate & Other primarily includes overhead and personnel costs; certain Sky operations; Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture beginning in June 2022. Eliminations Amounts represent eliminations of transactions between Connectivity & Platforms, Content & Experiences and other businesses, the most significant being distribution of television network programming between the Media and Residential Connectivity & Platforms segments. Revenue eliminations were $1.4 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a benefit of $16 million compared to a benefit of $26 million in the prior year period. 7 Notes: 1 We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. See Table 5 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 2 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 3 All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. 4 We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 5 Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our presentation of segment operating results around our two primary businesses, Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. We have updated certain historical information as a result of these changes, including: (1) presentation of Cable Communications results in the Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments and (2) presentation of Sky's results across the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Entertainment segments, and Corporate & Other. 6 Constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. See Table 6 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 7 Customer metrics for 2022 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certain customers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. These changes in methodology were not material to any period presented. Previously reported total Sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of December 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets. 8 Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of profit or loss for our segments. From time to time, we may present Adjusted EBITDA for components of our reportable segments, such as Peacock. We believe these measures are useful to evaluate our financial results and provide a basis of comparison to others, although our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA for components are generally presented on a consistent basis with the respective segments and include direct revenue and operating costs and expenses attributed to the component operations. Numerical information is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. ### 8 Conference Call and Other Information Comcast Corporation will host a conference call with the financial community today, October 26, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).

To the extent material, this Exhibit also discloses the additional purposes, if any, for which our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings press release itself. Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our segments. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA for our segments is not a non-GAAP financial measure under rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures presenting the earnings generated by our ongoing operations that we believe is useful to investors in making meaningful comparisons to other companies, although these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies, and period-over-period comparisons. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. Acquisition-related intangible assets are recognized as a result of the application of Accounting Standards Codification Topic (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (such as customer relationships), and their amortization is significantly affected by the size and timing of our acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets not resulting from business combinations (such as software and acquired intellectual property rights used in our theme parks) is included in Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS. Investments that investors may want to evaluate separately include all equity securities accounted for under ASC Topic 321, Investments-Equity Securities , as well as certain investments accounted for under ASC 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Exhibit 99.2 - Explanation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures, cont’d Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe provides a meaningful measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing our ability to repay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and return capital to investors through stock repurchases and dividends. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations, including that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary payments, such as mandatory debt repayments, are not deducted from the measure. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separately in our Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Connectivity & Platforms, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Connectivity & Platforms business, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the businesses, and we believe they are helpful for investors because such measures present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate their underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. Other Adjustments We also present adjusted information (e.g., Adjusted Revenues), to exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges. This adjusted information is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe, among other things, that the adjusted information may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations and can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons. Pro Forma Information Pro forma information is used by management to evaluate performance when certain acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical information reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma information enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the information as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of a preceding year. Our pro forma information is adjusted for the timing of acquisitions or dispositions, the effects of acquisition accounting and the elimination of costs and expenses directly related to the transaction, but does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma information is not a non-GAAP financial measure under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Our pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of future results or what our results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us during the pro forma period. -;-",0001166691,CMCSA,"8-K:8-K 1 cmcsa-20231026.htm 8-K cmcsa-20231026 false 0001166691 0001166691 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 us-gaap:CommonClassAMember 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes0000PercentDue2026Member 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes0.250percentDue2027Member 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes1.500percentDue2029Member 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes0250PercentDue2029Member 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes0.750percentdue2032Member 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes1.875percentdue2036Member 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes1.250percentdue2040Member 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes5.50PercentDue2029Member 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 0001166691 cmcsa:ExchangeableSubordinatedDebentures2.0PercentDue2029Member 2023-10-26 2023-10-26 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of report (Date of earliest event reported): October 26, 2023 Comcast Corporation (Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in its Charter) Pennsylvania (State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation) 001-32871 27-0000798 (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer Identification No.) One Comcast Center Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838 (Address of Principal Executive Offices) (Zip Code) Registrant’s telephone number, including area code: ( 215 ) 286-1700 (Former Name or Former Address, if Changed Since Last Report) Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions: ☐ Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) ☐ Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) ☐ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) ☐ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c)) Securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act: Title of Each Class Trading symbol(s) Name of Each Exchange on Which Registered Class A Common Stock, $0.01 par value CMCSA The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 0.000% Notes due 2026 CMCS26 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 0.250% Notes due 2027 CMCS27 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 1.500% Notes due 2029 CMCS29 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 0.250% Notes due 2029 CMCS29A The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 0.750% Notes due 2032 CMCS32 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 1.875% Notes due 2036 CMCS36 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 1.250% Notes due 2040 CMCS40 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 5.50% Notes due 2029 CCGBP29 New York Stock Exchange 2.0% Exchangeable Subordinated Debentures due 2029 CCZ New York Stock Exchange Indicate by check mark whether the registrant is an emerging growth company as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933 (§230.405 of this chapter) or Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (§240.12b-2 of this chapter).

Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented as year/year basis point changes. Revenue for Residential Connectivity & Platforms increased but was consistent with the prior year period when excluding the positive impact of foreign currency. Growth in residential connectivity revenue was driven by: international connectivity revenue due to an increase in broadband revenue and wireless revenue, reflecting higher sales of devices and wireless services, as well as the positive impact of foreign currency; domestic broadband revenue primarily due to higher average rates; and domestic wireless revenue primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines. The growth in residential connectivity revenue was partially offset by: a decrease in video revenue due to a decline in the number of video customers, partially offset by an increase in average rates and the positive impact of foreign currency; lower advertising revenue primarily due to a decline in domestic political advertising; and lower 3 other revenue primarily due to lower residential wireline voice revenue, driven by a decline in the number of customers. Adjusted EBITDA for Residential Connectivity & Platforms increased due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses, which includes the impact of foreign currency. Programming expenses were consistent with the prior year period, driven by the decline in the number of domestic video customers, offset by domestic contractual rate increases, an increase in programming expenses for international sports channels and the impact of foreign currency. Non-programming expenses decreased primarily due to lower spending on marketing and promotion, lower fees paid to third-party channels related to advertising sales and lower technical and support costs. These decreases were partially offset by increased direct product costs associated with our wireless service, from increases in device sales and the number of customers receiving our wireless service, and our broadband services and by the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 38.4% .

Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented as year/year basis point changes. Revenue for Business Services Connectivity increased due to an increase in revenue from small business customers, driven by higher average rates, and an increase in revenue from medium-sized and enterprise customers. Adjusted EBITDA for Business Services Connectivity increased due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in direct product costs, technical and support expenses and costs related to our sales force. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 57.5%. 4 Content & Experiences ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Content & Experiences Revenue Media $6,029 $6,005 0.4 % Studios 2,518 3,296 (23.6 %) Theme Parks 2,418 2,064 17.2 % Headquarters & Other 13 22 (39.5 %) Eliminations (419) (909) 53.8 % Total Content & Experiences Revenue $10,559 $10,477 0.8 % Content & Experiences Adjusted EBITDA Media $723 $679 6.5 % Studios 429 551 (22.2 %) Theme Parks 983 819 20.0 % Headquarters & Other (178) (199) 10.7 % Eliminations 17 (59) NM Total Content & Experiences Adjusted EBITDA $1,973 $1,791 10.2 % NM=comparison not meaningful. Revenue for Content & Experiences increased compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for Content & Experiences increased primarily due to growth in Theme Parks and moderating Peacock Adjusted EBITDA losses. Media ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Revenue Domestic Advertising $1,913 $2,089 (8.4 %) Domestic Distribution 2,591 2,497 3.8 % International Networks 1,019 872 16.9 % Other 506 547 (7.6 %) Total Revenue $6,029 $6,005 0.4 % Operating Expenses 5,306 5,326 (0.4 %) Adjusted EBITDA $723 $679 6.5 % Revenue for Media increased primarily due to higher international networks and domestic distribution revenue, partially offset by lower domestic advertising and other revenue. International networks revenue increased primarily reflecting an increase in revenue associated with the distribution of sports channels and the positive impact of foreign currency. Domestic distribution revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue at Peacock, driven by an increase in paid subscribers, partially offset by lower revenue at our networks. The decrease in domestic advertising revenue was primarily due to lower revenue at our networks, partially offset by an increase in revenue at Peacock. Adjusted EBITDA for Media increased due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses was due to lower marketing and promotion expenses. Programming and production costs were consistent, reflecting higher programming costs at Peacock and increased sports programming costs, offset by a decrease in content costs at our entertainment television networks. Media results in the third quarter include $830 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA 8 loss of $565 million related to Peacock, compared to $506 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA 8 loss of $614 million in the prior year period. 5 Studios ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Revenue Content Licensing $1,691 $2,267 (25.4 %) Theatrical 504 673 (25.1 %) Other 324 356 (9.0 %) Total Revenue $2,518 $3,296 (23.6 %) Operating Expenses 2,089 2,744 (23.9 %) Adjusted EBITDA $429 $551 (22.2 %) Revenue for Studios decreased primarily due to lower content licensing revenue and theatrical revenue. Content licensing revenue decreased primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios, including the impacts of the Writers Guild and Screen Actors Guild work stoppages in the current year period. Theatrical revenue declined primarily due to higher revenue from theatrical releases in the prior year period, including Minions: The Rise of Gru and Jurassic World: Dominion , partially offset by the successful performance of Oppenheimer in the current year period. Adjusted EBITDA for Studios decreased due to lower revenue, which more than offset lower operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses primarily reflected lower programming and production expenses, mainly due to lower costs associated with lower content licensing sales, including the impacts of the work stoppages in the current year period. Theme Parks ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 Change Revenue $2,418 $2,064 17.2 % Operating Expenses 1,435 1,244 15.4 % Adjusted EBITDA $983 $819 20.0 % Revenue for Theme Parks increased driven by higher revenue at our international theme parks, which had COVID-19 related restrictions in the prior year period, and higher revenue at our domestic theme parks, including Universal Studios Hollywood due to the continued success of Super Nintendo World, partially offset by lower revenue at our theme park in Orlando which continued to be above comparable pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Adjusted EBITDA for Theme Parks increased, reflecting higher revenue, which more than offset higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher costs primarily associated with increased guest attendance. Headquarters & Other Content & Experiences Headquarters & Other includes overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives. Headquarters & Other Adjusted EBITDA loss in the third quarter was $178 million, compared to a loss of $199 million in the prior year period. Eliminations Amounts represent eliminations of transactions between our Content & Experiences segments, the most significant being content licensing between the Studios and Media segments, which are affected by the timing of recognition of content licenses. Revenue eliminations were $419 million, compared to $909 million in the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a benefit of $17 million, compared to a loss of $59 million in the prior year period. 6 Corporate, Other and Eliminations ($ in millions) 3rd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Corporate & Other Revenue $643 $601 7.0 % Operating Expenses 893 919 (2.9 %) Adjusted EBITDA ($249) ($318) 21.6 % Eliminations Revenue ($1,358) ($1,277) 6.3 % Operating Expenses (1,375) (1,303) 5.5 % Adjusted EBITDA $16 $26 36.5 % Corporate & Other Corporate & Other primarily includes overhead and personnel costs; certain Sky operations; Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture beginning in June 2022. Eliminations Amounts represent eliminations of transactions between Connectivity & Platforms, Content & Experiences and other businesses, the most significant being distribution of television network programming between the Media and Residential Connectivity & Platforms segments. Revenue eliminations were $1.4 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a benefit of $16 million compared to a benefit of $26 million in the prior year period. 7 Notes: 1 We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. See Table 5 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 2 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 3 All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. 4 We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 5 Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our presentation of segment operating results around our two primary businesses, Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. We have updated certain historical information as a result of these changes, including: (1) presentation of Cable Communications results in the Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments and (2) presentation of Sky's results across the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Entertainment segments, and Corporate & Other. 6 Constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. See Table 6 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 7 Customer metrics for 2022 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certain customers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. These changes in methodology were not material to any period presented. Previously reported total Sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of December 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets. 8 Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of profit or loss for our segments. From time to time, we may present Adjusted EBITDA for components of our reportable segments, such as Peacock. We believe these measures are useful to evaluate our financial results and provide a basis of comparison to others, although our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA for components are generally presented on a consistent basis with the respective segments and include direct revenue and operating costs and expenses attributed to the component operations. Numerical information is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. ### 8 Conference Call and Other Information Comcast Corporation will host a conference call with the financial community today, October 26, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).

Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented as year/year basis point changes. Revenue for Residential Connectivity & Platforms was consistent with the prior year period. Growth in residential connectivity revenue was driven by domestic broadband revenue due to higher average rates; international connectivity revenue due to an increase in wireless revenue, reflecting higher sales of devices and wireless services, as well as an increase in broadband revenue; and domestic wireless revenue due to an increase in the number of customer lines. The growth in residential connectivity revenue was offset by a decrease in video revenue due to a decline in the number of video customers, partially offset by an increase in average rates; other revenue primarily due to lower voice revenue, driven by a decline in the number of residential wireline voice customers; and advertising revenue primarily due to a decline in domestic political advertising and overall market weakness. 3 Adjusted EBITDA for Residential Connectivity & Platforms increased due to lower operating expenses. Programming expenses decreased primarily due to the decline in the number of domestic video customers, partially offset by domestic contractual rate increases and an increase in programming expenses for international sports channels. Non-programming expenses decreased primarily due to lower spending on marketing and promotion, lower technical and support costs, lower fees paid to third-party channels relating to advertising sales and lower customer service costs. These decreases were partially offset by increased direct product costs associated with our wireless service, resulting from increases in device sales and the number of customers receiving our wireless service. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 38.9% .

Revenue for Business Services Connectivity increased due to an increase in revenue from small, medium-sized and enterprise customers. Adjusted EBITDA for Business Services Connectivity increased due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher marketing and promotion expenses and direct product costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 57.7%. 4 Content & Experiences ($ in millions) 2nd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Content & Experiences Revenue Media $6,195 $6,188 0.1 % Studios 3,087 3,117 (0.9 %) Theme Parks 2,209 1,804 22.4 % Headquarters & Other 13 8 60.5 % Eliminations (631) (664) 5.0 % Total Content & Experiences Revenue $10,873 $10,453 4.0 % Content & Experiences Adjusted EBITDA Media $1,244 $1,520 (18.2 %) Studios 255 (3) NM Theme Parks 833 632 31.8 % Headquarters & Other (200) (137) (45.6 %) Eliminations 56 23 141.8 % Total Content & Experiences Adjusted EBITDA $2,187 $2,034 7.5 % NM=comparison not meaningful. Revenue for Content & Experiences increased compared to the prior year period driven by Theme Parks. Adjusted EBITDA for Content & Experiences increased due to growth in Studios and Theme Parks, partially offset by a decrease in Media, driven by higher costs at Peacock as the service scales. Media ($ in millions) 2nd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Revenue Domestic Advertising $2,027 $2,131 (4.9 %) Domestic Distribution 2,615 2,558 2.2 % International Networks 1,035 970 6.7 % Other 518 529 (2.0 %) Total Revenue $6,195 $6,188 0.1 % Operating Expenses 4,951 4,669 6.0 % Adjusted EBITDA $1,244 $1,520 (18.2 %) Revenue for Media was consistent with the prior year period primarily due to higher international networks and domestic distribution revenue, offset by lower domestic advertising revenue. The decrease in domestic advertising revenue was primarily due to lower revenue at our networks, partially offset by an increase in revenue at Peacock. International networks revenue increased primarily reflecting an increase in revenue associated with the distribution of sports channels. Domestic distribution revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue at Peacock, driven by an increase in paid subscribers, partially offset by lower revenue at our networks. Adjusted EBITDA for Media decreased primarily due to higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher programming costs at Peacock, as well as increased international sports programming costs driven by the shift of certain European football matches and the related programming expense to the first half of 2023 due to timing of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, partially offset by a decrease in content costs for our entertainment television networks. Media results in the second quarter include $820 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA 8 loss of $651 million related to Peacock, compared to $444 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA 8 loss of $467 million in the prior year period. 5 Studios ($ in millions) 2nd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Revenue Content Licensing $1,821 $2,269 (19.8 %) Theatrical 913 550 65.9 % Other 354 298 19.0 % Total Revenue $3,087 $3,117 (0.9 %) Operating Expenses 2,833 3,120 (9.2 %) Adjusted EBITDA $255 ($3) NM NM=comparison not meaningful. Revenue for Studios was consistent with the prior year period primarily due to higher theatrical revenue, driven by recent releases, including The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Fast X , offset by lower content licensing revenue, which was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios under licensing agreements, partially offset by the timing of when content was made available by our film studios. Adjusted EBITDA for Studios increased primarily due to lower operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses reflected lower programming and production expenses, primarily due to lower costs associated with lower content licensing sales, partially offset by higher spending on recent theatrical releases. Theme Parks ($ in millions) 2nd Quarter 2023 2022 Change Revenue $2,209 $1,804 22.4 % Operating Expenses 1,376 1,173 17.4 % Adjusted EBITDA $833 $632 31.8 % Revenue for Theme Parks increased driven by higher revenue at our international theme parks, which had COVID-19 related restrictions in the prior year period. Domestic theme parks revenue remained consistent primarily due to higher revenue at our theme park in Hollywood driven by the opening of Super Nintendo World, offset by lower revenue at our theme park in Orlando which continues to be above pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted EBITDA for Theme Parks increased, reflecting higher revenue, which more than offset higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher costs primarily associated with increased guest attendance. Headquarters & Other Content & Experiences Headquarters & Other includes overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives. Headquarters & Other Adjusted EBITDA loss in the second quarter was $200 million, compared to a loss of $137 million in the prior year period. Eliminations Amounts represent eliminations of transactions between our Content & Experiences segments, the most significant being content licensing between the Studios and Media segments, which are affected by the timing of recognition of content licenses. Revenue eliminations were $631 million, compared to $664 million in the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a benefit of $56 million, compared to a benefit of $23 million in the prior year period. 6 Corporate, Other and Eliminations ($ in millions) 2nd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Corporate & Other Revenue $654 $617 6.0 % Operating Expenses 957 784 22.1 % Adjusted EBITDA ($303) ($167) (81.4 %) Eliminations Revenue ($1,373) ($1,389) (1.2 %) Operating Expenses (1,386) (1,353) 2.5 % Adjusted EBITDA $14 ($36) NM NM=comparison not meaningful. Corporate & Other Corporate & Other primarily includes overhead and personnel costs; certain Sky operations; Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture beginning in June 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss for Corporate & Other increased, reflecting higher operating expenses primarily due to higher costs related to Xumo and certain Sky operations. Eliminations Amounts represent eliminations of transactions between Connectivity & Platforms, Content & Experiences and other businesses, the most significant being distribution of television network programming between the Media and Residential Connectivity & Platforms segments. Revenue eliminations were $1.4 billion, consistent with the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a benefit of $14 million compared to a loss of $36 million in the prior year period. 7 Notes: 1 We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. See Table 5 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 2 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 3 All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. 4 We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 5 Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our presentation of segment operating results around our two primary businesses, Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. We have updated certain historical information as a result of these changes, including: (1) presentation of Cable Communications results in the Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments and (2) presentation of Sky's results across the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Entertainment segments, and Corporate & Other. 6 Constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. See Table 6 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 7 Customer metrics for 2022 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certain customers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. These changes in methodology were not material to any period presented. Previously reported total Sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of December 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets. 8 Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of profit or loss for our segments. From time to time, we may present Adjusted EBITDA for components of our reportable segments, such as Peacock. We believe these measures are useful to evaluate our financial results and provide a basis of comparison to others, although our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA for components are generally presented on a consistent basis with the respective segments and include direct revenue and operating costs and expenses attributed to the component operations. Numerical information is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. ### 8 Conference Call and Other Information Comcast Corporation will host a conference call with the financial community today, July 27, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).

To the extent material, this Exhibit also discloses the additional purposes, if any, for which our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings press release itself. Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, net income attributable to Comcast Corporation, earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is the primary basis used to measure the operational strength and performance of our businesses as well as to assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our businesses. This measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. It is also unaffected by our capital and tax structures, and by our investment activities, including the results of entities that we do not consolidate, as our management excludes these results when evaluating our operating performance. Our management and Board of Directors use this financial measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as the measure of profit or loss for our segments. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA for our segments is not a non-GAAP financial measure under rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures presenting the earnings generated by our ongoing operations that we believe is useful to investors in making meaningful comparisons to other companies, although these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies, and period-over-period comparisons. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are defined as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. Acquisition-related intangible assets are recognized as a result of the application of Accounting Standards Codification Topic (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (such as customer relationships), and their amortization is significantly affected by the size and timing of our acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets not resulting from business combinations (such as software and acquired intellectual property rights used in our theme parks) is included in Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS. Investments that investors may want to evaluate separately include all equity securities accounted for under ASC Topic 321, Investments-Equity Securities , as well as certain investments accounted for under ASC 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures. Exhibit 99.2 - Explanation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures, cont’d Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe provides a meaningful measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing our ability to repay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, and return capital to investors through stock repurchases and dividends. It is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. Additionally, we believe Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a basis for comparing our performance and coverage ratios with other companies in our industries, although our measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations, including that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary payments, such as mandatory debt repayments, are not deducted from the measure. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separately in our Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. Constant Currency Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are non-GAAP financial measures that present our results of operations excluding the estimated effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Certain of our businesses, including Connectivity & Platforms, have operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In our Connectivity & Platforms business, we use constant currency and constant currency growth rates to evaluate the underlying performance of the businesses, and we believe they are helpful for investors because such measures present operating results on a comparable basis year over year to evaluate their underlying performance. Constant currency and constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current year period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. Other Adjustments We also present adjusted information (e.g., Adjusted Revenues), to exclude the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges. This adjusted information is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe, among other things, that the adjusted information may help investors evaluate our ongoing operations and can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons. Pro Forma Information Pro forma information is used by management to evaluate performance when certain acquisitions or dispositions occur. Historical information reflects results of acquired businesses only after the acquisition dates while pro forma information enhances comparability of financial information between periods by adjusting the information as if the acquisitions or dispositions occurred at the beginning of a preceding year. Our pro forma information is adjusted for the timing of acquisitions or dispositions, the effects of acquisition accounting and the elimination of costs and expenses directly related to the transaction, but does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities, cost savings or synergies that have been or may be achieved by the combined businesses. Pro forma information is not a non-GAAP financial measure under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Our pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of future results or what our results would have been had the acquired businesses been operated by us during the pro forma period. -;-",0001166691,CMCSA,"8-K:8-K 1 cmcsa-20230727.htm 8-K cmcsa-20230727 false 0001166691 0001166691 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 us-gaap:CommonClassAMember 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes0000PercentDue2026Member 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes0.250percentDue2027Member 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes1.500percentDue2029Member 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes0250PercentDue2029Member 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes0.750percentdue2032Member 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes1.875percentdue2036Member 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes1.250percentdue2040Member 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 cmcsa:Notes5.50PercentDue2029Member 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 0001166691 cmcsa:ExchangeableSubordinatedDebentures2.0PercentDue2029Member 2023-07-27 2023-07-27 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of report (Date of earliest event reported): July 27, 2023 Comcast Corporation (Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in its Charter) Pennsylvania (State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation) 001-32871 27-0000798 (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer Identification No.) One Comcast Center Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838 (Address of Principal Executive Offices) (Zip Code) Registrant’s telephone number, including area code: ( 215 ) 286-1700 (Former Name or Former Address, if Changed Since Last Report) Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions: ☐ Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) ☐ Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) ☐ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) ☐ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c)) Securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act: Title of Each Class Trading symbol(s) Name of Each Exchange on Which Registered Class A Common Stock, $0.01 par value CMCSA The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 0.000% Notes due 2026 CMCS26 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 0.250% Notes due 2027 CMCS27 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 1.500% Notes due 2029 CMCS29 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 0.250% Notes due 2029 CMCS29A The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 0.750% Notes due 2032 CMCS32 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 1.875% Notes due 2036 CMCS36 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 1.250% Notes due 2040 CMCS40 The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 5.50% Notes due 2029 CCGBP29 New York Stock Exchange 2.0% Exchangeable Subordinated Debentures due 2029 CCZ New York Stock Exchange Indicate by check mark whether the registrant is an emerging growth company as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933 (§230.405 of this chapter) or Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (§240.12b-2 of this chapter).

Change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is presented as year/year basis point changes. Revenue for Residential Connectivity & Platforms was consistent with the prior year period. Growth in residential connectivity revenue was driven by domestic broadband revenue due to higher average rates; international connectivity revenue due to an increase in wireless revenue, reflecting higher sales of devices and wireless services, as well as an increase in broadband revenue; and domestic wireless revenue due to an increase in the number of customer lines. The growth in residential connectivity revenue was offset by a decrease in video revenue due to a decline in the number of video customers, partially offset by an increase in average rates; other revenue primarily due to lower voice revenue, driven by a decline in the number of residential wireline voice customers; and advertising revenue primarily due to a decline in domestic political advertising and overall market weakness. 3 Adjusted EBITDA for Residential Connectivity & Platforms increased due to lower operating expenses. Programming expenses decreased primarily due to the decline in the number of domestic video customers, partially offset by domestic contractual rate increases and an increase in programming expenses for international sports channels. Non-programming expenses decreased primarily due to lower spending on marketing and promotion, lower technical and support costs, lower fees paid to third-party channels relating to advertising sales and lower customer service costs. These decreases were partially offset by increased direct product costs associated with our wireless service, resulting from increases in device sales and the number of customers receiving our wireless service.

The decrease in domestic advertising revenue was primarily due to lower revenue at our networks, partially offset by an increase in revenue at Peacock. International networks revenue increased primarily reflecting an increase in revenue associated with the distribution of sports channels. Domestic distribution revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue at Peacock, driven by an increase in paid subscribers, partially offset by lower revenue at our networks. Adjusted EBITDA for Media decreased primarily due to higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher programming costs at Peacock, as well as increased international sports programming costs driven by the shift of certain European football matches and the related programming expense to the first half of 2023 due to timing of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, partially offset by a decrease in content costs for our entertainment television networks. Media results in the second quarter include $820 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA 8 loss of $651 million related to Peacock, compared to $444 million of revenue and an Adjusted EBITDA 8 loss of $467 million in the prior year period. 5 Studios ($ in millions) 2nd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Revenue Content Licensing $1,821 $2,269 (19.8 %) Theatrical 913 550 65.9 % Other 354 298 19.0 % Total Revenue $3,087 $3,117 (0.9 %) Operating Expenses 2,833 3,120 (9.2 %) Adjusted EBITDA $255 ($3) NM NM=comparison not meaningful. Revenue for Studios was consistent with the prior year period primarily due to higher theatrical revenue, driven by recent releases, including The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Fast X , offset by lower content licensing revenue, which was primarily due to the timing of when content was made available by our television studios under licensing agreements, partially offset by the timing of when content was made available by our film studios. Adjusted EBITDA for Studios increased primarily due to lower operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses reflected lower programming and production expenses, primarily due to lower costs associated with lower content licensing sales, partially offset by higher spending on recent theatrical releases. Theme Parks ($ in millions) 2nd Quarter 2023 2022 Change Revenue $2,209 $1,804 22.4 % Operating Expenses 1,376 1,173 17.4 % Adjusted EBITDA $833 $632 31.8 % Revenue for Theme Parks increased driven by higher revenue at our international theme parks, which had COVID-19 related restrictions in the prior year period. Domestic theme parks revenue remained consistent primarily due to higher revenue at our theme park in Hollywood driven by the opening of Super Nintendo World, offset by lower revenue at our theme park in Orlando which continues to be above pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted EBITDA for Theme Parks increased, reflecting higher revenue, which more than offset higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was due to higher costs primarily associated with increased guest attendance. Headquarters & Other Content & Experiences Headquarters & Other includes overhead, personnel costs and costs associated with corporate initiatives. Headquarters & Other Adjusted EBITDA loss in the second quarter was $200 million, compared to a loss of $137 million in the prior year period. Eliminations Amounts represent eliminations of transactions between our Content & Experiences segments, the most significant being content licensing between the Studios and Media segments, which are affected by the timing of recognition of content licenses. Revenue eliminations were $631 million, compared to $664 million in the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a benefit of $56 million, compared to a benefit of $23 million in the prior year period. 6 Corporate, Other and Eliminations ($ in millions) 2nd Quarter 2023 2022 5 Change Corporate & Other Revenue $654 $617 6.0 % Operating Expenses 957 784 22.1 % Adjusted EBITDA ($303) ($167) (81.4 %) Eliminations Revenue ($1,373) ($1,389) (1.2 %) Operating Expenses (1,386) (1,353) 2.5 % Adjusted EBITDA $14 ($36) NM NM=comparison not meaningful. Corporate & Other Corporate & Other primarily includes overhead and personnel costs; certain Sky operations; Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture beginning in June 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss for Corporate & Other increased, reflecting higher operating expenses primarily due to higher costs related to Xumo and certain Sky operations. Eliminations Amounts represent eliminations of transactions between Connectivity & Platforms, Content & Experiences and other businesses, the most significant being distribution of television network programming between the Media and Residential Connectivity & Platforms segments. Revenue eliminations were $1.4 billion, consistent with the prior year period, and Adjusted EBITDA eliminations were a benefit of $14 million compared to a loss of $36 million in the prior year period. 7 Notes: 1 We define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation and diluted earnings per common share attributable to Comcast Corporation shareholders, respectively, adjusted to exclude the effects of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments that investors may want to evaluate separately (such as based on fair value) and the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges that affect period-over-period comparisons. See Table 5 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 2 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax expense, investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 3 All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. 4 We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Cash payments related to certain capital or intangible assets, such as the construction of Universal Beijing Resort, are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets for Free Cash Flow. See Table 4 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measure. 5 Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our presentation of segment operating results around our two primary businesses, Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Experiences. We have updated certain historical information as a result of these changes, including: (1) presentation of Cable Communications results in the Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity segments and (2) presentation of Sky's results across the Connectivity & Platforms and Content & Entertainment segments, and Corporate & Other. 6 Constant currency growth rates are calculated by comparing the results for each comparable prior year period adjusted to reflect the average exchange rates from each current period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates that were in effect during the respective periods. See Table 6 for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. 7 Customer metrics for 2022 have been updated to reflect the new segment presentation, and to align methodologies for counting business customer metrics to: (1) include locations receiving our services outside of our distribution system and (2) now count certain customers based on the number of locations receiving services, including arrangements whereby third parties provide connectivity services leveraging our distribution system. These changes in methodology were not material to any period presented. Previously reported total Sky customer relationships of approximately 23 million as of December 31, 2022 also included approximately 5 million customer relationships outside of the Connectivity & Platforms markets. 8 Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of profit or loss for our segments. From time to time, we may present Adjusted EBITDA for components of our reportable segments, such as Peacock. We believe these measures are useful to evaluate our financial results and provide a basis of comparison to others, although our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA for components are generally presented on a consistent basis with the respective segments and include direct revenue and operating costs and expenses attributed to the component operations. Numerical information is presented on a rounded basis using actual amounts. Minor differences in totals and percentage calculations may exist due to rounding. ### 8 Conference Call and Other Information Comcast Corporation will host a conference call with the financial community today, July 27, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).

A copy of the news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. All information in the news release is furnished but not filed. Non-GAAP Financial Information In the attached news release Accenture discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures: • Free cash flow (defined as operating cash flow net of property and equipment additions). Accenture’s management believes that this information provides meaningful additional information regarding the company’s liquidity. • Percentage changes in revenues on a local currency basis. Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Accenture’s management believes that information regarding changes in its revenues that excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates facilitates meaningful comparison of its revenues. • Diluted earnings per share, effective tax rate, net income and provision for income taxes excluding charges associated with tax law changes in fiscal 2018. Accenture’s management believes that information regarding the effect of the tax law changes on diluted earnings per share, effective tax rate, net income and provision for income taxes facilitates an understanding as to the impact of the charges and the company’s financial performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are included in the news release. While Accenture’s management believes that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating Accenture’s operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Diluted earnings per share were $1.93, compared with $1.60 for the third quarter last year, which included a $0.19 charge related to tax law changes. Diluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 8 percent from adjusted diluted EPS of $1.79 in the same period last year. Operating income was $1.72 billion, a 5 percent increase over the same period last year, and operating margin was 15.5 percent, an expansion of 20 basis points. New bookings for the quarter were $10.6 billion, with consulting bookings of $6.0 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.6 billion. David Rowland, Accenture’s interim chief executive officer, said, “We are very pleased with our strong third-quarter financial results and the continued momentum in our business. With revenue growth of 8.4 percent in local currency, we again gained significant market share. We also delivered strong profitability, generated outstanding free cash flow and returned $1.4 billion in cash to our shareholders. “The strength and consistency of our performance reflect the unique diversity of Accenture’s business — from an industry, geographic and capability standpoint — as well as the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. Our substantial investments in strategic, high-growth areas are clearly differentiating us and driving growth ahead of the market. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering profitable growth and significant value for our clients and shareholders.” Financial Review Effective Sept. 1, 2018, Accenture adopted new accounting standards that affect the accounting for revenue and pension costs. Prior-period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation, and the revised fiscal 2018 results are available at investor.accenture.com . Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were $11.10 billion, compared with $10.69 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 4 percent in U.S. dollars and 8.4 percent in local currency, at the top of the company’s guided range of $10.80 billion to $11.10 billion. The foreign-exchange impact for the quarter was approximately negative 4.5 percent, consistent with the assumption provided in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. ▪ Consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.24 billion, an increase of 3 percent in U.S. dollars and 7 percent in local currency compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018. ▪ Outsourcing revenues were $4.86 billion, an increase of 5 percent in U.S. dollars and 10 percent in local currency compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Diluted EPS for the quarter were $1.93 compared with $1.60 for the third quarter last year, which included a $0.19 charge related to tax law changes. Excluding this charge, EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $1.79. The $0.14, or 8 percent, increase in EPS on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 reflects: ▪ a $0.09 increase from higher revenue and operating results; ▪ a $0.03 increase from a lower effective tax rate; ▪ a $0.02 increase from a lower share count; and ▪ a $0.01 increase from lower non-operating expense; partially offset by ▪ a $0.01 decrease from higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) for the quarter was 31.8 percent, compared with 31.2 percent for the third quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the quarter were $1.81 billion, or 16.3 percent of revenues, compared with $1.70 billion, or 15.9 percent of revenues, for the third quarter last year. Operating income for the quarter increased 5 percent, to $1.72 billion, or 15.5 percent of revenues, compared with $1.63 billion, or 15.3 percent of revenues, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.6 percent, compared with 34.4 percent for the third quarter last year. Excluding the charge related to tax law changes, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 26.8 percent. Net income for the quarter was $1.27 billion, compared with $1.06 billion for the third quarter last year. Excluding the charge related to tax law changes, net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.18 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.12 billion and property and equipment additions were $140 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow net of property and equipment additions, was $1.98 billion for the quarter. For the same period last year, operating cash flow was $1.99 billion; property and equipment additions were $174 million; and free cash flow was $1.81 billion. Days services outstanding, or DSOs, were 39 days at May 31, 2019, compared with 39 days at both Aug. 31, 2018 and May 31, 2018. Accenture’s total cash balance at May 31, 2019 was $4.8 billion, compared with $5.1 billion at Aug. 31, 2018. New Bookings New bookings for the third quarter were $10.6 billion and reflect a negative 4 percent foreign-currency impact compared with new bookings in the third quarter last year. ▪ Consulting new bookings were $6.0 billion, or 57 percent of total new bookings. ▪ Outsourcing new bookings were $4.6 billion, or 43 percent of total new bookings. Revenues by Operating Group Revenues by operating group were as follows: ▪ Communications, Media & Technology: $2.25 billion, compared with $2.19 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 3 percent in U.S. dollars and 7 percent in local currency. ▪ Financial Services: $2.20 billion, compared with $2.23 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 2 percent in U.S. dollars and an increase of 4 percent in local currency. ▪ Health & Public Service: $1.82 billion, compared with $1.75 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 4 percent in U.S. dollars and 6 percent in local currency. ▪ Products: $3.08 billion, compared with $2.97 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 4 percent in U.S. dollars and 8 percent in local currency. ▪ Resources: $1.75 billion, compared with $1.55 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 13 percent in U.S. dollars and 19 percent in local currency. Revenues by Geographic Region Revenues by geographic region were as follows: ▪ North America: $5.15 billion, compared with $4.74 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 9 percent in both U.S. dollars and local currency. ▪ Europe: $3.77 billion, compared with $3.88 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 3 percent in U.S. dollars and an increase of 5 percent in local currency. ▪ Growth Markets: $2.18 billion, compared with $2.08 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 5 percent in U.S. dollars and 13 percent in local currency. Returning Cash to Shareholders Accenture continues to return cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. Dividend On May 15, 2019, a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.46 per share was paid to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 11, 2019. Combined with the semi-annual cash dividend of $1.46 per share paid on Nov. 15, 2018, this brings the total dividend payments for the fiscal year to $2.92 per share, for total cash dividend payments of approximately $1.86 billion. As previously disclosed, the company plans to begin paying dividends on a quarterly basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Share Repurchase Activity During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Accenture repurchased or redeemed 2.8 million shares, including 2.7 million shares repurchased in the open market, for a total of $488 million. This brings Accenture’s total share repurchases and redemptions for the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 to 14.4 million shares, including 11.6 million shares repurchased in the open market, for a total of $2.28 billion. Accenture’s total remaining share repurchase authority at May 31, 2019 was approximately $4.1 billion. At May 31, 2019, Accenture had approximately 638 million total shares outstanding. Business Outlook As described in the Financial Review above, Accenture has adopted new accounting standards that affect the accounting for revenue and pension costs. Accenture’s business outlook for fiscal 2019 and comparisons to fiscal 2018 include the impact of these new standards. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Accenture expects revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to be in the range of $10.85 billion to $11.15 billion, 5 percent to 8 percent growth in local currency, reflecting the company’s assumption of a negative 2 percent foreign-exchange impact compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Fiscal Year 2019 Accenture’s business outlook for the full 2019 fiscal year continues to assume that the foreign-exchange impact on its results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 3 percent compared with fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, the company now expects revenue growth to be in the range of 8 percent to 9 percent in local currency, compared with 6.5 percent to 8.5 percent previously. The company now expects diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.35, compared with $7.18 to $7.32 previously. Accenture now expects operating margin for the full fiscal year to be 14.6 percent, an expansion of 20 basis points from operating margin for fiscal 2018 of 14.4 percent, which reflects the impact of the new revenue and pension accounting standards. The company previously expected operating margin to expand 10 to 30 basis points. For fiscal 2019, the company continues to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $5.85 billion to $6.25 billion; property and equipment additions to be $650 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion. The company continues to expect its annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5 percent to 23.5 percent.

In connection with the fiscal year 2019 adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09: “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606), the Net revenues and reimbursements lines were eliminated. Effective September 1, 2018, we also adopted ASU No 2017-07: “Compensation Retirement Benefits” (Topic 715) which required us to reclassify certain components of pension service costs from Operating expenses to Non-operating expenses. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation. (2) Comprised primarily of noncontrolling interest attributable to the noncontrolling shareholders of Avanade, Inc. (3) Diluted earnings per share assumes the exchange of all Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis and the redemption of all Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares owned by holders of noncontrolling interests prior to March 13, 2018, when these were redeemed for Accenture class A ordinary shares. The income effect does not take into account “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests — other,” since those shares are not redeemable or exchangeable for Accenture plc Class A ordinary shares.

A copy of the news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. All information in the news release is furnished but not filed. Non-GAAP Financial Information In the attached news release Accenture discloses the following non-GAAP financial measures: • Free cash flow (defined as operating cash flow net of property and equipment additions). Accenture’s management believes that this information provides meaningful additional information regarding the company’s liquidity. • Percentage changes in revenues on a local currency basis. Financial results in local currency are calculated by restating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period’s foreign currency exchange rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Accenture’s management believes that information regarding changes in its revenues that excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates facilitates meaningful comparison of its revenues. • Diluted earnings per share, effective tax rate, net income and provision for income taxes excluding charges associated with tax law changes in fiscal 2018. Accenture’s management believes that information regarding the effect of the tax law changes on diluted earnings per share, effective tax rate, net income and provision for income taxes facilitates an understanding as to the impact of the charges and the company’s financial performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are included in the news release. While Accenture’s management believes that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating Accenture’s operations, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Diluted earnings per share were $1.93, compared with $1.60 for the third quarter last year, which included a $0.19 charge related to tax law changes. Diluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 8 percent from adjusted diluted EPS of $1.79 in the same period last year.

We also delivered strong profitability, generated outstanding free cash flow and returned $1.4 billion in cash to our shareholders. “The strength and consistency of our performance reflect the unique diversity of Accenture’s business — from an industry, geographic and capability standpoint — as well as the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. Our substantial investments in strategic, high-growth areas are clearly differentiating us and driving growth ahead of the market. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering profitable growth and significant value for our clients and shareholders.” Financial Review Effective Sept. 1, 2018, Accenture adopted new accounting standards that affect the accounting for revenue and pension costs. Prior-period results have been revised to reflect the fiscal 2019 presentation, and the revised fiscal 2018 results are available at investor.accenture.com . Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were $11.10 billion, compared with $10.69 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 4 percent in U.S. dollars and 8.4 percent in local currency, at the top of the company’s guided range of $10.80 billion to $11.10 billion. The foreign-exchange impact for the quarter was approximately negative 4.5 percent, consistent with the assumption provided in the company’s second-quarter earnings release. ▪ Consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.24 billion, an increase of 3 percent in U.S. dollars and 7 percent in local currency compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018. ▪ Outsourcing revenues were $4.86 billion, an increase of 5 percent in U.S. dollars and 10 percent in local currency compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the quarter were $1.81 billion, or 16.3 percent of revenues, compared with $1.70 billion, or 15.9 percent of revenues, for the third quarter last year. Operating income for the quarter increased 5 percent, to $1.72 billion, or 15.5 percent of revenues, compared with $1.63 billion, or 15.3 percent of revenues, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.6 percent, compared with 34.4 percent for the third quarter last year. Excluding the charge related to tax law changes, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 26.8 percent. Net income for the quarter was $1.27 billion, compared with $1.06 billion for the third quarter last year. Excluding the charge related to tax law changes, net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.18 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.12 billion and property and equipment additions were $140 million.

Accenture’s total cash balance at May 31, 2019 was $4.8 billion, compared with $5.1 billion at Aug. 31, 2018. New Bookings New bookings for the third quarter were $10.6 billion and reflect a negative 4 percent foreign-currency impact compared with new bookings in the third quarter last year. ▪ Consulting new bookings were $6.0 billion, or 57 percent of total new bookings. ▪ Outsourcing new bookings were $4.6 billion, or 43 percent of total new bookings. Revenues by Operating Group Revenues by operating group were as follows: ▪ Communications, Media & Technology: $2.25 billion, compared with $2.19 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 3 percent in U.S. dollars and 7 percent in local currency. ▪ Financial Services: $2.20 billion, compared with $2.23 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 2 percent in U.S. dollars and an increase of 4 percent in local currency. ▪ Health & Public Service: $1.82 billion, compared with $1.75 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 4 percent in U.S. dollars and 6 percent in local currency. ▪ Products: $3.08 billion, compared with $2.97 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 4 percent in U.S. dollars and 8 percent in local currency. ▪ Resources: $1.75 billion, compared with $1.55 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 13 percent in U.S. dollars and 19 percent in local currency.

Returning Cash to Shareholders Accenture continues to return cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases. Dividend On May 15, 2019, a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.46 per share was paid to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 11, 2019. Combined with the semi-annual cash dividend of $1.46 per share paid on Nov. 15, 2018, this brings the total dividend payments for the fiscal year to $2.92 per share, for total cash dividend payments of approximately $1.86 billion. As previously disclosed, the company plans to begin paying dividends on a quarterly basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Share Repurchase Activity During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, Accenture repurchased or redeemed 2.8 million shares, including 2.7 million shares repurchased in the open market, for a total of $488 million. This brings Accenture’s total share repurchases and redemptions for the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 to 14.4 million shares, including 11.6 million shares repurchased in the open market, for a total of $2.28 billion. Accenture’s total remaining share repurchase authority at May 31, 2019 was approximately $4.1 billion. At May 31, 2019, Accenture had approximately 638 million total shares outstanding. Business Outlook As described in the Financial Review above, Accenture has adopted new accounting standards that affect the accounting for revenue and pension costs. Accenture’s business outlook for fiscal 2019 and comparisons to fiscal 2018 include the impact of these new standards. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Accenture expects revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to be in the range of $10.85 billion to $11.15 billion, 5 percent to 8 percent growth in local currency, reflecting the company’s assumption of a negative 2 percent foreign-exchange impact compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Fiscal Year 2019 Accenture’s business outlook for the full 2019 fiscal year continues to assume that the foreign-exchange impact on its results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 3 percent compared with fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, the company now expects revenue growth to be in the range of 8 percent to 9 percent in local currency, compared with 6.5 percent to 8.5 percent previously. The company now expects diluted EPS to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.35, compared with $7.18 to $7.32 previously. Accenture now expects operating margin for the full fiscal year to be 14.6 percent, an expansion of 20 basis points from operating margin for fiscal 2018 of 14.4 percent, which reflects the impact of the new revenue and pension accounting standards. The company previously expected operating margin to expand 10 to 30 basis points. For fiscal 2019, the company continues to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $5.85 billion to $6.25 billion; property and equipment additions to be $650 million; and free cash flow to be in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion. The company continues to expect its annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5 percent to 23.5 percent.

These include, without limitation, risks that: Accenture’s results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on the company’s clients’ businesses and levels of business activity; Accenture’s business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for the company’s services and solutions including through the adaptation and expansion of its services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the changing technological environment could materially affect the company’s results of operations; if Accenture is unable to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, the company’s business, the utilization rate of the company’s professionals and the company’s results of operations may be materially adversely affected; Accenture could face legal, reputational and financial risks if the company fails to protect client and/or company data from security breaches or cyberattacks; the markets in which Accenture operates are highly competitive, and Accenture might not be able to compete effectively; changes in Accenture’s level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition; Accenture’s profitability could materially suffer if the company is unable to obtain favorable pricing for its services and solutions, if the company is unable to remain competitive, if its cost-management strategies are unsuccessful or if it experiences delivery inefficiencies; Accenture’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; as a result of Accenture’s geographically diverse operations and its growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, the company is more susceptible to certain risks; Accenture’s business could be materially adversely affected if the company incurs legal liability; Accenture’s work with government clients exposes the company to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment; if Accenture is unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with its size, the company might be unable to achieve its business objectives; if Accenture does not successfully manage and develop its relationships with key alliance partners or fails to anticipate and establish new alliances in new technologies, the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected; Accenture’s ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on its reputation in the marketplace; Accenture might not be successful at acquiring, investing in or integrating businesses, entering into joint ventures or divesting businesses; if Accenture is unable to protect its intellectual property rights or if Accenture’s services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or the company loses its ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, its business could be adversely affected; changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions Accenture makes in connection with the preparation of its consolidated financial statements could adversely affect its financial results; many of Accenture’s contracts include payments that link some of its fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require the company to meet specific service levels, which could increase the variability of the company’s revenues and impact its margins; Accenture’s results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective internal controls; Accenture might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all and if the company raises equity capital, it may dilute its shareholders’ ownership interest in the company; Accenture may be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to its incorporation in Ireland; as well as the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed under the “Risk Factors” heading in Accenture plc’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

He succeeds Chad Jerdee, who is taking on a newly created role to lead Accenture’s global strategy and programs focused on responsible business, corporate sustainability and citizenship. These changes are effective September 1, 2019.

He will join Accenture’s Global Management Committee. “Joel brings to the role of general counsel, secretary and chief compliance officer a proven track record of leadership across our legal function, as well as broad business and legal experience,” said David Rowland, interim chief executive officer. “He has served as a trusted advisor to our board and key leaders across different parts of our business and will be a great addition to our senior leadership team. “At the same time, I am delighted that Chad is stepping into this new role to drive even greater leadership for Accenture around responsible business — a commitment that has always been fundamental to how we operate and is increasingly important given the pace of technology innovation. Chad’s 22 years with Accenture position him well for this new role, and with his dedicated leadership, we will bring together our many powerful initiatives to help Accenture and our clients drive long-term sustainable growth — helping achieve our vision of innovating to improve the way the world works and lives.” Jerdee has served as Accenture’s general counsel and chief compliance officer since 2015, with a focus on enabling Accenture to operate around the globe while adhering to the highest ethical standards.
