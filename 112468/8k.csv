We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s ability to sustain given debt levels (including leases) with the cash generated from operations. In addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the Company’s credit rating. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Hamann Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ","EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 Union Pacific Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results ● Earnings per diluted share of $2.51 ● Operating revenue of $5.9 billion ● Operating income of $2.2 billion Omaha, Neb., October 19, 2023 – Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) today reported 2023 third quarter net income of $1.5 billion, or $2.51 per diluted share. This compares to 2022 third quarter net income of $1.9 billion, or $3.05 per diluted share . “We faced many challenges in the quarter, including continued inflationary pressures and a drop in carloads,” said Jim Vena, Union Pacific Chief Executive Officer. “Operationally we gained momentum through the quarter, which positions us to provide our customers with great service. Operating and safety metrics are showing solid improvement, as we increase asset utilization. We are aligning the team around our strategy focused on being the best in safety, service, and operational excellence as we drive growth to the railroad. Through our day-to-day actions, we will continue to make improvements as we exit the year.” Financial Results: Operating Revenue Reduced by Lower Fuel Surcharge Revenue and Lower Volumes Third Quarter 2023 Compared to Third Quarter 2022 ● Operating revenue of $ 5.9 billion was down 10% driven by reduced fuel surcharge revenue, lower volumes, and business mix, partially offset by core pricing gains . ● Business volumes, as measured by total revenue carloads, were down 3%. ● Operating ratio was 63.4%, up 350 basis points. Rising fuel prices during the quarter negatively impacted the operating ratio 170 basis points. ● Operating income of $2.2 billion declined 17%. Operating Performance: Service Strengthening as Resource Utilization Improves Third Quarter 2023 Compared to Third Quarter 2022 ● Quarterly freight car velocity was 200 daily miles per car, a 5% improvement. ● Quarterly locomotive productivity was 129 gross ton-miles (GTMs) per horsepower day, a 4% improvement. ● Average maximum train length was 9,537 feet, a 1% increase. 2023 Full Year Outlook Remains Relatively Unchanged ● Year to date softness in consumer-related volumes likely drive full year volume expectations below Industrial Production (Current forecast: 0.0%) ● 2023 Capital Allocation: ○ Updated capital plan of $3.7 billion ○ Maintain dividend of $1.30/quarter ○ No further 2023 share repurchases planned Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call Union Pacific will webcast its third quarter 2023 earnings release presentation live at www.up.com/investor and via teleconference on Thursday, October 19, 2023, at 8:45 a.m. Eastern Time.

Pursuant to the APA, after the consummation of the BMS-Celgene Merger and at the closing (the “ Closing ”) of the transactions contemplated by the APA (the “ Acquisition ”), Amgen will acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities from Seller for an aggregate purchase price of $13.4 billion in cash, or approximately $11.2 billion, net of the present value of anticipated future cash tax benefits. Amgen expects to fund the purchase price with current balance sheet cash. The assets to be acquired by Amgen are generally those primarily related to the OTEZLA business, including but not limited to the rights to certain intellectual property, inventory, records, contracts, permits, equipment, facilities and clinical trial data relating to or arising out of the conduct of the OTEZLA business. In addition, Seller employees whose work is primarily dedicated to the OTEZLA business will generally be transferred to Amgen or its subsidiaries in connection with the Acquisition. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the APA, Amgen will assume the liabilities arising out of the conduct of the OTEZLA business from and after the Closing, with Seller generally retaining pre-Closing liabilities and other excluded liabilities set forth in the APA. The APA further provides that Amgen and Seller will enter into certain ancillary agreements, including (a) a transition services agreement under which Amgen will receive certain transitional services, (b) a supply agreement and a toll manufacturing agreement under which Seller will, among other things, supply Amgen with the active pharmaceutical ingredients of, and other materials and services related to, OTEZLA, and (c) an intellectual property agreement providing for certain licensing arrangements between Amgen and Seller regarding certain OTEZLA-related intellectual property. The APA contains representations, warranties and covenants of Seller regarding the OTEZLA business, including a covenant to operate the OTEZLA business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice. The APA also contains representations, warranties and covenants of both Amgen and Seller relating to the Acquisition. The Closing is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, completion of the BMS-Celgene Merger, approval from the Federal Trade Commission (“ FTC ”) and any necessary government approvals. The Closing will take place following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing conditions to the Acquisition (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time). The APA provides for certain termination rights, including the right of either party to terminate the APA if Seller is notified by the Director of the Bureau of Competition of the FTC that either (a) Amgen is not an acceptable purchaser of the Transferred Assets (as defined in the APA) or (b) that the APA is not an acceptable manner of divesting the Transferred Assets (however, in the case of (b), only after the parties, consistent with their obligations under the APA, have reasonably sought to modify the APA to satisfy FTC staff). Pursuant to the APA, Seller will indemnify Amgen against losses suffered as a result of (a) a breach of Seller’s representations and warranties, (b) a breach or non-performance of any covenant that is to be performed by Seller under the APA, and (c) the Excluded Liabilities (as defined in the APA).

AMGEN INC. Date: August 26, 2019 By: /s/ Jonathan P. Graham Jonathan P. Graham Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary -;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 One Amgen Center Drive Thousand Oaks, CA 91320-1799 Telephone 805-447-1000 www.amgen.com News Releaser AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Innovative Therapy Will Strengthen Amgens Inflammation Portfolio for Patients Around the World Acquisition Expected to Accelerate Growth and Enhance Value for Amgen Shareholders Amgen to Host Call With Investors at 5 a.m. PT (8 a.m. ET) THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (Aug. 26, 2019) - Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) in connection with its previously announced merger with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) to acquire worldwide rights to Otezla ® (apremilast), the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and certain related assets and liabilities, for $13.4 billion in cash, or approximately $11.2 billion, net of the present value of $2.2 billion in anticipated future cash tax benefits. Amgen believes that the acquisition of Otezla offers many benefits including: A strong strategic fit with Amgens long-standing expertise in psoriasis and inflammation A differentiated, oral therapy complementary to Amgens existing inflammation franchise of innovative biologics and biosimilar products At least low double-digit Otezla sales growth, on average, over the next five years Acceleration of Amgens near- and long-term revenue growth Immediate non-GAAP EPS accretion Intellectual Property exclusivity through at least 2028 in the U.S. Worldwide rights which fit well with Amgens international presence and global expansion objectives Support of increased R&D investment in 2020 to advance Amgens innovative pipeline of first-in-class molecules No interruption in deployment of Amgens capital allocation priorities The acquisition of Otezla offers a unique opportunity for Amgen to provide patients an innovative oral therapy for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis that fits squarely within our portfolio and complements our Enbrel ® and AMGEVITA ® brands, said Robert A. Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer at Amgen. We will take advantage of our 20 years of experience in inflammatory disease to realize the full global potential of Otezla as an affordable option for patients with these serious, chronic inflammatory conditions. AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Page 2 Otezla is the leading treatment in the post-topical, pre-biologic segment in its approved indications. Otezla is currently approved for three indications in the U.S.the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy; adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis; and adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçets Disease. Otezla is approved in more than 50 markets outside the U.S., including the European Union and Japan, and has patent exclusivity through at least 2028 in the U.S. Sales of Otezla in 2018 were $1.6 billion driven by strong volume growth. Amgen has stated previously that it will focus on medicines that can deliver sustained, long-term volume driven growth and the Company believes there is a significant opportunity to grow Otezla through global expansion and new indications, with expectations for Otezla to realize at least low double-digit sales growth, on average, over the next five years. Strategic Benefits of the Transaction This transaction will advance Amgens strategy in several ways: Bringing Innovative Medicines to Patients  The number of patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases is growing worldwide. Amgen is already a leader in this very large therapeutic category with Enbrel ® (etanercept), a biologic medicine marketed by Amgen in the U.S. and Canada to treat several chronic inflammatory diseases, including moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). ENBREL and Otezla are complementary. ENBREL is most frequently prescribed to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, while Otezla is positioned as a therapy of first-choice in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who are not satisfied with topical therapies given its differentiated mechanism of action and established efficacy and safety profile. In PsA, Otezla is positioned for use in patients early in their disease and/or with moderate joint involvement. Additionally, studies are currently underway exploring potential new indications for Otezla, including mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Expanding Geographic Reach  Otezla is approved in 54 countries, including major markets such as France, Germany and Japan. Amgen is well positioned to continue driving Otezla international sales growth. Investing for Long-Term Growth with Uninterrupted Capital Allocation Plans  The transaction is expected to contribute to Amgens near- and long-term revenue growth rate and will be immediately accretive from close to non-GAAP earnings per share growth, with acceleration thereafter. Amgen will finance the transaction with current balance sheet cash and expects to retain its investment grade credit rating. Additionally, Amgens capital allocation priorities will remain unchanged as we invest to grow our business through internal investment and business development, maintain an optimal capital structure to minimize our Weighted Average Cost of Capital and continue to provide capital returns to shareholders through a growing dividend and continued share repurchases. The closing of the acquisition is contingent on Bristol-Myers Squibb entering into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with the pending Celgene merger, the closing of the pending merger with Celgene and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2019. Otezla represents an exciting opportunity to strengthen Amgens presence in inflammation and continue Amgens geographic expansion, said Bradway. We are excited about the opportunity that Otezla represents for Amgen, for our shareholders, and for patients worldwide, and we look forward to welcoming those staff members who support Otezla to the Amgen family. AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Page 3 Dyal Co.

We use non-GAAP EPS in connection with our own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of our business. Non-GAAP EPS is derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from EPS determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from non-GAAP EPS is a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period. Historically, management has excluded the following items from non-GAAP EPS, and such items may also be excluded in future periods and could be significant: expenses related to acquisition of businesses, including amortization and/or impairment of acquired in intangible assets, including in-process research and development, inventory step-ups, adjustments to contingent consideration, integration costs, severance and retention costs and transaction costs; charges associated with restructuring or cost saving initiatives, including but not limited to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, severance costs and lease abandonment charges; legal settlements or awards; non-routine settlements with tax authorities; and the impact of the adoption of the U.S. corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

About OTEZLA ® (apremilast) OTEZLA ® (apremilast) 30 mg tablets is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which OTEZLA exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined. AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Page 4 U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION INDICATIONS Otezla ® (apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Contraindications Otezla ® (apremilast) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulation. Warnings and Precautions Diarrhea, Nausea and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Depression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occur. Psoriasis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.3% (12/920) of patients reported depression compared to 0.4% (2/506) on placebo. Depression was reported as serious in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/506). Suicidal behavior was observed in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients on Otezla, compared to 0.2% (1/506) on placebo. One patient treated with Otezla attempted suicide; one patient on placebo committed suicide. Psoriatic Arthritis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.0% (10/998) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 0.8% (4/495) treated with placebo. Suicidal ideation and behavior was observed in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients on Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients. Depression was reported as serious in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/495). Two patients who received placebo committed suicide compared to none on Otezla. Behçets Disease: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During the clinical trial, 1% (1/104) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 1% (1/103) treated with placebo. No instances of suicidal ideation or behavior were reported in patients treated with Otezla or treated with placebo. Weight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of Otezla. Psoriasis: Body weight loss of 5-10% occurred in 12% (96/784) of patients treated with Otezla and in 5% (19/382) of patients treated with placebo. Body weight loss of ³ 10% occurred in 2% (16/784) of patients treated with Otezla compared to 1% (3/382) of patients treated with placebo.

Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Otezla during pregnancy. Information about the registry can be obtained by calling 1-877-311-8972 or visiting https://mothertobaby.org/ongoing-study/otezla/ . Lactation: There are no data on the presence of apremilast or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of apremilast on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for Otezla and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Otezla or from the underlying maternal condition. Renal Impairment: Otezla dosage should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min); for details, see Dosage and Administration, Section 2, in the Full Prescribing Information.

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of the transaction described in this press release, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Page 6 customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

In addition, Seller employees whose work is primarily dedicated to the OTEZLA business will generally be transferred to Amgen or its subsidiaries in connection with the Acquisition. Subject to certain exceptions specified in the APA, Amgen will assume the liabilities arising out of the conduct of the OTEZLA business from and after the Closing, with Seller generally retaining pre-Closing liabilities and other excluded liabilities set forth in the APA. The APA further provides that Amgen and Seller will enter into certain ancillary agreements, including (a) a transition services agreement under which Amgen will receive certain transitional services, (b) a supply agreement and a toll manufacturing agreement under which Seller will, among other things, supply Amgen with the active pharmaceutical ingredients of, and other materials and services related to, OTEZLA, and (c) an intellectual property agreement providing for certain licensing arrangements between Amgen and Seller regarding certain OTEZLA-related intellectual property.

AMGEN INC. Date: August 26, 2019 By: /s/ Jonathan P. Graham Jonathan P. Graham Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary ","EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 One Amgen Center Drive Thousand Oaks, CA 91320-1799 Telephone 805-447-1000 www.amgen.com News Releaser AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Innovative Therapy Will Strengthen Amgens Inflammation Portfolio for Patients Around the World Acquisition Expected to Accelerate Growth and Enhance Value for Amgen Shareholders Amgen to Host Call With Investors at 5 a.m. PT (8 a.m. ET) THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (Aug. 26, 2019) - Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) in connection with its previously announced merger with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) to acquire worldwide rights to Otezla ® (apremilast), the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and certain related assets and liabilities, for $13.4 billion in cash, or approximately $11.2 billion, net of the present value of $2.2 billion in anticipated future cash tax benefits. Amgen believes that the acquisition of Otezla offers many benefits including: A strong strategic fit with Amgens long-standing expertise in psoriasis and inflammation A differentiated, oral therapy complementary to Amgens existing inflammation franchise of innovative biologics and biosimilar products At least low double-digit Otezla sales growth, on average, over the next five years Acceleration of Amgens near- and long-term revenue growth Immediate non-GAAP EPS accretion Intellectual Property exclusivity through at least 2028 in the U.S. Worldwide rights which fit well with Amgens international presence and global expansion objectives Support of increased R&D investment in 2020 to advance Amgens innovative pipeline of first-in-class molecules No interruption in deployment of Amgens capital allocation priorities The acquisition of Otezla offers a unique opportunity for Amgen to provide patients an innovative oral therapy for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis that fits squarely within our portfolio and complements our Enbrel ® and AMGEVITA ® brands, said Robert A. Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer at Amgen. We will take advantage of our 20 years of experience in inflammatory disease to realize the full global potential of Otezla as an affordable option for patients with these serious, chronic inflammatory conditions. AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Page 2 Otezla is the leading treatment in the post-topical, pre-biologic segment in its approved indications. Otezla is currently approved for three indications in the U.S.the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy; adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis; and adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçets Disease. Otezla is approved in more than 50 markets outside the U.S., including the European Union and Japan, and has patent exclusivity through at least 2028 in the U.S. Sales of Otezla in 2018 were $1.6 billion driven by strong volume growth. Amgen has stated previously that it will focus on medicines that can deliver sustained, long-term volume driven growth and the Company believes there is a significant opportunity to grow Otezla through global expansion and new indications, with expectations for Otezla to realize at least low double-digit sales growth, on average, over the next five years. Strategic Benefits of the Transaction This transaction will advance Amgens strategy in several ways: Bringing Innovative Medicines to Patients  The number of patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases is growing worldwide. Amgen is already a leader in this very large therapeutic category with Enbrel ® (etanercept), a biologic medicine marketed by Amgen in the U.S. and Canada to treat several chronic inflammatory diseases, including moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). ENBREL and Otezla are complementary. ENBREL is most frequently prescribed to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, while Otezla is positioned as a therapy of first-choice in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who are not satisfied with topical therapies given its differentiated mechanism of action and established efficacy and safety profile. In PsA, Otezla is positioned for use in patients early in their disease and/or with moderate joint involvement. Additionally, studies are currently underway exploring potential new indications for Otezla, including mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Expanding Geographic Reach  Otezla is approved in 54 countries, including major markets such as France, Germany and Japan. Amgen is well positioned to continue driving Otezla international sales growth. Investing for Long-Term Growth with Uninterrupted Capital Allocation Plans  The transaction is expected to contribute to Amgens near- and long-term revenue growth rate and will be immediately accretive from close to non-GAAP earnings per share growth, with acceleration thereafter. Amgen will finance the transaction with current balance sheet cash and expects to retain its investment grade credit rating. Additionally, Amgens capital allocation priorities will remain unchanged as we invest to grow our business through internal investment and business development, maintain an optimal capital structure to minimize our Weighted Average Cost of Capital and continue to provide capital returns to shareholders through a growing dividend and continued share repurchases. The closing of the acquisition is contingent on Bristol-Myers Squibb entering into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in connection with the pending Celgene merger, the closing of the pending merger with Celgene and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2019. Otezla represents an exciting opportunity to strengthen Amgens presence in inflammation and continue Amgens geographic expansion, said Bradway. We are excited about the opportunity that Otezla represents for Amgen, for our shareholders, and for patients worldwide, and we look forward to welcoming those staff members who support Otezla to the Amgen family. AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Page 3 Dyal Co.

We use non-GAAP EPS in connection with our own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of our business. Non-GAAP EPS is derived by excluding certain amounts, expenses or income, from EPS determined in accordance with GAAP. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from non-GAAP EPS is a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period. Historically, management has excluded the following items from non-GAAP EPS, and such items may also be excluded in future periods and could be significant: expenses related to acquisition of businesses, including amortization and/or impairment of acquired in intangible assets, including in-process research and development, inventory step-ups, adjustments to contingent consideration, integration costs, severance and retention costs and transaction costs; charges associated with restructuring or cost saving initiatives, including but not limited to asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, severance costs and lease abandonment charges; legal settlements or awards; non-routine settlements with tax authorities; and the impact of the adoption of the U.S. corporate tax reform. Non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

About OTEZLA ® (apremilast) OTEZLA ® (apremilast) 30 mg tablets is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which is thought to indirectly modulate the production of inflammatory mediators. The specific mechanism(s) by which OTEZLA exerts its therapeutic action in patients is not well defined. AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Page 4 U.S. PRESCRIBING INFORMATION INDICATIONS Otezla ® (apremilast) is indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Otezla is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers associated with Behçets Disease. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Contraindications Otezla ® (apremilast) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or to any of the excipients in the formulation. Warnings and Precautions Diarrhea, Nausea and Vomiting: Cases of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting were associated with the use of Otezla. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting; advise patients to contact their healthcare provider. Consider Otezla dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Depression: Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with Otezla for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts/behavior, or in patients who develop such symptoms while on Otezla. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such changes occur. Psoriasis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.3% (12/920) of patients reported depression compared to 0.4% (2/506) on placebo. Depression was reported as serious in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/506). Suicidal behavior was observed in 0.1% (1/1308) of patients on Otezla, compared to 0.2% (1/506) on placebo. One patient treated with Otezla attempted suicide; one patient on placebo committed suicide. Psoriatic Arthritis: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During clinical trials, 1.0% (10/998) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 0.8% (4/495) treated with placebo. Suicidal ideation and behavior was observed in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients on Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients. Depression was reported as serious in 0.2% (3/1441) of patients exposed to Otezla, compared to none in placebo-treated patients (0/495). Two patients who received placebo committed suicide compared to none on Otezla. Behçets Disease: Treatment with Otezla is associated with an increase in depression. During the clinical trial, 1% (1/104) reported depression or depressed mood compared to 1% (1/103) treated with placebo. No instances of suicidal ideation or behavior were reported in patients treated with Otezla or treated with placebo. Weight Decrease: Monitor body weight regularly; evaluate unexplained or clinically significant weight loss, and consider discontinuation of Otezla. Psoriasis: Body weight loss of 5-10% occurred in 12% (96/784) of patients treated with Otezla and in 5% (19/382) of patients treated with placebo. Body weight loss of ³ 10% occurred in 2% (16/784) of patients treated with Otezla compared to 1% (3/382) of patients treated with placebo. AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Page 5 Psoriatic Arthritis: Body weight loss of 5-10% was reported in 10% (49/497) of patients taking Otezla and in 3.3% (16/495) of patients taking placebo. Behçets Disease: Body weight loss of >5% was reported in 4.9% (5/103) of patients taking Otezla and in 3.9% (4/102) of patients taking placebo. Drug Interactions: Apremilast exposure was decreased when Otezla was co-administered with rifampin, a strong CYP450 enzyme inducer; loss of Otezla efficacy may occur. Concomitant use of Otezla with CYP450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is not recommended. Adverse Reactions Psoriasis: Adverse reactions reported in ³ 5% of patients were (Otezla%, placebo%): diarrhea (17, 6), nausea (17, 7), upper respiratory tract infection (9, 6), tension headache (8, 4), and headache (6, 4). Psoriatic Arthritis: Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients taking Otezla, that occurred at a frequency at least 1% higher than that observed in patients taking placebo, for up to 16 weeks (after the initial 5-day titration), were (Otezla%, placebo%): diarrhea (7.7, 1.6); nausea (8.9, 3.1); headache (5.9, 2.2); upper respiratory tract infection (3.9, 1.8); vomiting (3.2, 0.4); nasopharyngitis (2.6, 1.6); upper abdominal pain (2.0, 0.2).

Use in Specific Populations Pregnancy: Otezla has not been studied in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal loss. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Otezla during pregnancy. Information about the registry can be obtained by calling 1-877-311-8972 or visiting https://mothertobaby.org/ongoing-study/otezla/ . Lactation: There are no data on the presence of apremilast or its metabolites in human milk, the effects of apremilast on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mothers clinical need for Otezla and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Otezla or from the underlying maternal condition. Renal Impairment: Otezla dosage should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min); for details, see Dosage and Administration, Section 2, in the Full Prescribing Information.

Amgen Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of the transaction described in this press release, including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion, as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, AMGEN TO ACQUIRE OTEZLA ® FOR $13.4 BILLION IN CASH, OR APPROXIMATELY $11.2 BILLION NET OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH TAX BENEFITS Page 6 customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

On July 30, 2019 , Amgen Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , and its unaudited financial position as of June 30, 2019 . The full text of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. In its press release the Company included certain non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures included in the press release are non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating expenses and sub-components of non-GAAP operating expenses such as non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses. Reconciliations for such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. The Company also included Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company’s ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company’s liquidity. The following is a summary of the costs and other items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to calculate non-GAAP financial measures: • Acquisition-related expenses: Acquisition-related charges are primarily associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions. Such charges include amortization of developed-product-technology rights, licensing rights, R&D technology rights, and marketing-related rights, as well as impairments of in-process R&D assets. The Company incurs charges related to these intangibles, and those charges are included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Charges for purchased intangible assets are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company’s acquisitions and potential product approvals as they relate to in-process R&D projects acquired. Accordingly, these charges may vary in amount from period to period. The Company excludes these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance. The Company believes that excluding the noncash charges related to those intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past and, thus, provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company’s acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally-developed-intellectual property. • Net charges pursuant to the Company’s restructuring initiative: Restructuring costs are primarily related to facilities charges, including accelerated depreciation, and severance and benefits for employees terminated pursuant to the transformation and process improvement efforts. Restructuring costs are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, although the Company may incur these types of expenses in the future, it believes that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and facilitates comparisons to past operating performance. • Other items: The Company adjusts GAAP financial results for certain expenses associated with judgments and/or settlements for legal proceedings discussed in our filings. The Company excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented because the Company believes these items are outside the ordinary course of business. The Company believes eliminating these expenses provides a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and facilitates comparisons to past operating performance. • The tax effect of the adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP results take into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. The press release also contains a discussion of the additional purposes for which the Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures. This information and the information contained in the press release shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

Cost of Sales margin increased 0.2 percentage points due primarily to product mix, offset partially by the benefit of Hurricane Maria insurance proceeds and lower manufacturing costs.

Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 7 % driven primarily by reduced discretionary general and administrative expenses and the end of certain acquisition-related intangible asset amortization charges in 2018. • Operating Margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 48.0 %. • Tax Rate increased 1.7 percentage points due primarily to a prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform.

In addition, management has presented its full year 2019 EPS and tax rate guidance in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain items related to acquisitions, restructuring and certain other items from the related GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the news release. Management has also presented Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018 . FCF is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company’s ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company’s liquidity. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures set forth in the news release in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. The non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties AMGEN REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS Page 8 or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. ### CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks Trish Hawkins, 805-447-5631 (media) Arvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors) AMGEN REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS Page 9 Amgen Inc.

(b) For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the adjustment related to the net gain associated with the Kirin-Amgen share acquisition. (c) The tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and non-GAAP results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Due to these factors, the effective tax rates for the adjustments to our GAAP income before income taxes, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, were 23.7% and 23.3%, compared with 24.7% and 25.7% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.

On July 30, 2019 , Amgen Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 , and its unaudited financial position as of June 30, 2019 . The full text of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. In its press release the Company included certain non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures included in the press release are non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating expenses and sub-components of non-GAAP operating expenses such as non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses. Reconciliations for such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. The Company also included Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company’s ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company’s liquidity. The following is a summary of the costs and other items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to calculate non-GAAP financial measures: • Acquisition-related expenses: Acquisition-related charges are primarily associated with intangible assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions. Such charges include amortization of developed-product-technology rights, licensing rights, R&D technology rights, and marketing-related rights, as well as impairments of in-process R&D assets. The Company incurs charges related to these intangibles, and those charges are included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Charges for purchased intangible assets are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Company’s acquisitions and potential product approvals as they relate to in-process R&D projects acquired. Accordingly, these charges may vary in amount from period to period. The Company excludes these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and comparisons to past operating performance. The Company believes that excluding the noncash charges related to those intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past and, thus, provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company’s acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally-developed-intellectual property. • Net charges pursuant to the Company’s restructuring initiative: Restructuring costs are primarily related to facilities charges, including accelerated depreciation, and severance and benefits for employees terminated pursuant to the transformation and process improvement efforts. Restructuring costs are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, although the Company may incur these types of expenses in the future, it believes that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and facilitates comparisons to past operating performance. • Other items: The Company adjusts GAAP financial results for certain expenses associated with judgments and/or settlements for legal proceedings discussed in our filings. The Company excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures presented because the Company believes these items are outside the ordinary course of business. The Company believes eliminating these expenses provides a supplemental evaluation of the Company’s current operating performance and facilitates comparisons to past operating performance. • The tax effect of the adjustments between GAAP and non-GAAP results take into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. The press release also contains a discussion of the additional purposes for which the Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures. This information and the information contained in the press release shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. The information in Item 2.02 of this Current Report is not incorporated by reference into any filings of the Company made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, whether made before or after the date of this Current Report, regardless of any general incorporation language in the filing unless specifically stated so therein.

Cost of Sales margin increased 0.2 percentage points due primarily to product mix, offset partially by the benefit of Hurricane Maria insurance proceeds and lower manufacturing costs. Research & Development (R&D) expenses increased 6 % driven primarily by increased spending in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, offset partially by decreased spending in support of marketed products. Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 7 % driven primarily by reduced discretionary general and administrative expenses and the end of certain acquisition-related intangible asset amortization charges in 2018. • Operating Margin decreased 1.9 percentage points to 48.0 %. • Tax Rate increased 1.7 percentage points due primarily to a prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform.

In addition, management has presented its full year 2019 EPS and tax rate guidance in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain items related to acquisitions, restructuring and certain other items from the related GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the news release. Management has also presented Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the second quarters of 2019 and 2018 . FCF is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company’s ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company’s liquidity. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures set forth in the news release in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. The non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations and beliefs of Amgen. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties AMGEN REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS Page 8 or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. ### CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks Trish Hawkins, 805-447-5631 (media) Arvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors) AMGEN REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS Page 9 Amgen Inc.

(b) For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the adjustment related to the net gain associated with the Kirin-Amgen share acquisition. (c) The tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and non-GAAP results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Due to these factors, the effective tax rates for the adjustments to our GAAP income before income taxes, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, were 23.7% and 23.3%, compared with 24.7% and 25.7% for the corresponding periods of the prior year.
