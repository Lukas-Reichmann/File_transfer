The repurchased shares of Series C Preferred Stock were originally issued to the Seller on May 10, 2023, in connection with the Company’s entry into a Sale, Purchase and Assignment Deed with the Seller and other parties to terminate the Company’s obligations relating to contractual gold payments. As consideration for the transactions contemplated by the Repurchase Agreement (collectively, the “Stock Repurchase”), the Company agreed to pay the Seller aggregate cash consideration of approximately $84.4 million (the “Aggregate Purchase Price”), such Aggregate Purchase Price to be paid in four installments. The Company paid the initial consideration to Seller on the closing date of the Stock Repurchase in the amount of $40 million (the “Initial Repurchase Consideration”).

The Repurchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties. The Stock Repurchase closed on November 20, 2023, and the shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been cancelled and retired. The Stock Repurchase was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The foregoing summary of the Repurchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Repurchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. In connection with entry into the Repurchase Agreement, the Company and the Seller also entered into a Termination Agreement on November 20, 2023, which terminated the Investor Rights Agreement by and between the Company and the Seller dated as of May 10, 2023 (the “Investor Rights Agreement”). The terminated Investor Rights Agreement formerly provided the Seller with certain rights and obligations with respect to its shares of Series C Preferred Stock, including registration rights. The foregoing summary of the Termination Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Termination Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference. In connection with entry into the Repurchase Agreement, on November 20, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Elimination to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, eliminating from the Charter all references to the Series C Preferred Stock set forth in the Company’s Certificate of Designations with respect to its Series C Preferred Stock. No shares of Series C Preferred Stock were outstanding at the time the Certification of Elimination was filed. The Certificate of Elimination became effective on November 20, 2023.

On November 20, 2023, the Company issued a press release announcing the Stock Repurchase, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act. (d) Exhibits SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. -;-EX-99.1: Exhibit 99.1 WisdomTree Completes Repurchase of Non-Voting Preferred Shares Convertible into 13.1 Million Shares of WisdomTree Common Stock from a Subsidiary of the World Gold Council Repurchase is 7% accretive to current 2024 consensus EPS estimates NEW YORK, November 20, 2023 – WisdomTree, Inc. (NYSE: WT) (“WisdomTree” or the “Company”), a global financial innovator, today announced the completion of the repurchase of its non-voting preferred shares convertible into 13.1 million shares of WisdomTree common stock from Gold Bullion Holdings (Jersey) Limited (“GBH”), a subsidiary of the World Gold Council, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $84.4 million, derived from a price per share (on an as-converted basis) of $6.45. The preferred shares have been fully extinguished and the transaction is approximately 7% accretive to current 2024 consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) estimates. WisdomTree Founder and CEO Jonathan Steinberg said, “This repurchase eliminates potential future overhang while generating 7% accretion for stockholders today. It is yet another example of smart management generating impactful results in addition to WisdomTree’s best-in-class pace of organic growth relative to our publicly-traded asset manager peers, the scalability of our platform and our leadership in tokenization and blockchain-enabled finance.” Under the terms of the transaction, WisdomTree paid GBH $40 million on the closing date and has agreed to pay the remainder of the purchase price in equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the closing date, with no requirement to pay interest. The $6.45 price per share (on an as-converted basis) represents a 3% discount to the trailing 3-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of WisdomTree’s common stock ending Friday, November 17, 2023. Recent proactive actions by WisdomTree’s management team have generated both earnings accretion and ancillary benefits. The termination of WisdomTree’s contractual gold payment obligation (“gold royalty buyout”) this past May was 15% accretive to earnings and removed a perpetual stream of payments from the Company’s P&L and a $180 million liability from its balance sheet. Today’s share repurchase generates an additional 7% accretion to Street forecasts and removes a potential risk of overhang on WisdomTree’s stock price had GBH disposed of the 13.1 million shares of common stock underlying the preferred shares by other means. The repurchased preferred shares were originally issued to GBH in May 2023 in connection with the gold royalty buyout. The investor rights agreement that WisdomTree and GBH entered into in May 2023, which provided GBH with certain rights and obligations with respect to the shares, including registration rights, was terminated in connection with this transaction. For further information regarding the terms and conditions contained in the stock repurchase agreement and other definitive transaction agreements between WisdomTree and GBH, see WisdomTree’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the transaction.

AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (in thousands) (Unaudited) Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, 2023 2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measurements In an effort to provide additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful and meaningful information. Our management reviews these non-GAAP financial measurements when evaluating our financial performance and results of operations; therefore, we believe it is useful to provide information with respect to these non-GAAP measurements so as to share this perspective of management. Non-GAAP measurements do not have any standardized meaning, do not replace nor are superior to GAAP financial measurements and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measurements should be considered in the context with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measurements contained in this press release include: Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Expenses, Income Before Income Taxes, Income Tax Expense, Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share We disclose adjusted operating income, operating expenses, income before income taxes, income tax expense, net income and diluted earnings per share as non-GAAP financial measurements in order to report our results exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financial measurements provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our performance. These non-GAAP financial measurements exclude the following: Unrealized gains or losses on revaluation/termination of deferred consideration—gold payments: Deferred consideration—gold payments was an obligation we assumed in connection with the ETFS acquisition that was carried at fair value. This item represented the present value of an obligation to pay fixed ounces of gold into perpetuity and is measured using forward-looking gold prices. Changes in the forward-looking price of gold and changes in the discount rate used to compute the present value of the annual payment obligations have had a material impact on the carrying value of the deferred consideration and our reported financial results. We exclude this item when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as it was not core to our operating business. The item was not adjusted for income taxes as the obligation was assumed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours that is based in Jersey, a jurisdiction where we are subject to a zero percent tax rate. During the second quarter of 2023, we terminated this obligation for aggregate consideration totaling approximately $137.0 million. Gains or losses on financial instruments owned: We account for our financial instruments owned as trading securities, which requires these instruments to be measured at fair value with gains and losses reported in net income. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as the gains and losses introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business. Tax windfalls and shortfalls upon vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation awards: GAAP requires the recognition of tax windfalls and shortfalls within income tax expense. These items arise upon the vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation awards and the magnitude is directly correlated to the number of awards vesting/exercised as well as the difference between the price of our stock on the date the award was granted and the date the award vested or was exercised. We exclude these items when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements as they introduce volatility in earnings and are not core to our operating business. Other items: Loss on extinguishment of our convertible notes, impairments, remeasurement of contingent consideration payable to us from the sale of our former Canadian ETF business, unrealized gains and losses recognized on our investments, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowance, expenses incurred in response to an activist campaign and litigation expenses associated with certain provisions of our Stockholder Rights Agreement dated as of March 17, 2023, as amended with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent, are excluded when calculating our non-GAAP financial measurements. Adjusted Effective Income Tax Rate We disclose our adjusted effective income tax rate as a non-GAAP financial measurement in order to report our effective income tax rate exclusive of items that are non-recurring or not core to our operating business. We believe reporting our adjusted effective income tax rate provides investors with a consistent way to analyze our income taxes. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted income before income taxes. See above for information regarding the items that are excluded. Gross Margin and Gross Margin Percentage We disclose our gross margin and gross margin percentage as non-GAAP financial measurements because we believe they provide investors with a consistent way to analyze the amount we retain after paying third-party service providers to operate our ETPs. These measures also assist us in analyzing the profitability of our products. We define gross margin as total operating revenues less fund management and administration expenses. Gross margin percentage is calculated as gross margin divided by total operating revenues. WISDOMTREE, INC.

If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties occur, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual events or results may vary significantly from those implied or projected by the forward-looking statements. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance.
